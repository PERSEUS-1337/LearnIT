The Secretary will establish guidelines for health care coverage in child support orders, including insurance provision, claims payment, rights to insurance information, coverage denial circumstances, penalties for non-compliance, and consideration of changes in parents' circumstances. The State must prioritize the child's best interests and parents' financial circumstances when developing these standards.
