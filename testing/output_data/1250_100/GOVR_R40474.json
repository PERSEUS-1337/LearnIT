    "content": "This report analyzes recent laws and congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions under the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act of 1976, the proposed Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District. This report analyzes the differences between recent laws and congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia, focusing on the impact of the FCAA and the IPAA. It discusses the congressional activity following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home and declared unconstitutional certain provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend the city's gun laws temporarily. This attempt was met with criticism as some felt the changes did not comply with the Heller decision. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to temporarily amend its gun laws. In response, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in the 110th Congress to overturn or loosen provisions of the District's existing gun laws. The content of H.R. 6691 was later adopted into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House of Representatives but did not become law. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160, which was approved by the Senate and became Title II of S. 160. Despite movement on this legislation being stalled, the DC Council continued to enact emergency legislation until permanent legislation could be established. In 2009, the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and later upheld in court. These acts amended firearms provisions in response to the Heller case and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation. Congressional legislation, such as H.R. 645, also aimed to change the District's gun laws. H.R. 645 seeks to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, taking into consideration the FCAA and IPAA. It would limit the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repeal the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards, allowing states and territories to supplement them with their own laws. The District has authority to create its own laws under the Home Rule Act. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the power to create laws within the District, including regulations on firearms. While Congress can still legislate for the District and impose limits on its authority, the Act allows the District to amend laws previously passed by Congress. The District of Columbia can amend or repeal congressional enactments depending on whether Congress intended such acts to be amended. Congressional limits on the District's authority to legislate on firearms are outlined in specific provisions like Section 3 of H.R. 645. The District of Columbia is restricted by federal law from enacting laws that discourage private ownership of firearms. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the Council cannot create laws related to firearms regulation. It also prevents the District from prohibiting possession of firearms not already regulated by federal law. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the District of Columbia from creating laws that discourage private firearm ownership. It also limits the District's ability to regulate firearms beyond federal laws, except for carrying firearms outside of specific locations. The District of Columbia could regulate concealed or open carry but may not be able to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The definition of \"machine gun\" in the DC Code prior to Heller included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. Under the NFA, a \"machine gun\" is defined as a weapon that can shoot automatically without manual reloading. The District of Columbia amended its definition to allow registration of semiautomatic firearms, but also enacted a list of prohibited firearms. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, aligning with the federal definition. The DC Code previously prohibited registration of certain firearms, including sawed-off shotguns and machine guns. However, post-Heller, the District now allows registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns. Additionally, there is an exemption from registration for individuals temporarily possessing a firearm registered to another person while in the home of the registrant. The Firearms Control Amendment Act (FCAA) prohibits certain individuals from registering a firearm, such as those with a history of violent behavior or convictions for intrafamily offenses or DUIs. Applicants must also complete a firearms training course and provide a signed affidavit. The Firearms Control Amendment Act (FCAA) requires individuals to complete a firearms training course and provide an affidavit signed by a certified instructor. The Chief of Police must conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and is limited to registering one pistol per person every 30 days. H.R. 645 would eliminate the registration requirement for firearms in DC, removing the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. H.R. 645 would repeal the FCAA provisions, removing the registration requirement for firearms in DC and eliminating restrictions on the number of handguns an individual can purchase per month. It would also allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the need for a licensed dealer to track ammunition inventory. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose different ways to permit interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 would amend federal law to allow licensed dealers in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. On the other hand, H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to treat Maryland and Virginia firearms dealers as licensed dealers under DC law, allowing them to sell handguns to District residents. The GCA requires licensed dealers to sell or deliver handguns with secure gun storage or safety devices. The District of Columbia's trigger lock requirement, previously declared unconstitutional, now mandates that firearms in lawful possession be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. The FCAA prohibits storing loaded firearms where minors can access them without permission, with penalties for violations. H.R. 645 creates penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. The bill prohibits minors from accessing firearms without permission, with penalties for violations including fines and imprisonment. Exceptions include secure storage, self-defense, hunting under supervision, and law enforcement possession. The bill prohibits minors from accessing firearms without permission, with penalties for violations including fines and imprisonment. Exceptions include secure storage, self-defense, hunting under supervision, and law enforcement possession. Under DC law, violations of the registration scheme for firearms can result in fines or imprisonment. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision, removing criminal penalties for certain firearm-related offenses. The District of Columbia amended its firearms laws to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. The IPAA allows property owners in DC to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. H.R. 645 addresses property owners' rights to restrict firearms on their property. The proposed legislation in H.R. 645 would allow property owners in the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. This provision differs from existing DC law by further limiting private landlords' ability to restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their premises. Additionally, the legislation grants the District the authority to restrict or prohibit firearms on public property with enhanced security measures, while exempting lessees occupying residential or business premises. The proposed language in H.R. 645 would narrow the application of firearm regulations in the District of Columbia to \"buildings or structures under its control.\" It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms on real property other than buildings and structures. The legislation exempts lessees occupying residential or business premises from the granted authority, but it is ambiguous which types of buildings the District can regulate firearm possession in. The IPAA repealed the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, which would be reinstated by H.R. 645. The bill also prohibits carrying rifles or shotguns in DC, with exceptions. States can also impose their own firearm laws. The District currently allows registered firearm owners to carry within their home or for recreational purposes. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in certain circumstances, such as in their dwelling house, place of business, or while engaged in lawful recreational activities. This bill aims to restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses in DC. If H.R. 645 is enacted, firearm owners could obtain concealed carry licenses and carry their firearms outside specific circumstances. The bill would allow lawful transportation of firearms, requiring them to be unloaded and secured during transport. Additionally, toy and antique pistols were included as types of firearms in the District Code. H.R. 645 includes a technical change to the District Code by prohibiting toy and antique pistols from being used in violent or dangerous crimes. It grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. The bill repeals the registration scheme, making it unnecessary for the office to have jurisdiction over firearm registration certificates. Additionally, H.R. 645 would repeal the FCAA and IPAA, restoring previous provisions of the DC Code. The DC Code's provisions for dealer's licenses and firearm sales are dependent on obtaining a registration certificate. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration scheme, allowing more individuals to qualify for a dealer's license and engage in firearm transactions. Duties such as reporting firearm loss or theft would also be repealed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, and others. It is illegal to sell a firearm to someone who falls into these categories. The FCAA imposes new eligibility requirements for firearm transfers under DC law. Non-licensed individuals can only sell or transfer firearms to licensed dealers. H.R. 645 would remove registration requirements under DC law, relying solely on federal disqualifications for transfers. The assault weapons ban under the FCAA would also be affected by H.R. 645. The FCAA created a new definition of \"assault weapon\" that includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols based on military-type characteristics. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat. Antique firearms and certain pistols for Olympic target shooting are excluded from this definition. Manufacturers, importers, or dealers of assault weapons can be held strictly liable under the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990. The FCAA prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC. This includes devices capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Despite allowing registration of semiautomatic firearms, residents are restricted from owning such devices. This provision would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers must conduct background checks before transferring firearms. Non-licensed individuals are not required to undergo background checks under federal law. The DC Code previously imposed a 48-hour waiting period for pistol transfers, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days. The IPAA expands the waiting period to apply to all firearms, not just pistols. If the IPAA is repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA introduces new provisions regarding microstamping for semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. The FCAA introduces new sections 503 and 504. Section 503 outlines requirements for microstamp-ready semiautomatic pistols and mandates manufacturers to provide information to law enforcement. Section 504 prohibits the sale or possession of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned and registered prior to that date. Residents can only sell or transfer such pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the California Roster annually for updates. The Chief is authorized to review the California Roster annually for updates and revise the roster of handguns deemed not unsafe. The District prohibits the discharge of firearms without a special permit, allows restrictions on possession of firearms on its property, and permits private property owners to do the same, except for law enforcement personnel. These provisions would be repealed if H.R. 645 became law."
