    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for five years. The program has received multiple short-term extensions since its original funding authority expired in 2002. Both Senate bill S. 667 and House bill H.R. 240 aim to extend TANF funding at current levels through FY2010 and include President Bush's proposal for \"marriage promotion\" grants. The comparison between Senate bill S. 667 and House bill H.R. 240 focuses on TANF provisions, particularly in terms of work participation standards and funding for child care. S. 667 proposes to add $6 billion over five years to mandatory child care funding, while H.R. 240 suggests adding $1 billion over the same period. The major difference lies in how they handle TANF contingency funds, with S. 667 completely revamping them and H.R. 240 making minor revisions. The TANF law (P.L. 104-193) provides states with a fixed basic block grant and maintenance of effort requirement. The funding levels have not been adjusted for inflation or changes in caseloads. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to maintain current funding levels without adjustments through FY2010. Supplemental grants totaling $319 million per year have been provided to 17 states with high population growth or historically low grant levels. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose to continue these grants for the same states through FY2009. Additionally, TANF includes a contingency fund to provide extra matching grants to states in economic need, with H.R. 240 maintaining the fund on existing rules. The TANF contingency fund is addressed in H.R. 240 and S. 667, with H.R. 240 making minor modifications and S. 667 revamping the fund entirely. S. 667 eliminates certain requirements for states to qualify for contingency funds and bases grants on estimated cash assistance caseloads. Federal TANF grants and MOE funds can be used for various benefits and services to assist low-income families with children. Up to 30% of the grant can be transferred to the Child Care and Development Fund. Up to 30% of the TANF grant can be transferred to the Child Care and Development Fund and the Social Services Block Grant. The limit on transfers to SSBG is set at 4.25%, but both bills aim to permanently set it at 10%. H.R. 240 proposes raising the overall transfer limit to 50%, while S. 667 would retain the current 30% limit. Both bills include provisions to ease rules on TANF fund usage, allowing states to use carryover funds for any TANF benefit and service, excluding child care and transportation aid from the definition of \"assistance.\" The bills, S. 667 and H.R. 240, propose changes to TANF regulations. They aim to exclude child care and transportation aid from the definition of \"assistance,\" freeing nonworking families from certain requirements. Both bills incorporate the \"universal engagement\" proposal, requiring states to develop self-sufficiency plans for adult recipients. H.R. 240 also includes a \"full family sanction\" for noncompliance with work participation rules. The bills would raise work participation standards from 50% to 70%, increase required working hours, and revise the list of activities for credit towards TANF standards. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to raise the work participation standard for all families to 70% by FY2010 and eliminate the separate standard for two-parent families. They also propose changes to the credits that reduce these standards, but do so in different ways. The current law is being revised to measure caseload reduction based on the most recent four years, with an additional credit for states achieving a 60% reduction from FY1995 to FY2001. Starting in FY2008, the caseload reduction credit will be replaced with a credit for employed welfare leavers. The minimum effective standard will be 10% in FY2006, increasing to 50% in FY2010. Hours standards require a minimum number of hours per week for participation, with higher requirements for two-parent families. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose raising the hours standards for TANF work participation. H.R. 240 suggests a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, with partial credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation. Single parents with preschoolers would not have a special lower-hour standard. S. 667 also raises the hours standard, with single parents with a preschool child eligible for full credit at 24 hours per week, and other single-parent families at 34 hours per week. Two-parent families would have higher hours requirements. Creditable activities include work, job search, vocational training, and community service. H.R. 240 and S. 667 propose different standards for TANF work participation. H.R. 240 narrows the list of core activities, giving states discretion for three months in a 24-month period. After that, only work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience count towards the standards. Job search and vocational education are not included as core activities. Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 propose changes to TANF work participation standards. S. 667 allows states to count an expanded list of activities for a limited time period, in addition to core activities like job search and vocational education. States can define activities for families meeting core work requirements, with S. 667 offering more options for counting participation towards work standards. S. 667 proposes changes to TANF work standards, allowing states to enroll up to 10% of their caseload in education or vocational training programs. It also includes provisions for rehabilitative activities for disabled individuals and allows caring for a disabled family member to count as a work activity. The bill aligns with TANF's goal of ending dependency on government benefits and promoting marriage and two-parent families. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose marriage promotion grants using TANF funds, with $100 million for activities like public advertising, education, and skills training. H.R. 240 prioritizes marriage promotion, while S. 667 allocates 80% of funds for this purpose. The bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose marriage promotion grants funded by TANF, with differences in provisions. S. 667 includes consultation with domestic violence organizations, voluntary participation in activities, and prohibits sanctions for non-participation. Both bills also make amendments to TANF provisions. H.R. 240 additionally requires drug testing for TANF applicants and recipients. S. 667 proposes drug testing for TANF applicants and recipients suspected of drug use, with positive tests leading to benefit sanctions. It also includes grants for various special-purpose programs like car purchases, transitional jobs, and domestic violence services. Additionally, the bill allows assistance for teen parents without adult supervision for up to 60 days and provisions for tribal welfare programs. H.R. 240 provides increased funding for tribal work programs and grants tribes $80 million over five years to enhance their capacity to operate TANF programs. It also includes tribal eligibility for TANF contingency and bonus funds, maintaining current funding levels through FY2010.
