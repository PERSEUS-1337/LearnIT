    "content": "The Information Maximization Autoencoder (IMAE) is a novel approach to learning continuous and discrete representations in an unsupervised setting. Unlike the Variational Autoencoder framework, IMAE uses a stochastic encoder to map input data to a hybrid representation, maximizing mutual information. A decoder approximates the posterior distribution of the data, achieving high fidelity by leveraging informative representations. The proposed objective aims to find informative yet compact representations of data through generative latent variable models like the variational autoencoder (VAE). By maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood objective, the model can learn to represent the relationship between data and latent variables effectively. The proposed model aims to maximize the mutual information between data and its representations by using a stochastic encoder. This approach seeks to achieve informative representations for better decoding, in contrast to traditional methods that focus on maximizing ELBO. The proposed model aims to maximize mutual information for better decoding quality and balance between informativeness and independence of latent factors. It introduces a framework for learning both continuous and discrete representations for categorical data, focusing on capturing variations shared across categories. Compared to VAE approaches, the proposed objective offers a more principled way to learn semantically meaningful representations. Our proposed objective offers a more natural and effective approach for learning hybrid representations compared to VAE methods. Beta-VAE is popular for disentangled representations but penalizes mutual information more than standard VAE, leading to underutilization of latent space. Various approaches have been proposed to address Beta-VAE limitations, such as constraining mutual information without specifying a target value, but this can be challenging and result in an invalid lower bound for VAE. The text discusses different approaches to learning disentangled representations in VAE models. One approach involves dropping the mutual information term in ELBO to encourage independence across latent dimensions. Another approach focuses on minimizing the total correlation term of latent representations to promote statistical independence. The proposed information maximization objective combines these ideas by inherently containing the total correlation term while maximizing the informativeness of each representation factor. The paper introduces a new perspective on VAE-based approaches for unsupervised representation learning by maximizing mutual information between data and representations. It combines continuous and discrete representations to model real-world data from different categories effectively. The objective aims to learn compact yet semantically meaningful representations.

It combines continuous and discrete representations to model real-world data effectively. The objective is to learn compact and semantically meaningful representations by optimizing the mutual information between data and its representations. A probabilistic decoder is used to approximate the true posterior, and the dissimilarity between them is minimized by optimizing the KL divergence. The balance between maximizing informativeness of latent representations and maintaining decoding quality is achieved by setting a parameter beta. The paper introduces a new perspective on VAE-based approaches for unsupervised representation learning by maximizing mutual information between data and representations. It combines continuous and discrete representations to model real-world data effectively. The objective is to learn compact and semantically meaningful representations by optimizing the mutual information between data and its representations. The decoding quality is optimized using reparameterization tricks for continuous and discrete representations. The first term in the optimization involves quantifying the informativeness of each representation factor and the statistical dependence between them. Maximize informativeness of each latent factor while promoting statistical independence between continuous factors. In this work, the focus is on optimizing the total correlation term BID4 BID7 using Monte Carlo sampling strategies. Tractable approximations for mutual information between continuous latent factors and data are constructed. The mutual information between a latent factor and data can be maximized by reducing uncertainty and capturing more variance. This can lead to discontinuity in the latent space. The focus is on optimizing the total correlation term using Monte Carlo sampling strategies to maximize mutual information between latent factors and data. Vanishing variance can lead to discontinuity in the latent space, so it is important to control the variance to avoid degenerate solutions. Pushing the latent distribution towards a Gaussian distribution helps achieve a more reasonable trade-off between enlarging the spread of the mean and maintaining continuity. The focus is on optimizing the total correlation term by minimizing the KL divergence between the latent distribution and a Gaussian distribution. The mutual information between a discrete representation and data can be well approximated with a large batch of samples, enabling optimization in a theoretically justifiable way. The empirical estimation of mutual information is a good approximation, allowing for stochastic gradient descent with minibatches of data. Maximizing mutual information I \u03b8 (x; y) helps learn discrete categorical representations by balancing category assignment and categorical identity confidence. The objective involves maximizing I \u03b8 (x; y) while approximating the posterior p \u03b8 (x|y, z) for better latent factor optimization. Weighting the objectives differently can achieve a better balance between information maximization and posterior approximation. The text discusses optimizing latent factors through various methods, including promoting statistically independent factors and formalizing trade-offs for better decoding quality. The objective is to demonstrate that IMAE can successfully learn a hybrid of continuous and discrete representations, outperforming VAE based models. Priors for the representations are chosen as isotropic Gaussian and uniform distributions. Experimental settings are detailed in the appendix. \u03b2-VAE modifies ELBO by increasing the penalty on the KL divergence terms. InfoVAE drops mutual information terms from ELBO. JointVAE controls mutual information by adjusting associated KL divergence terms. The text qualitatively demonstrates that informative representations lead to better interpretability. For continuous representation, high mutual information variables disperse across data samples with low variances. Informative variables uncover intuitive factors of data variation, while non-informative variables show no variation. The same phenomenon is observed for the discrete representation. In this section, quantitative evaluations are performed on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and dSprites BID17 datasets. IMAE achieves better interpretability vs. decoding quality trade-off. A key assumption made is that the conditional distribution p(y|x) for discrete representations should be locally smooth. This assumption is crucial for using neural networks to learn discrete representations. The conditional distribution p(y|x) for discrete representations should be locally smooth to ensure similar data samples are mapped to similar y. Virtual adversarial training (VAT) is crucial for learning interpretable discrete representations, with InfoVAE outperforming \u03b2-VAE in this aspect.\u03b2-VAE sacrifices mutual information I(x; y) and struggles in learning interpretable discrete representations even with VAT. InfoVAE performs better than \u03b2-VAE by dropping I(x; y) from ELBO, achieving good results with distinctive data like MNIST. However, it struggles with less distinctive data like Fashion-MNIST. IMAE can uncover discrete factors over a wide range of \u03b2 values, leading to more interpretable continuous representations. JointVAE outperforms \u03b2-VAE by maximizing I(x; y) towards a target value, but can get stuck in bad local optima. Using large \u03b2 values sacrifices mutual information and leads to less informative representations and poor decoding quality. In contrast, IMAE excels at learning discrete presentations across various \u03b2, \u03b3 values. IMAE is more capable of learning discrete presentations over a wide range of \u03b2, \u03b3 values, resulting in better decoding quality for each category. It consistently performs well with different hyperparameters, especially in regions where decoding quality and informativeness of latent representations are good. The disentanglement capability of IMAE is quantitatively evaluated on dSprites using a metric that measures the gap between the top two empirical mutual information of each latent representation factor and a ground truth factor. The disentanglement score is a weighted average of gaps, indicating how well representation factors are separated. Large \u03b2 values in \u03b2-VAE can penalize mutual information too much, affecting representation usefulness. JointVAE maintains more mutual information with higher \u03b2 values. IMAE shows good trade-off between disentanglement score and decoding quality, especially in regions with good informativeness. Total correlation and disentanglement score have a negative correlation, decreasing with larger \u03b2 values. In the context of disentanglement in representation factors, IMAE achieves a good balance between disentanglement score and decoding quality by seeking statistically independent latent factors. This contrasts with InfoVAE, which prioritizes disentanglement but sacrifices decoding quality and informativeness. Total correlation and disentanglement score have an inverse relationship, with larger \u03b2 values leading to decreased disentanglement. IMA achieves informative representations by maximizing mutual information between data and their representations, inducing semantically meaningful representations while maintaining good decoding quality. It addresses the challenge of unsupervised joint learning of disentangled continuous and discrete representations. However, it may not always be sufficient for representing real data due to assumptions about independent scalar latent factors. The text discusses the need for more structured disentangled representations in machine learning algorithms. It mentions the balance between posterior inference fidelity and information maximization, as well as the decomposition of mutual information between data and its representations. The goal is to encourage group independence in latent factors for better representation of real data. The text discusses the need for structured disentangled representations in machine learning algorithms, balancing posterior inference fidelity and information maximization. It decomposes mutual information between data and representations to encourage group independence in latent factors for better real data representation. The second term in Eq (15) is derived assuming p \u03b8 (b|x) is factorial, while the first term is obtained by substituting equations. Monte Carlo estimator of true probability is denoted by p \u03b8 (y|x n ), and concentration results of entropy H p \u03b8 (y) with respect to empirical distribution p \u03b8 (y) are established. The assumption that p \u03b8 (y), p \u03b8 (y) are bounded below by 1/(CK 2 ) for all y \u2208 C is practical, as true and predicted data distributions are approximately uniform. The text then proceeds to bound the equations. The text discusses the need for structured disentangled representations in machine learning algorithms, balancing posterior inference fidelity and information maximization. Eq (26) and Eq (28) are used to bound the divergence between H \u03b8 (y|x) and H \u03b8 (y|x). By applying [Theorem 2.2.6, BID20], a probability of 1 - 2\u03b4 is established. To scale up the method for large datasets, estimation is proposed based on minibatch data. The entropy H(z) of z is approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. The distribution of variances output by the model is recorded. The distribution of variances output by the encoder is bounded between 0.2 and 2, indicating a limited range of probability densities. The VAE model involves a stochastic decoder and encoder, aiming to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood. Minimizing the KL divergence penalizes the mutual information between variables, impacting the inference task and reconstruction quality. Efforts have been made to revise ELBO to address this issue. IMAE aims to maximize mutual information between data and representations from the start, targeting informative and statistically independent representations. The decoder in IMAE serves as a variational approximation to the true posterior, leading to better quality data reconstruction and generation. IMAE focuses on generating high-quality data by balancing disentanglement score and decoding quality. There is a negative correlation between total correlation and disentanglement score, indicating a decrease in disentanglement score with larger \u03b2 values. Training procedures vary for different datasets, using momentum for MNIST & Fashion MNIST and Adam for dSprites."
