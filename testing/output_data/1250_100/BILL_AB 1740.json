The California Law Fellowship Program offers licensed attorneys and law school graduates limited-term placements in state government positions, with the goal of promoting permanent public-sector employment. The California Law Fellowship Program, administered by The University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, aims to provide post-graduate legal experience and assistance to governmental entities.
