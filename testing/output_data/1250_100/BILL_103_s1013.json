    "content": "The \"Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993\" is cited in this section, which focuses on amending the 1986 Code. It addresses the estate tax treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. The \"Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993\" amends the 1986 Code to address estate tax treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. If the executor elects, the value of such land can be excluded from the gross estate. The Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993 amends the 1986 Code to exclude the value of land under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes if certain conditions are met. This includes land owned by the decedent or their family for at least 3 years and with a qualified conservation contribution made on a qualified real property interest. The Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993 amends the 1986 Code to exclude the value of land under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the donor retained any development right when the qualified conservation contribution was made, an additional estate tax is imposed on the first person disposing of the property after the decedent's death. The additional estate tax imposed on the first person disposing of property after the decedent's death is based on the increase in estate tax liability if the value of the development right had been included in the gross estate. If only a portion of the property is disposed of, a pro rata portion of the tax is due, with subsequent dispositions reducing the tax. The tax is payable by the person disposing of the property. The tax on the development right must be paid by the person disposing of the property by April 15 of the following year. The term 'development right' refers to the right to use the land for commercial purposes not directly supportive of conservation or for activities like farming and recreation. The election for land under a qualified conservation easement must be made on the estate tax return and is irrevocable. The executor must calculate the additional estate tax and file a Notice of Potential Estate Tax Due in the public record where the land is located. The filing must be done as prescribed by the Secretary. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding basis of property acquired from a decedent apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, including land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after that date. SEC. 3. Gift tax on land with a qualified conservation easement. Gift Tax With Respect to Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement: An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a provision where the transfer of land with a qualified conservation easement may not be considered a gift for tax purposes, upon the donor's election. If the donor retains any development rights, an additional gift tax is imposed. An additional gift tax is imposed on the person disposing of property after the gift date, equal to the increase in gift tax liability if the development right had been treated as a gift. Definitions and rules apply, with the donor substituted for the executor. The amendments made by this section apply to gifts of land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1992. SEC. 4 amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for qualified conservation contributions where surface and mineral rights are separated. It states that if the probability of surface mining on the property is remote, it qualifies as a contribution. SEC. 5 clarifies that a qualified conservation contribution is not considered a disposition. Qualified conservation contributions by gift or otherwise, as defined in section 170(h), are not considered a disposition for tax purposes under section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, land subject to a qualified conservation easement, as defined in section 2031(c), does not disqualify the property as qualified real property. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, with land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after the same date."
