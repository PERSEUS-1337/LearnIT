    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public School Redefinition Act of 1993\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of improving educational services for all citizens, especially disadvantaged individuals, to enhance national and economic security. Fundamental reform is necessary in the educational system to unleash the potential of teachers, students, parents, and communities. Market competition and choice can drive reform, but more educational options are needed for all students, including those who are disadvantaged. Local educational agencies' monopoly on creating new public schools has limited choices for parents and students. Public education should focus on outcomes that serve the public interest. The public education system should focus on requirements that protect and promote the public interest, not just through ownership or control of facilities by local educational agencies or public agencies. The purpose of this Act is to encourage states to establish new and more effective public schools, provide federal assistance and flexibility for this purpose, and set criteria for establishing such schools. The Act defines terms like \"eligible partnership\" as a partnership between a sponsor and a charter public school, \"local educational agency\" as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"charter public school\" as a nonsectarian school providing comprehensive instruction from kindergarten to twelfth grade without charging tuition. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like \"Secretary,\" \"sponsor,\" and \"State educational agency,\" as well as requirements for charter schools such as admission by lottery, financial audits, and compliance with health and safety regulations. The curr_chunk states \"SEC. 5. PROGRAM AUTHORITY.\" The Secretary is authorized to award grants to State educational agencies for charter public school programs. Grants can also be awarded to charter public schools in States that choose not to participate. Grant funds are to be used for planning and implementing charter public schools. Charter public schools receiving grants must use funds to plan and implement schools. State educational agencies can reserve up to 5% of grant funds for administrative expenses. Schools can receive grants for up to 3 years and must provide matching funds. Grants must benefit students in urban and rural areas. The Secretary ensures grants are used for construction, renovation, and repair. Grant funds awarded under this Act cannot be used for construction, major renovation, or repair of facilities. However, they can be used for planning, equipment purchases, and minor renovation to meet health and safety requirements. SEC. 6. APPLICATION. Each State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary to receive a grant under this Act. The application should describe the objectives of the charter public school program, steps taken to inform teachers, parents, and communities, and assurances of obtaining waivers for applicable statutes and regulations. The application for a grant under this Act must include details on hindrances to establishing charter public schools, outcomes in partnership agreements, meeting charter school definitions, student outcomes, progress measurement, and involvement of teachers, parents, and community members. Each charter public school must involve teachers, parents, and community members in planning and implementation. To apply for a grant, the school must submit an application with required information and assurances to the Secretary. Charter public schools must enter into an outcomes agreement with their sponsor to receive a grant under this Act. The agreement must outline the outcomes the school aims to achieve and include specific information and assurances. Schools receiving grants will be eligible for various forms of funding, and there are provisions for termination. SEC. 9. TERMINATION. Grant payments will be terminated if a charter public school is not making acceptable progress towards meeting specified outcomes.\n\nSEC. 10. REPORTS. Charter public schools must report annually to the State educational agency on their progress in meeting outcomes. The State educational agency must then report to the Secretary. Additionally, schools receiving grants must report annually to the Secretary on their progress.\n\nSEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and additional funds for the following 3 years to implement the Act."
