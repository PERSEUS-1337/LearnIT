    "content": "During the Vietnam War, Operation Ranch Hand sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic carcinogen. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in areas like Bien Hoa, Danang, and the A Luoi Valley. The environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange have prompted recent U.S. responses. The U.S. response to environmental damage and health problems caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam has helped advance bilateral relations. President Obama pledged continued support in addressing the legacy of war, including removing landmines and cleaning up dioxin contamination at Danang Airport and Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration has also committed to assisting Vietnam with the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. The U.S. and Vietnam have been working together to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. Efforts include dioxin remediation at Da Nang Airport and Bien Hoa Airport, as well as the removal of unexploded ordnances. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas of Vietnam. The U.S. Congress has allocated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, with more funds typically allocated for remediation. The actual amount available for assistance may be less due to regulations. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup. Funds allocated for health and disability programs under the Development Assistance account have been used for disability support programs in Danang and other parts of Vietnam. Environmental remediation efforts focused on Danang airport have been completed, with joint dioxin removal operations planned for Bien Hoa airbase. Discussions are ongoing between U.S. and Vietnamese officials regarding health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure. State Department and USAID, along with Vietnamese ministries and agencies, administer the programs funded by the appropriated funds. The Vietnamese government established Office 33 to oversee Agent Orange and dioxin issues, involving various ministries. Congressional interest focuses on allocating funds for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas, as well as overseeing fund usage by State Department and USAID. The 110th and 111th Congress appropriated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin cleanup and health programs in Vietnam. The State Department designated USAID to handle the $3 million for dioxin remediation, setting a precedent for future appropriations. In total, $18 million was allocated for cleanup and health services. In subsequent appropriations acts, Congress allocated additional funds for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam, including $12 million for remediation at Danang Airport in 2010. The State Department and USAID also provided $1.9 million for environmental remediation at the airport in FY2010. Additionally, there were efforts to develop a comprehensive plan for ongoing remediation efforts. The 113th Congress allocated funds for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam, including environmental remediation and health services. Appropriations were renewed for FY2013 and FY2014, with $22.0 million for remediation and $7.0 million for health programs. Funds under the Economic Support Fund were also designated for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam. Funds allocated for Vietnam health/disability programs and environmental remediation of dioxin contaminated sites. Specifically, $7.5 million for health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation in Vietnam. The report allocated $7 million for health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin contamination in Vietnam. The funds are intended to address the needs of individuals with severe mobility impairment and cognitive disabilities. Additionally, $20 million was designated for dioxin remediation activities in Vietnam, with a focus on minimizing administrative costs and maximizing impact through Vietnamese organizations. The Act allocates not less than $10 million for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination in Vietnam. This includes assistance for individuals with severe mobility impairment and cognitive disabilities. Additionally, the Act allows for funding to be provided to the Government of Vietnam for remediation activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for health and disability programs in Vietnam for individuals affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. USAID is responsible for distributing the funds for environmental remediation projects. $127 million was allocated for environmental remediation projects from FY2011-FY2017, and 63.5% of the $44.3 million for health- and disability-related services. USAID has obligated $20.3 million out of $21 million for these services from FY2007-FY2011. Congress has raised concerns about the pace and types of programs funded for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam. The appropriations for health programs in communities near contaminated sites in Vietnam have varied over the years, with funds allocated for environmental remediation and disability support programs. Concerns have been raised about the pace and types of programs funded for health and disability services in these areas. USAID's three-year program in Vietnam aimed to improve the lives of persons with disabilities, with a shift to smaller direct program funding for health and disability services. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, has faced delays and rising costs since 2008. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, faced delays and rising costs. The decontamination was completed in August 2017, with the project's estimated completion date extended to March 31, 2017. The amount of material to be decontaminated increased from 61,700 cubic meters to approximately 90,000 cubic meters, with an additional 60,000 cubic meters of \"lower risk material.\" The estimated cost of the project rose from $33.7 million to over $110 million. The MOU between USAID and Office 33 allocated $6.0 million for environmental health programs in Danang, including a grant for dioxin containment at Danang airport. An Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption for decontamination, estimating a cost of $33.7 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent to start the remediation project in 2011 and complete it by 2013. In October 2013, the Danang airport remediation project was approved by the Prime Minister and the Ministry of National Defence. USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for environmental remediation using in-pile thermal desorption. Onsite work began in August 2012. An internal audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project, with some reflecting work beyond FY2013. The thermal desorption of contaminated soil at Danang airport was done in two phases, treating approximately 45,000 m3 of soil. Phase 1 started in April 2014 and Phase 2 began in January 2015. Progress was delayed by factors like weather and additional soil requiring decontamination. The project was completed in August 2017. The secondary treatment facility at Danang Airport was shut down in July 2014 to change the filtering system, causing delays in raising the soil temperature to the target level. An internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 highlighted potential risks, including weather-related issues and soil cooling problems. The audit recommended implementing a formal risk management plan, more training for Vietnamese officials, and better data documentation procedures. The project was completed in November 2018, with both governments holding a ceremony to mark its completion. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected by USAID due to underestimating the contamination. USAID has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of disability, starting in 1989. Between FY2007 and FY2010, the State Department and USAID utilized funds for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. A 2010 USAID assessment noted accomplishments but mentioned the short timeframe for meeting objectives. In 2012, a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program was approved to build on previous assistance in Danang and include public health activities. The project focused on providing assistance to persons with disabilities in Danang and other high-need areas in Vietnam. Funding for the program was initially set at $9 million, with grants awarded to local partners for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. The program expanded to provinces heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. USAID provided nearly US$900,000 in grants to 14 local partners and organizations in provinces heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. The assistance aims to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life for persons with disabilities. USAID will also provide therapies and training in high-prevalence and poverty areas like Binh Dinh province. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue have been identified as heavily sprayed areas. USAID, in consultation with Vietnamese agencies, will administer a new approach for environmental cleanup. The Bien Hoa airbase, a dioxin \"hot spot\" with high contamination levels, is being considered for cleanup similar to Danang airport. The Vietnamese government has taken mitigation measures at Bien Hoa, including a passive landfill for contaminated soil. A study by Hatfield Consultants found multiple dioxin \"hot spots\" at Bien Hoa airbase, with contaminated soil spreading into nearby water sources. UNDP, Office 33, and MONRE have been working on a dioxin remediation plan for five years, estimating 250,000 m3 of soil needing treatment at a cost of $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to assess remediation options, with the final report released in May 2016. The final environmental assessment report released by USAID in May 2016 determined that there are 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments at or near Bien Hoa Airbase. Five treatment methods were considered, with estimated costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. Over $3.7 million has been spent on assessing environmental remediation. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence announced infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa airport in September 2017, with a budget of $11.8 million. The USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent in January 2018 to decontaminate Bien Hoa airport. A $183 million nonrefundable aid agreement was signed in May 2018 for the project, which is estimated to cost $390 million and take 10 years. Approximately 500,000 cubic meters of soil are to be decontaminated, with a decontamination factory to be constructed by the Japanese general contractor, Shimizu Corporation, at the airport. The decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport, constructed by Shimizu Corporation, will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate 40 tons of soil per hour. The technique is cost-effective compared to thermal desorption used at Danang airport. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site, expressing America's commitment to remediate past issues. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam focuses on providing assistance for environmental damage and oversight of aid utilization. The State Department and USAID have been involved in environmental remediation projects in Vietnam, with support from both the Obama and Trump administrations. Congress has provided funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, which has been used for various disability programs near Agent Orange affected areas. President Obama's budget requests did not explicitly mention health and disability assistance for Agent Orange contaminated areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical care, vocational training, and equipment. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance for Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical care, vocational training, and housing repairs. The Act also requires support for research on health issues related to Agent Orange, assistance to healthcare institutions in Vietnam, and remediation of areas with high levels of Agent Orange contamination. Section 8 of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 mandates quarterly reports from relevant government departments on the implementation of the Act. Congress oversees funding allocation for environmental remediation and health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas in Vietnam, focusing on cost concerns at Danang airport and the pace of health service provision by USAID. The cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million to $116 million, leading to concerns about cost overruns. USAID has struggled to effectively utilize funds for health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas, with only 63.5% of funds from FY2011 to FY2017 being obligated. There have been shifts in USAID's approach to administering these funds, raising questions about the effectiveness of their efforts. Some observers question the effectiveness of health services funds allocated by USAID for Vietnam, reflecting congressional dissatisfaction with fund management. Congress has appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability services in Vietnam, with specific amounts usually detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
