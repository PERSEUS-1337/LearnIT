    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drivers Accelerated Interest Deductibility Act of 2010\" or the \"Drivers AID Act\". Congress finds that the economic health of the United States relies on a strong automotive industry, historically accounting for 20% of retail spending. Automotive sales peaked in 2006-2008 but have since declined, with sales averaging less than 10 million units annually. The automotive new vehicle dealers industry in the United States made significant contributions to the national economy in 2008. With approximately 20,000 dealers, the total sales reached $576 billion, accounting for 14.6% of total retail sales. Employing 1,057,500 people, the industry generated a national payroll of over $52 billion. Maintaining a financially stable dealer network is crucial for the success of automobile manufacturers and benefits the overall economic interest of the country. The reduction in the cost of capital needed to finance new vehicle purchases will benefit the automotive dealer industry, strengthening the national economy. Nonmortgage interest payments, like automobile loan debt, were deductible for Federal income tax until 1986. The deduction for interest on indebtedness incurred to acquire a passenger car or light truck was eliminated in 1986. The amendment to section 163(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new subparagraph (G) regarding qualified vehicle interest for vehicles acquired when the national unemployment rate is at least 7 percent. The definition of qualified vehicle interest is also revised to include interest on debt incurred to acquire a qualified vehicle. The amendment to section 163(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new subparagraph (G) for qualified vehicle interest on vehicles acquired during high unemployment. Qualified vehicle interest includes interest on debt for a motor vehicle used by the taxpayer, subject to a $5,000 limit and a 36-month period restriction. The new subparagraph (G) defines a qualified motor vehicle as one acquired by the taxpayer for personal use, made by a manufacturer, with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,000 pounds or less, and classified as a passenger automobile or light truck. A \"vehicle\" is defined as a vehicle primarily for public road use with at least 4 wheels. Terms like \"automobile\" and \"manufacturer\" are defined by the EPA. The average national unemployment rate is calculated based on monthly rates in a calendar quarter. The deduction for qualified vehicle interest, as per section 163(h)(5), is allowed in computing adjusted gross income. These amendments apply to vehicles acquired on or after January 1, 2008."
