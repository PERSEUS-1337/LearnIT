Over 250,000 men and women served in the Merchant Marine during World War II. During World War II, the United States Merchant Marine faced dangers from submarines, mines, armed raiders, destroyers, aircraft, and kamikaze pilots. Over 6,830 members were killed at sea, 11,000 were wounded, and 604 were taken prisoner. 1 in 32 members died in the line of duty, the highest percentage among all U.S. armed services. The Merchant Marine continues to serve the U.S. and uphold the ideals of its former members. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds for the American Merchant Marine Veterans Memorial.
