    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Preservation Act\". It includes findings related to the preservation of the Great Lakes. Congress finds that the Great Lakes are crucial public natural resources, containing 1/5 of the world's fresh water supply and providing safe drinking water for millions. The Great Lakes are vital for the economies of the region and are managed under the Great Lakes Charter of 1985. The Great Lakes are important public natural resources, providing safe drinking water and supporting regional economies. Decision-making regarding Great Lakes water should remain with the Governors of the Great Lakes States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. \"Bulk fresh water\" is fresh water extracted for transportation without further processing. \"From the Great Lakes basin\" refers to water from specific lakes, interconnecting waterways, or tributaries. The term \"Great Lake\" includes Lake Erie and Lake Huron. The term \"Great Lakes Province\" refers to Ontario or Quebec, Canada, while \"Great Lakes State\" includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin. The \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service. SEC. 4. MORATORIUM ON EXPORT OF BULK FRESH WATER. Bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes basin shall not be exported from the United States. This provision will end when an approved mechanism for water decisions is in place. Congress suggests a U.S.-Canada agreement to uphold the moratorium. SEC. 5. PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC GREAT LAKES LIGHTHOUSES. Congress finds that the Great Lakes have greatly influenced settlement, commerce, transportation, industry, and recreation in the Great Lakes States. Lighthouses in the region have played a crucial role in guiding mariners and hold historical or architectural significance. However, many lighthouses are in poor condition due to neglect. The Secretary is required to conduct a study within 3 years to identify options for preserving these lighthouses. The National Park Service will determine the best way to preserve lighthouses and their associated resources. They will consult with State and local historical associations, historic preservation agencies, the Coast Guard Commandant, and other relevant entities. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose."
