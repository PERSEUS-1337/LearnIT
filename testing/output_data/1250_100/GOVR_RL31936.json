    "content": "The report provides a history and analysis of general revenue sharing (GRS), a federal program that provided transfers to state and local governments without specific spending requirements. Congress considered reviving the GRS program in 2003 and 2004 to address budget shortfalls. Observers suggest a new GRS program could prevent state spending cuts and tax increases in 2009. The budget gaps for FY2009 and FY2010 are estimated at $31.0 billion and $64.7 billion, respectively. Looking at the past GRS program from 1972 to 1986 could offer insights for policymakers considering a revised program in 2009. General revenue sharing (GRS) is federal grants to state and local governments for spending flexibility, created by the 1972 Act. The program transferred over $83 billion from 1972 to 1986. A new GRS program could prevent state budget shortfalls in 2009, with estimated distribution to states based on the original formula. The General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program provided federal grants to state and local governments, totaling over $83 billion from 1972 to 1986. To match this level of assistance today, approximately $313 billion would need to be distributed over the next 15 years. GRS grants were allocated based on a formula considering tax effort, population, and per capita income, with payments following the budget calendars of governments. After 1980, only local governments were entitled to GRS grants. The General Revenue Sharing (GRS) program distributed federal grants to state and local governments based on a three-part formula considering tax effort, population, and per capita income. The formula included the relative income factor (RIF) and general tax effort factor (GTEF) to adjust state allocations based on ability-to-pay and tax structure. States with higher RIF received a greater share of revenue. The GRS formula allocated federal grants to state and local governments based on tax effort, population, and per capita income. The GTEF component discouraged states from reducing taxes and relying more on federal revenue. The allocation procedure distributed one-third of the total amount to state government and two-thirds to local general purpose governments, which were further distributed to county areas. The formula was criticized for generating inequitable treatment of local governments. The GRS formula allocated federal grants based on tax effort, population, and per capita income. Critics argued that it led to inequitable treatment of local governments due to tiering allocation procedures. The rationale behind GRS evolved over time, with proponents and opponents modifying their arguments based on changing economic and political conditions. The report discusses three economic rationales for GRS: fiscal reallocation, addressing government liquidity crises, and synchronizing federal and state-local fiscal policy. Fiscal reallocation involves replacing state and local tax regimes with federal taxes and shifting spending decisions to state and local governments. Proponents argue for a more progressive tax structure, but the effectiveness of GRS in achieving this goal is uncertain. The shift in spending decisions is based on the belief that state and local governments can better understand and meet the preferences of their residents. Fiscal reallocation through GRS could address the assignment issue and improve spending efficiency for local governments. Arguments for and against GRS are subjective, focusing on fairness in the tax system. The impact of fiscal reallocation on government fiscal relationships and the desirability of such a shift are not analyzed in the report. Local governments often face fiscal liquidity problems. Local governments often face fiscal liquidity problems due to revenue fluctuations, leading to budget deficits. State and local governments cannot use debt to close deficits, unlike the federal government. A countercyclical GRS program could help alleviate short-term liquidity issues for states. Opponents argue that poor fiscal management is the cause of deficit problems. Saving surplus revenue during economic expansions could help cover revenue shortfalls during economic contractions, but research shows this may not always be sufficient. State and local governments tend to save less during economic expansions due to political pressure to reduce taxes. The federal government uses countercyclical fiscal policy to stabilize the economy through tax reductions or increased spending, stimulating demand for goods and services to promote economic recovery. During economic downturns, state and local governments may counteract federal countercyclical fiscal policy by raising taxes and cutting expenditures, potentially undermining federal stimulus efforts. The 1973-1975 recession, deeper and longer than current economic conditions, saw a similar debate on countercyclical aid to states. Senator Muskie highlighted the delay in federal tax cuts' impact due to state tax increases. The analysis considers how General Revenue Sharing (GRS) could impact the economy if implemented in 2009. The analysis considers how General Revenue Sharing (GRS) could impact the economy if implemented in 2009. It discusses the potential size of GRS compared to state deficits, implementation issues, and the question of whether state actions without federal assistance would dampen the effect of federal fiscal policy. Closing the remaining state FY2009 budget gaps with revenue sharing would likely have little effect on the national economy, as the gaps are a small percentage of the U.S. GDP. The projected shortfalls for FY2010 are also noted. The estimated FY2009 fiscal imbalance of $31 billion was closed by some states, avoiding anticipated state spending cuts and tax increases for FY2010 of $64.7 billion. This could provide significant fiscal stimulus if states spent federal grants immediately. However, research shows that only a portion of lump sum transfers is translated into new spending, as states may adjust own-source tax revenue in response to federal grants. The flow of federal spending through states to designated programs may be hindered by state government administration and individual state processes. The implementation of fiscal stimulus by state governments may be hindered by time lags, potentially leading to mistimed actions. Policy makers must carefully consider the timing of fiscal stimulus to avoid pro-cyclical and inflationary effects. GRS grants may face delays at the federal level in determining the need and size of the stimulus, as well as in allocating the grants equitably among jurisdictions. The allocation of federal grants for fiscal stimulus faces challenges in balancing equity among states and providing optimal stimulus. Delays in determining the allocation scheme and receiving grants at the state level could impact the effectiveness of the stimulus. States have options for using federal grants to increase government spending. The most stimulative option for states to use federal grants is to increase government spending, which injects money into the economy immediately. This would help retain state employees, maintain operations, and prevent cutbacks in social programs like education and healthcare. The effectiveness of this fiscal stimulus depends on the multiplier effect, where each dollar spent is circulated back into the economy. To achieve the greatest stimulus, states should avoid contractionary actions like furloughing workers. For FY2009, the NCSL asked states to categorize spending strategies to reduce budget gaps. Changes in taxes were not included. For FY2010, some state and local governments may increase taxes to close budget gaps. The most effective spending option for states would be to avoid net job losses, as layoffs reduce aggregate demand. Federal spending can help retain state employees and stimulate the economy. The federal government's spending can help retain state employees and stimulate the economy by preventing net job losses. This would avoid negative effects on the economy and enhance the stimulative effect of avoiding job losses, especially for low-income workers. The stimulative effect of avoiding across-the-board cuts in spending programs, local aid, and tax increases varies by state. Tax cuts are less stimulative than direct spending increases. Debt reduction and contributing to a rainy day fund offer little stimulus in the short run. Federal grants used to avoid tapping into tobacco revenue have a similar saving effect. The State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 authorized unconditional GRS grants for state and local governments. These grants had priority expenditures for public safety and environmental protection. The stimulative effect of federal grants on state and local governments' fiscal stimulus is uncertain, as not all funds may be used for stimulative purposes. The 1972 State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act authorized GRS grants for state and local governments for specific expenditures, including public safety, environmental protection, public transportation, health, recreation, libraries, social services for the poor or aged, and financial administration. The grants could not be used for education and had restrictions on matching federal grants. The Act aimed to reallocate government responsibilities due to changing citizen demands for services. The Nixon Administration signed the legislation for the GRS program to address increasing public service needs and rising costs. The program aimed to decentralize government, stabilize or reduce state and local taxes, equalize fiscal conditions between rich and poor states, and shift reliance from property and sales taxes to income taxation. It also aimed to counteract cyclical economic problems like state and local budget deficits. The 1976 Extension of the GRS program aimed to address state and local budget deficits caused by economic slowdowns. Policymakers recognized the countercyclical potential of revenue sharing during the recession from 1973 to 1975. The extension was justified by rising service costs, declining tax bases, and the mismatch between public service demand and revenue availability. Congress aimed to stabilize state and local governments' fiscal problems through the GRS program. The 1976 extension of the GRS program aimed to solve fiscal problems for state and local governments and stabilize the economy. It eliminated spending restrictions and allowed flexibility in the use of grants. The extension, totaling $25.5 billion, was approximately 2.5% of total state and local own-source tax revenue collected over a four-year period. The ultimate purpose of revenue sharing was seen as a long-term restructuring of intergovernmental transfers. The countercyclical fiscal policy aspect was not directly addressed, but the ability of revenue sharing to \"stabilize\" the economy was acknowledged. The 1980 Extension of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act Amendments reduced GRS grants by one-third, from $6.850 billion to $4.567 billion, and only local governments received the grants. It also authorized a \"countercyclical assistance program\" to provide assistance to state and local governments during recessions, with $1 billion authorized for each fiscal year from 1981 to 1983. The countercyclical assistance program authorized $1 billion for each fiscal year from 1981 to 1983 to provide funds during recessions triggered by consecutive declines in real gross national product and real wages and salaries. Funds would be allocated based on the severity of the recession, with a limit of $300 million per quarter. Funds would be split between state governments and county areas, with adjustments based on the economic downturn severity and state tax effort. 1% of funds would be set aside for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. The countercyclical fiscal assistance program authorized $1 billion annually from 1981 to 1983 to provide funds during recessions triggered by consecutive declines in real GNP and wages. However, no grants were provided as the trigger threshold was never crossed. The 1980 Act discontinued revenue sharing for states and introduced countercyclical fiscal assistance through federal grants, which was never funded. Local governments generated $593.8 billion in own source revenue over the three fiscal years covered by the Act. The 1980 Act provided $593.8 billion in own-source revenue over three fiscal years. GRS granted $13.7 billion to local governments, representing 2.3% of total revenue. The grants had minimal impact on the national economy, amounting to 0.14% of U.S. GDP. The $1 billion countercyclical aid for 1981-1983 was never spent. The 1983 Extension aimed to stabilize local government finances. The Committee amendment extends the general revenue sharing program for three years, providing $13.7 billion to local governments in three equal annual installments. The countercyclical aid program was not extended, and the GRS program ended on September 30, 1986."
