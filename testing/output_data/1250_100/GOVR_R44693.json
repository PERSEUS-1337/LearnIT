    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or the employee's own health condition. Eligible employees may also receive up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered military servicemember. Employees must meet certain criteria to be eligible for FMLA leave. The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons, including caring for a family member with a serious health condition. Eligible employees must have 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to the start of leave, work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and have worked for the employer for 12 months. The FMLA also applies to public agencies and has been amended multiple times since its passage in 1993. Several proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to amend the FMLA by creating new entitlements, expanding permissible leave categories, and modifying employee eligibility requirements. Currently, eligible employees are entitled to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave for family and medical needs and 26 workweeks to care for a seriously ill or injured servicemember. Two bills proposed additional leave entitlements for parental involvement and family wellness purposes, with differences in the amount of leave allowed. H.R. 5535 proposed parental involvement leave, allowing eligible employees up to 48 hours of leave per year to attend school conferences or activities of their child or grandchild. Notification to employers at least seven days in advance was required. This is different from FMLA leave for other reasons like caring for a new child or serious health conditions. The 114th Congress considered expanding qualifying uses of FMLA leave, including bereavement, domestic violence needs, family involvement, and medical needs for veterans. Proposed bills would have allowed FMLA leave for the death of a son or daughter, parent, or sibling, but not for the death of a spouse. S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlement to address domestic violence, family involvement, and medical needs for veterans. It would have allowed employees to use the 12-workweek entitlement for various purposes, including school-related activities, medical appointments for family members, and hospital care. The proposed expansion of FMLA leave entitlement under S. 473 would have allowed employees to use the current 12-workweek entitlement for hospital care or medical services related to a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher. It also aimed to broaden the set of family members for whom an employee may take family leave and amend definitions related to the current entitlement, including leave for the arrival of a new child or for a family member's serious health condition. The FMLA leave entitlement may be used for a serious health condition of the employee's family members or for military exigency and caregiver leave. Proposed legislative changes would expand FMLA leave for caregiving purposes to include domestic partners' children, adult children, grandchildren, and adult grandchildren. The proposed legislative changes would expand FMLA leave to include domestic partners' children, adult children, grandchildren, and adult grandchildren, as well as other family members for various caregiving purposes. H.R. 5701, S. 473, and H.R. 5519 proposed expanding FMLA leave to include additional family members like adult children, grandchildren, and domestic partners' children. The 114th Congress considered legislation to broaden FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by amending definitions of son or daughter and serious health condition. The proposed legislation aimed to expand FMLA leave to include adult children and children of domestic partners. The definition of serious health condition would also be amended to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation. H.R. 4616 would not consider recovery alone as a serious health condition for FMLA leave eligibility. The 114th Congress considered proposals to amend general eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, including reducing the minimum number of employees required within 75 miles of an employee's worksite and amending the hours-of-service requirement. H.R. 5165 proposed new eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities to access FMLA-protected leave without meeting the standard 12 months and 1,250 hours of employment requirement. Veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30%-50% would be eligible for leave after 8 months of employment and at least 833 hours worked in the previous 8 months. A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 60% or higher would be eligible to use leave for medical care related to his or her disability if employed for 6 months and at least 625 hours in the previous 6-month period. Certification from a VA medical provider or approved non-VA facility is required for disabilities rated at 30% or higher. Veterans retired from the Armed Forces due to a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher are also eligible for medical care leave. Employees with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher can use leave for medical care if employed for 8 months and at least 833 hours in the previous 8-month period. Veterans with a disability rated at 60% or higher can access this leave after 6 months and 625 hours of employment. Certification from the Department of Defense is required for retirees with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher. This separate eligibility requirement allows veterans to access FMLA leave sooner and facilitates their use of this leave year-to-year. S. 3444 proposed separate hours-of-service requirements for educational support professionals (ESP) in public schools or institutions of higher education. ESPs would need to meet specific criteria for eligibility, including working a minimum number of hours per month or a percentage of total monthly hours. The bill also allowed the Secretary of Labor to establish rules for calculating leave entitlement for ESPs without changing the overall entitlement available to them."
