    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates campaign contributions in federal elections by defining contributions as money or anything of value given to influence an election. Contributions are distinguished from expenditures, which involve spending money directly for advocacy. FECA establishes limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements for contributions. It also prohibits contributions made in the name of another person to prevent circumvention of contribution limits. Federal campaign finance law, under the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), prohibits circumventing contribution limits by giving money to someone else to contribute to a candidate. The Supreme Court upholds reasonable limits on contributions to prevent quid pro quo corruption. Source restrictions in federal campaign finance law ban contributions from corporations and labor unions from their general treasuries. Candidates can accept contributions from separate segregated funds or political action committees (PACs) established by these entities. The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 invalidated the federal ban on corporate treasury contributions. The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits circumventing contribution limits by giving money to someone else to contribute to a candidate. While Citizens United v. FEC invalidated the federal ban on corporate treasury funding of independent expenditures, it did not affect the ban on corporate contributions to candidates and parties. Another restriction is the \"pay-to-play\" prohibition, which bans federal candidates from accepting contributions from federal government contractors. This prohibition applies during contract negotiations and performance, including assets of partnerships and individuals who are federal contractors. The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits circumventing contribution limits by giving money to someone else to contribute to a candidate. The ban on corporate contributions to candidates and parties remains in place despite Citizens United v. FEC. Federal candidates are prohibited from accepting contributions from federal government contractors to prevent quid pro quo corruption. The ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2015, citing government interests in preventing corruption and maintaining merit-based administration. The ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2015, citing government interests in preventing corruption and maintaining merit-based administration. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to the ruling in January 2016. Pay-to-play corruption involves businesses making campaign contributions to secure government contracts or benefits, often seen at the state and local level facilitated by a complicit political culture. Since 1940, federal contractors have been prohibited from making campaign contributions to federal candidates, parties, or committees to prevent pay-to-play corruption. The D.C. Circuit noted in 2015 that there have been few instances of corruption at the federal level due to this prohibition. Federal contracting emphasizes competitive procedures unlike some state practices. Federal contracting regulations stress competitive vendor selection and aim to protect the process from political influences. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits candidates from accepting contributions from foreign nationals, except lawful permanent residents. Foreign nationals are also barred from participating in U.S. election decision-making processes. The FEC provides guidance on compliance, allowing U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations to establish PACs as long as no foreign financing is involved and no foreign nationals are involved in PAC operations. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits foreign nationals from participating in U.S. election decision-making processes. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of disclosure requirements for candidate campaign committees to promote transparency and accountability in the electoral process. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates contributions, including limits on coordinated communications with candidates or parties. Independent expenditures, not coordinated with candidates, are unlimited under Supreme Court precedent. Citizens United allows corporations and unions to make unlimited independent expenditures. The regulations establish criteria for determining when a communication by an organization is considered coordinated with a candidate or party and treated as a contribution. The standards include \"content\" and \"conduct\" requirements, with the \"content\" standard focusing on the subject and timing of the communication, while the \"conduct\" standard addresses interactions between the organization and the candidate or party. Express advocacy is not necessary for a communication to be considered coordinated. FECA prohibits the conversion of campaign funds for personal use, defining it as using funds for expenses unrelated to the campaign or duties as a federal officeholder. This includes expenses like home mortgage, clothing purchases, and entertainment. Violations involving $25,000 or more per year can result in fines or imprisonment under Title 18 of the United States Code. FECA imposes penalties for violations, including fines or imprisonment under Title 18 of the United States Code. Penalties vary based on the amount involved, with fines or imprisonment for different durations. The U.S. Department of Justice typically handles criminal prosecutions, but the FEC can also refer cases for prosecution under certain circumstances. The FEC may refer willful violations of campaign finance laws or political corruption provisions to the U.S. Attorney General. These laws penalize both contributors and officials for unlawful contributions and influence on official acts. Bribery is a well-known political corruption crime that prohibits officials from accepting things of value in exchange for being influenced in their official duties. The prohibition on illegal gratuities and extortion in exchange for official acts is a lesser included offense of bribery. The scope of honest services fraud is limited to situations involving bribery or kickbacks that deprive the public of expected services from government officials. Federal law prohibits public officials from receiving private benefits for actions taken in their official capacity. The federal bribery statute criminalizes corrupt demands for anything of value in return for being influenced in official acts. Campaign contributions to federal candidates could be considered bribes if certain elements are present. Key issues include defining public officials, establishing corrupt agreements, and determining what constitutes an official act. The federal bribery statute prohibits bribery involving public officials, including Members of Congress, officers or employees of the United States, and individuals selected to be public officials. Unlike other criminal provisions, bribery requires a specific intent to be shown, involving a corrupt agreement or quid pro quo. The bribe must be the prime mover of the official act performed. Bribery involving public officials requires a corrupt agreement or quid pro quo, with the bribe being the prime mover of the official act. The agreement does not need to be explicitly stated but must be proven to link the motivation for the act to the contribution. Contributions made for a favorable relationship without an agreement are not considered bribes. Campaign contributions to candidates for public office are not considered bribes unless there is a corrupt bargain or quid pro quo arrangement. The nature of campaign contributions implies a relationship where the donor expects the candidate to act in their interests. Without this corrupt agreement, contributions given in support or appreciation for official positions are not considered bribes. Campaign contributions to candidates for public office are associated with an expectation of reciprocity, but lawful contributions do not create overriding obligations. The bribery statute requires a thing of value to be received in return for being influenced in an official act, which includes decisions or actions on governmental matters pending before a public official. The term \"official act\" is broadly interpreted to encompass actions within an official's capacity, but there must be some impact on a governmental matter pending or to be brought before the official. In the context of campaign contributions and bribery statutes, the term \"official act\" is broadly defined as actions that impact governmental matters pending before a public official. This could include recommending policies, intervening on behalf of private parties, or securing access for contributors. Merely meeting with constituents or private individuals may not constitute an official act unless specific decisions or duties are involved. In the context of campaign contributions and bribery statutes, the term \"official act\" is broadly defined as actions that impact governmental matters pending before a public official. The Department of Justice has clarified that granting access in exchange for political contributions may not constitute an official act for bribery or extortion prosecution. Courts have ruled that providing access to present views or showing deference to generous contributors does not necessarily imply an intent to improperly influence official duties. Offering special access to contributors is seen as a common practice in political fundraising, described as an \"access\" payment permitted in the private funding of campaigns. The court in Carpenter noted that granting or denying access to elected officials based on contributions is not criminalized, as it is considered unavoidable in privately funded election campaigns. Elected officials commonly consider campaign contributions when deciding how to ration their time, although this may offend principles of equal representation and fairness. The Supreme Court clarified in McDonnell v. United States that arranging meetings with public officials may not constitute official acts for bribery and corruption statutes. In McDonnell v. United States, the Supreme Court defined a limited scope of enforcement for federal public corruption laws. The Court vacated the conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, who was found to have traded official favors for personal gifts and loans. The Court held that actions such as setting up meetings and hosting events did not constitute official acts under corruption statutes. The Supreme Court ruled in McDonnell v. United States that arranging meetings and hosting events alone did not qualify as official acts under corruption statutes. Official acts must involve exerting pressure or advising on a pending matter to result in a decision or action by a public official. The Court also clarified that illegal gratuities are prohibited under federal law as a lesser offense included in the bribery statute. The prohibition on illegal gratuities penalizes public officials who seek or accept something of value personally for any official act performed. Unlike bribery, illegal gratuities do not require corrupt intent or evidence of a quid pro quo. It is a lesser offense included in the bribery statute. The Supreme Court distinguishes between bribery and illegal gratuities based on intent. Bribery requires a quid pro quo, while illegal gratuities only require the gratuity to be given or accepted for an official act. Illegal gratuities may be a reward for a future or past act without the need for a specific corrupt intent. The intent required for an illegal gratuity distinguishes it from a gift or lawful campaign contribution. The intent involves knowledge of being compensated for a specific official act, with guilty knowledge of the donor's illicit reasons. This lower standard of intent for illegal gratuities increases the risk of campaign contributions violating the prohibition. Campaign contributions given for or because of an official position are generally not considered illegal gratuities, as they are intended for campaign or political uses. Improper contributions are more likely to be scrutinized under campaign finance laws. Federal candidates are required to have a principal campaign committee for receiving and expending contributions for designated purposes. The federal law prohibits candidates from using campaign contributions for personal use. Contributions directed to a campaign committee or third party are generally not prohibited, unless they are used to financially benefit the official personally. In the United States v. Brewster case, campaign contributions were found to be illegal gratuities when given to a sham committee that the Senator used for personal expenses. The Hobbs Act also prohibits public officials from using their position to demand contributions, separate from bribery and illegal gratuities. The Hobbs Act prohibits public officials from using their position to demand contributions, even if the payments are made to third parties like campaign committees. Demands for payments under the guise of 'donations' can be considered extortion if there is wrongful use of official position to induce the contribution. The Supreme Court has clarified that elected officials violate the law only when there is evidence of a specific quid pro quo, similar to bribery. The Supreme Court clarified that the bribery statute is violated only when an elected official explicitly promises to perform or not perform an official act in exchange for campaign contributions. Simply the nearness in time of official acts and campaign contributions does not constitute extortion under the law. Campaigns must be financed through private contributions, but officials must not use their position to demand contributions. Legislators cannot be charged with extortion for supporting legislation benefiting constituents before or after receiving campaign contributions. This would criminalize common political practices and the unavoidable nature of private campaign financing. Campaign contributions should not be exchanged for official favors, as clarified by the Supreme Court. The explicitness requirement in distinguishing between campaign contributions given in anticipation of official action and those given in exchange for a promise of official action is crucial in determining extortion charges. The understanding of a clear quid pro quo, whether verbally explicit or not, is necessary for a violation of the Hobbs Act. The terms of the exchange must be unambiguous for the explicitness requirement to be satisfied. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld extortion convictions of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich by emphasizing the clarity of the quid pro quo arrangement. The Hobbs Act does not require explicit demands for quid pro quo in extortion cases involving payments to politicians. Non-verbal understandings can also constitute extortion. Corruption in politics is prohibited under federal wire and mail fraud statutes, including the prohibition on honest services fraud. This provision was initially unclear but has been applied to public officials participating in schemes affecting honest services. The Supreme Court clarified the application of the honest services fraud provision in public corruption cases, narrowing its scope to schemes involving bribery or kickbacks. Recent court decisions have further clarified that the government does not need to prove an explicit quid pro quo bribery scheme, but can infer intent from the evidence. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the link between bribery and honest services fraud in the case of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell. The Court applied precedents under the bribery statute to determine if acts by a public official should be considered \"official acts.\""
