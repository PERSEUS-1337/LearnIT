    "content": "In FY2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated over $280 billion for federal contracts, surpassing all other federal agencies combined. Analysts and officials believe that utilizing data for acquisition decision-making could lead to significant cost savings, resource allocation improvements, and enhanced military operations effectiveness. Congress has taken steps to improve DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability, acquisition reform provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts, and conducting hearings on agency operations and acquisition reform. Improved data analysis could potentially lead to more effective decision-making, prompting Congress to consider enhancing oversight and enabling DOD to conduct better operations. The report examines the extent to which DOD effectively uses data for decision-making, critical elements needed for better data utilization, recent efforts to improve data use, and potential questions for Congress. It focuses on defense acquisitions as a case study. Data analysis is seen as crucial for informed policy decisions and program management. Access to sufficient data is crucial for measuring the effectiveness of government programs and informing policy decisions. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and wasteful spending. Reports have highlighted instances where a lack of data hindered effective reviews and decision-making within the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense (DOD) faced challenges in managing its supply chain in Afghanistan due to a lack of data for decision-making. This mismanagement affected the distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter and overall operations. Despite the importance of data, DOD was criticized for not incorporating it sufficiently into decision-making processes, leading to policy decisions being made without substantive data. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the significance of data-driven decision-making in the private sector. In the private sector, data-driven decisions are crucial, and this also applies in government settings. Congress passed the DATA Act in 2014 to improve government operations by establishing data standards and ensuring accurate spending data. Lack of basic data hinders management in the Department of Defense, as highlighted in a recent hearing by Senator John McCain. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the challenges in obtaining accurate information within the Department of Defense, leading to inefficiency and hindering national security. The lack of data impairs decision-making and assessment of military priorities. Analysts suggest improving information systems, data accuracy, and using data for decision-making to address these issues. The lack of proper information systems within the Department of Defense hinders decision-making and management of weapon system portfolios. Manual processes are labor-intensive and prone to errors, preventing leaders from fully utilizing valuable program information. Existing systems need to be capable of effectively performing required functions, as some DOD systems have been found to be fundamentally flawed. The Department of Defense's efforts to improve budgetary accounting are hindered by flawed financial management systems and transaction control weaknesses. Multiple IT systems and databases with conflicting data pose challenges in analyzing specific data sets. Calls have been made to enhance the architecture of data systems for collecting, managing, and analyzing DOD acquisition data due to unreliable or incomplete information in existing systems. The Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) is a central database of U.S. government-wide procurement. It is relied upon by Congress, executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public for understanding federal contracting spending. However, concerns have been raised about the accuracy, limitations, and reliability of the data in FPDS. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the data often lacks utility, accuracy, and completeness. The Office of Management and Budget has released guidance for executive branch agencies to implement GAO recommendations to improve FPDS data quality. Concerns over data reliability have led analysts to use FPDS for identifying trends and rough estimations. The General Services Administration is overhauling data systems, including FPDS, to enhance reliability and usefulness. Stakeholder feedback is being gathered to improve data systems, with upgrades expected in 2017 or 2018. GAO found inconsistencies in DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs in 2012. The GAO found inconsistencies in DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs, leading to limited visibility for oversight. Insufficient data hindered analysis of cost growth, identification of cost drivers, and development of cost management plans. DOD components did not consistently track O&S costs against final estimates. The AT&L office is now requiring more consistent use of units for calculating O&S, but building a data bank will take years. Similar data access, quality, and availability issues exist in other phases of the acquisition process. Some policies and acquisition decisions are made without sufficient data analysis due to data access and sharing barriers within the DoD. Institutional and cultural barriers, along with bureaucratic incentives, restrict data access and sharing, leading to a conservative bias in labeling and a reluctance to share information. Decisionmakers struggle to effectively use existing data. Some observers argue that the Department of Defense (DOD) faces challenges in effectively using existing data due to a lack of personnel capable of complex data analysis. Senior leaders within DOD may not understand how to utilize data for decision-making, leading to unchecked statistics and decisions made without validation of assumptions. Decisionmakers may also avoid using data that does not support their intended decisions. It is important to recognize the limitations of data and avoid gathering data unnecessarily in a data-driven approach to decision-making. Some cautionary points are raised regarding the collection and analysis of data. It is emphasized that data should serve a purpose and not be gathered aimlessly. The cost of collecting and analyzing data should be justified by the benefit of the analysis. Striving for more data may not always lead to better analysis, as data does not need to be perfect to be useful. Decisionmakers should focus on whether sufficient data exist from which to draw reasonable conclusions. Critical questions to ask when working with data include what useful analysis can be developed now, how to model correctly, and understanding the uncertainty bounds of the data. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating for large programs is imprecise, but a good estimate can help in understanding risks and aid in budgeting and resource allocation. Despite over $80 billion spent on contracts in Afghanistan from FY2007 to FY2013, accurate analysis was lacking. The U.S. government and DOD struggled to track and manage data for strategic contracting decisions in Afghanistan due to a lack of reliable information and inadequate IT systems. This hindered supply chain management and affected operations, with conflicting information from different systems further complicating the issue. In 2009, Greg Gardner, then-Deputy Chief Information Officer (DCIO) for the Director of National Intelligence, highlighted the inefficiencies in the U.S. government's 23 different network information technology systems in Afghanistan. These systems were often duplicative, not interoperable, leading to wasteful spending and poor data sharing. Data reliability was questionable, with incomplete and unreliable information being tracked and sent to the central database. For example, only 14% of reconstruction project records contained all required data elements. Some data, like IED attack reports, were more accurately tracked than others. Data managers estimated that only about 10% of all data records were eventually put into the central database, with an error rate of approximately 50%. Officials were often unaware of existing data, such as the Central Command quarterly contractor census. DOD acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability and appropriateness of gathered data. DOD has made progress in identifying and gathering data for better contract decisions, but significant gaps remain in data availability and reliability. Efforts are underway to improve IT systems and analyze data for policy decisions, with a need to integrate data usage into the organization's culture and routines. Leadership support is crucial for a successful analytics program in the Department of Defense (DOD). Senior officials have emphasized the importance of transitioning to a data-informed decision-making process. This shift is evident in various initiatives, such as the annual data-driven reports on defense acquisitions. Senior leadership is also promoting a more data-driven approach to supply chain management. The Department of Defense is investing in data-driven processes for supply chain management and decision-making. Efforts include improving data quality, overhauling data systems like FPDS, and establishing an analytics center for measuring acquisition effectiveness. The Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office is also working on the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data. The CADE project aims to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online system for decision-makers and cost analysts. The military services are also integrating data into decision-making processes, with the Air Force identifying potential cost savings and developing a baseline of past acquisition cost performance. Congress has been credited with helping the Department of Defense focus on and improve the use of data. Congress has played a key role in improving the Department of Defense's use of data for decision-making, with actions such as The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focusing on using data early in the acquisition process. The act also required DOD to conduct root cause analysis for major defense programs with cost growth. Additionally, the FY2010 NDAA mandates DOD to be audit-ready for financial statements, aiming to enhance accuracy and reliability of management information. Auditability is crucial for the Department of Defense to improve business operations and resource deployment efficiency. Past efforts to enhance data-based decision-making have had mixed results, with some successes like the Navy's Air System Command but also failures like the Air Force's cancelled ERP system. It will take years for DOD to implement and improve data systems and foster a data-driven decision-making culture. Building a robust historical database is essential due to sparse historic data, making it challenging to assess contemporary observations accurately. To truly understand the performance of our acquisition system, building a robust historical database is essential. Congressional action plays a key role in promoting data-driven decision-making within the Department of Defense. Allocating resources and passing legislation can support the gathering and analysis of data, similar to the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Effective data analysis requires appropriate information systems and qualified personnel. Congress may need to allocate resources to build analytical capability within the Department of Defense, including investing in IT systems and increasing the capacity of relevant offices. Key considerations include whether DOD has a clear strategy for data needs, the in-house capability for data analysis, and a strategy for hiring qualified personnel. Analysts emphasize the importance of a data-driven decision-making culture within the organization. Having a culture that values data-driven decisions and integrates data gathering into standard routines is crucial for organizations. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use in decision-making within the Department of Defense. Key questions include assessing DOD's culture for data utilization, examining incentives that promote or hinder data use, incorporating data analysis into routine processes, and ensuring a clear strategy for data analytics in acquisitions and operations. A recent RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in data access for acquisition personnel, emphasizing the need for improved data-sharing while considering information security concerns. The Department of Defense faces challenges in balancing data-sharing for efficiency with information security concerns. Congress may question how DOD can achieve this balance effectively."
