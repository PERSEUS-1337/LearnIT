    "content": "The \"Nuclear Used Fuel Prize Act of 2008\" defines key terms such as \"administering entity,\" \"Department,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Congress acknowledges the rising cost of energy as a hindrance to American economic progress and a burden on families. Nuclear energy is seen as a safe, efficient, and affordable source of renewable energy for long-term independence. The safe storage of used nuclear fuel on reactor sites is a concern, with plans to remove it for more efficient management and lower costs. Development of alternatives to current storage facilities, including the Yucca Mountain long-term storage facility, would allow used nuclear fuel from decommissioned reactor sites to be moved for final clean up. Citizens and communities interested in developing alternatives, such as the Yucca Mountain facility, should be incentivized to move forward. Prize legislation has been successful in solving difficult problems, and establishing a program of prize incentives for used nuclear fuel management plans is necessary. Prize authority is necessary for incentivizing the development of alternatives to current storage facilities for used nuclear fuel. The Secretary will award cash prizes to advance nuclear used fuel storage research, development, and commercial application. Competitions will be advertised widely to encourage broad participation, with details announced in the Federal Register. The Secretary may administer the competition. The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a private entity to administer prize competitions for nuclear used fuel storage research. The administering entity will advertise the competition, raise funds for administrative costs and cash prizes, develop selection criteria, determine award amounts, and protect participants' intellectual property. The Secretary may withhold confidential business information submitted by participants in competitive programs under this Act. Rules will be developed with input from industry, citizens, and corporations for safe nuclear energy storage. Prizes may consist of Federal funds, funds from the administering entity, or funds raised through grants or donations. The Secretary can accept funds from other Federal agencies for cash prizes and must not give special consideration for donations. The announcement of prizes cannot be made until all necessary funds are secured. The Department must wait to announce a prize until all necessary funds have been appropriated or committed by the administering entity. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY. To be eligible to win a prize under this Act, an individual or entity must notify the administering entity of intent to submit ideas, comply with all requirements in the Federal Register notice, be incorporated in the U.S. with a primary place of business, not be a Federal entity or employee, not use Federal funding to compete, and not represent a foreign government or agent for a nuclear fuel storage facility proposal. The proposal involves a spent nuclear fuel storage facility or repository. It requires presenting a plan to remove used nuclear fuel until advanced fuel cycle facilities and a final repository are developed for disposal. SEC. 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\n\nThe Federal Government will not claim intellectual property rights from participants in competitions under this Act but may negotiate licenses for developed technologies. Prizes awarded must be commercialized if recipients do not take steps to apply the technology.\n\nSEC. 7. WAIVER OF LIABILITY. SEC. 7. WAIVER OF LIABILITY. The Secretary may require registered participants to waive claims against the Federal Government and the administering entity (except claims for willful misconduct) for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits arising from participation in a competition under this Act. The Secretary shall give notice of any waiver required in the notice. The Secretary may not require a waiver against the administering entity for unauthorized use or disclosure of intellectual property. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds for awards and administrative costs for the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2020 under this Act. Amounts received from awards cannot be taxed by any authority. Funds for prize awards shall remain available until expended and may be transferred or reprogrammed after 11 fiscal years. No funds can be obligated or paid in violation of the law."
