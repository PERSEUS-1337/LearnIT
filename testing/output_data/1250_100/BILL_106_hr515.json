    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings in the United States. The US leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized countries. Additionally, the number of nonfatal unintentional firearm injuries treated in US hospital emergency rooms annually is nearly 8 times the number of deaths. In the United States, children as young as 3 years old are able to fire most commercially available handguns, with a significant percentage having the finger strength to do so. Firearms are not subject to minimum safety standards in the US, unlike other products. The Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research found that 74% of Americans support safety regulations for the firearms industry. Many trigger locks and safety devices are inadequate in preventing accidental firearm discharge and children from accessing firearms. SEC. 3. REGULATION OF HANDGUN DISCHARGE PROTECTION PRODUCTS. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of child injury from accidental handgun discharge. Regulations will establish a minimum safety standard for these products, ensuring they are of high quality and cannot be easily removed from a handgun. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce child injury risk. The standard will prevent easy removal from handguns and consider poison prevention packaging test protocols. The deadline for issuing the standard is 12 months after enactment, and it will take effect 6 months after issuance.

Enforcement measures are outlined in Section 8. The Secretary can impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations of the Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act. Additionally, the Secretary has the authority to revoke a federal firearms license for violations of the Act. Individuals affected by violations can pursue damages through a private cause of action in federal court, with the possibility of receiving attorney's fees as part of the costs. Private Enforcement of This Act allows any interested person to bring an action in a US district court to enforce the Act or restrain violations. The court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. Compliance with the Act does not relieve liability under common law or State law. The Secretary's failure to take action authorized under the Act is not admissible in litigation. Criminal penalties can be imposed on violators notified by the Secretary. Violation of this Act or its regulations regarding handgun discharge protection products may result in a fine, imprisonment up to 2 years, or both. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW. This Act does not override State laws unless they are inconsistent with this Act, and only to the extent of the inconsistency. State laws providing greater protection to children regarding handguns are not considered inconsistent with this Act. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS.
