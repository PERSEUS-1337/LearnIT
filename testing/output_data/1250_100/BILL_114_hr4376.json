    "content": "The \"Pay Stub Disclosure Act\" is the short title of the Act. The Act includes findings related to pay stub disclosure. Congress finds that the lack of Federal requirements for pay stubs and payroll record inspections hinders efforts to address wage violations. A survey showed many low-wage workers were underpaid or not paid overtime, with a majority not receiving pay stubs. Some employers use practices that make it hard for workers to calculate pay. Despite existing regulations, the lack of remedies limits the effectiveness of pay record keeping. The Supreme Court ruled in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. that if an employer fails to keep required records under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the burden shifts to the employer to disprove the employee's evidence of work hours and compensation. Many courts have failed to shift this burden, giving equal weight to employer testimony and employee evidence. SEC. 3. PAY STUB REQUIREMENTS. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include a new disclosure requirement for employers to provide specific information to non-exempt employees within 15 days of hiring or any changes in pay or other details. This includes details on pay rates, employer names, and contact information.

Employers must also provide detailed information on each pay stub, including pay period, employee name, total hours worked, gross and net wages, and salary amount for the period.

The pay stub must be provided each pay period and can be given as a separate document, a detachable part of a paycheck, or electronically. Recordkeeping requirements have also been updated.

Employers must also provide copies of employee records upon request and notify employees of their right to receive a pay stub within 15 days of hire.
