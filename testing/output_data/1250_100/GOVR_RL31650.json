    "content": "In February 2002, congressional intelligence committees launched a Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve the Intelligence Community's ability to prevent future attacks. Public hearings began in September 2002 and concluded in October 2002, with a final report expected in early 2003. Congress passed the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act in November 2002. The FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act established an independent commission to investigate the events of 9/11, led by Thomas H. Kean. The commission will consider findings from the Joint Inquiry and make recommendations for preventing future attacks. There was initial support for the investigation, despite concerns about its impact on policymakers during a crisis. An independent commission was established to investigate the events of 9/11, led by Thomas H. Kean. Public anxieties about a possible \"intelligence failure\" led to the conclusion that an official investigation was needed. The House initially voted to establish the commission, but the provision was dropped in favor of Congress conducting its own investigation focused on intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The Joint Inquiry initiated by the two intelligence committees faced difficulties over staff assignments, leading to the resignation of the first staff director, L. Britt Snider. In 2002, concerns about staff appointments led to the resignation of the first staff director of the Joint Inquiry. Eleanor Hill took over as staff director, and public hearings began in mid-September. The staff consisted of twenty-four professionals with backgrounds in intelligence, law enforcement, and oversight, divided into five investigative teams. They reviewed over 400,000 pages of documents, conducted 400 interviews, and collected information from various federal agencies and private sector entities. Some disagreements about Joint Inquiry procedures were also revealed during the hearings. Some Members have expressed concern about making public an interim report that had not been approved by the committees. Complaints have surfaced about intelligence agencies being uncooperative in providing information. There were disagreements about holding public hearings before the investigation was completed and reports of communication breakdowns within the committee. Public hearings in September-October 2002 provided insights into the Joint Inquiry staff's directions and conclusions that the committees may draw from the investigation. Testimonies included representatives of victims' families, law enforcement and intelligence officials, outside experts, and current/former senior officials. The Intelligence Community had general indications of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of 2001, but did not have specific information prior to September 11. The history of concern with the terrorist threat dates back to the 1980s, with a focus on Al Qaeda since the early 1990s. A Counterterrorist Center was established at the CIA in 1986, with a special unit to monitor Osama bin Laden created in 1996. Hill discussed the response of agencies to various terrorist attacks, highlighting successful disruptions of planned attacks by effective intelligence and law enforcement work. She noted the shift in the nature of terrorist threats post-Cold War, with a focus on the emergence of Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden in the mid-1990s. By 1996, attention shifted to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Intelligence agencies warned of potential attacks in 2001, with a briefing indicating a significant terrorist attack was imminent. The FBI expanded its presence overseas to track and suppress terrorist groups. The Intelligence Community had consistently reported on Al Qaeda activities, but a comprehensive listing of terrorist threats to the United States had not been prepared. Despite threat warnings in mid-2001, there was not a comprehensive effort to educate the American public. The FBI field office in Phoenix called for further investigation of individuals with possible ties to terrorist organizations attending flight colleges in the U.S., but the recommendations were not acted upon before September 11. This reflected administrative, legal, and policy barriers that may have hindered the FBI from perceiving terrorist planning. The FBI's handling of the Phoenix EC may have hindered the perception of terrorist planning. The Inquiry highlighted missed opportunities to include hijackers in watchlists, potentially preventing their entry into the U.S. The absence of a formal system was cited as the reason for this failure. The CIA's failure to watchlist suspected terrorists, including individuals like al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, before they entered the U.S. drew criticism. The Inquiry also examined the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen detained in the U.S. on conspiracy charges related to aircraft piracy. FBI officials in Minnesota sought a warrant to investigate Zacarias Moussaoui's notes and computer disks before September 11, but authorization was not approved. There were debates over the type of warrant to use, and at one point, the FBI planned to deport Moussaoui to France for a search. Additionally, there were limitations in the U.S. response to Al Qaeda, including the challenge of monitoring training camps in Afghanistan and the need for a more integrated approach involving diplomatic, intelligence, economic, and military efforts. Ms. Hill highlighted the lack of mobilization of public opinion in the fight against terrorism, with little effort made by previous administrations to alert the American public to the extent of the threat. She also criticized the FBI for not making necessary changes to effectively combat terrorism, citing a lack of resources and low priority given to counterterrorism efforts. Additionally, she pointed out the inability to systematically collect information on terrorist plots as a fundamental problem. The FBI's decentralized structure and case-based approach hindered the ability to gather intelligence on terrorist threats in the U.S. There was a lack of focus on radical activity domestically, with a particular disinclination to target suspects residing outside the country. This gap in the U.S. government's counterterrorism structure led to a failure to assess how international terrorist groups might target the United States. The FBI's focus on gathering evidence for crimes hindered strategic analysis of threats to the homeland. Law enforcement tools became the primary counterterrorism strategy, leading to prosecutions for immigration violations but not targeting masterminds abroad. FBI's disinclination to cooperate with intelligence agencies for fear of tainted evidence further complicated counterterrorism efforts. Osama Bin Laden was indicted in 1998, but challenges remained in prosecuting high-level terrorists. The institutional \"walls\" were established to govern the use of intelligence information, derived from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. These walls, seen as bureaucratic hurdles, hindered the sharing of crucial information, as noted by an FBI official in New York. The FBI investigator expressed concern about the lack of resources and communication between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, hindering the search for Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi before the September 11 attacks. The investigation highlighted inadequate communication among intelligence and law enforcement agencies post-9/11, emphasizing the need for better information sharing and coordination. Concerns were raised about the removal of \"walls\" between different types of information, potentially compromising civil liberties. The public hearings by intelligence committees focused on the reaction to radical Islamic terrorism in the 1990s, failures in sharing terrorist information, and proposals to improve counterterrorism capabilities. The public hearings highlighted government awareness of terrorist threats, thwarted attacks, and challenges in sharing intelligence. Testimonies pointed to failures in information sharing and the need for better guidance for agencies. Families of 9/11 victims criticized government failures in preventing the attacks. Several family representatives criticized government agencies for their failures in preventing the 9/11 attacks and called for an investigation by an independent commission. Former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger testified about the Clinton Administration's efforts to prioritize counterterrorism, increase budgets, and establish a White House-level Counterterrorism Security Group. Berger highlighted successes in thwarting terrorist attacks but noted that the FBI was not as focused on counterterrorism as the CIA. Former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger emphasized the need for improved coordination and integration of intelligence, as well as the importance of predictive intelligence and human intelligence in counterterrorism efforts. He highlighted the disparity in intelligence sharing between the CIA and FBI, with the FBI Director providing a summary of information on the 9/11 hijackers and their activities in the U.S. Berger called for strengthening the role of the DCI and increasing resources for analytical efforts. Terrorists used simple box cutters and had sophisticated knowledge to plan attacks abroad, finance activities, and communicate without detection. They exploited vulnerabilities in our society and operated lawfully. Mueller acknowledged valid criticisms of intelligence failures, such as the Phoenix memo not being disseminated to all field offices. Testimony from Mueller was supplemented by his predecessor Louis Freeh. Louis Freeh, Mueller's predecessor, described the FBI's counterterrorist efforts during his tenure. The number of agents assigned to counterterrorism doubled, legal attaches in U.S. embassies improved information acquisition, and Joint Terrorism Task Forces were established. Freeh also discussed the FBI's involvement in investigating the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. Louis Freeh, the predecessor of Mueller, acknowledged the national security threat posed by the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. He highlighted the FBI's IT shortcomings and delayed upgrades, which were only addressed after September 11. Freeh also mentioned the restrictions on FBI agents, which were lifted in May 2002 by the Justice Department. Admiral Lowell Jacoby, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was involved in these efforts. Admiral Lowell Jacoby, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, expressed concerns about barriers hindering analysts' access to information. He emphasized the need for a new paradigm where analysts, not collectors, own information. Testimonies supported breaking down barriers for better information exchange among agencies, with Mary Jo White advocating for this change. The Director of NSA and a lead figure in terrorism investigations recommended addressing issues related to the bifurcation of intelligence and law enforcement communities in international terrorism investigations. They highlighted the challenges in conducting electronic searches for law enforcement purposes compared to foreign intelligence purposes. The need for better information exchange among agencies was emphasized by various testimonies. The Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, testified about the emergence of Bin Laden as a terrorist leader in the 1990s and the need for improvements in intelligence and information sharing to combat terrorism. James Gilmore, Chairman of the Advisory Panel on Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism, emphasized the importance of finding the balance between security and liberty based on the American people's preferences. George J. Tenet discussed the CIA's comprehensive operation plan in 1999 to disrupt Al Qaeda finances, track their activities, and capture Osama Bin Laden. The CIA recruited officers with various skills for counterterrorist assignments, leading to successful operations worldwide. By 9/11, the CIA had established a vast network in Afghanistan, providing crucial support during the military campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Additionally, efforts were made to prevent terrorist attacks during the Millennium and to dismantle terrorist groups in Europe. The CIA conducted operations in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia to identify and disrupt terrorist groups. There was a heightened awareness of potential terrorist activities in the spring and summer of 2001, with a focus on the Middle East. While there was concern about a catastrophic attack within the U.S., analysts did not prioritize reports of airplane hijackings or plots to drive airplanes into buildings. Clues are easier to recognize in hindsight among vast amounts of data. Tenet highlighted the impact of budget cuts in the early 1990s on the CIA, with a loss of one in four positions. However, funding for counterterrorism had increased, with a significant rise just before September 11. Tenet requested a substantial increase in intelligence funding for counterterrorism, but only small portions were approved. He emphasized the limitations of relying on supplemental appropriations for long-term programs. The intelligence committees released findings, conclusions, and recommendations related to the events of September 11, highlighting systemic weaknesses in intelligence and law enforcement. The lack of a government-wide strategy for acquiring and analyzing intelligence was emphasized, along with issues such as limited funding, poor coordination, and inadequate human intelligence. The intelligence committees recommended creating a Director of National Intelligence separate from the CIA to prioritize intelligence collection and analysis. They also called for a government-wide strategy for combating terrorism, including improving the Department of Homeland Security's role in counterterrorism analysis and intelligence dissemination. The intelligence committees recommended enhancing DHS access to counterterrorism intelligence, improving FBI capabilities, addressing NSA technological challenges, and investing in long-term counterterrorism capabilities. Senator Shelby criticized the DCI's lack of authority over the Intelligence Community and called for a review of the National Security Act of 1947. Senator Shelby criticized the failure of the Joint Inquiry to identify key individuals responsible for the country's unpreparedness on September 11, 2001. He emphasized the need for the Intelligence Community to be more agile and responsive to evolving threats, advocating for improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination. Shelby stressed the importance of learning from past mistakes and developing ways to quickly allocate resources to address pressing issues. Senator Shelby criticized the lack of coordination among agencies and the dominance of collection agencies in controlling information. He supported Admiral Jacoby's call for analysts to have deeper access to data and tools to mine for useful information. Shelby highlighted the FBI's collapse in counterterrorism functions and suggested radical reform was overdue. Senator Shelby criticized the FBI's lack of coordination and advocated for radical reform. He emphasized the need for human intelligence in counterterrorism and supported the establishment of an independent commission to assess the background to the September 2001 attacks. The President signed legislation on November 27, 2002, establishing an independent commission to investigate the facts and causes of the September 11 attacks. The commission will gather evidence from government agencies, conduct hearings, and make recommendations within 18 months. It will also study organizational arrangements for handling terrorist threats and consider giving the DCI more authority over intelligence resources. The proposal to give the DCI additional authority to manage intelligence resources and focus on key priorities has been discussed, but there is no consensus yet. There are also concerns about the role of intelligence agencies in tracking terrorists in the U.S., including the impact of the USA Patriot Act. Some suggest an independent commission should review the relationship between intelligence and law enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. Former CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz emphasized the need for Congress to revisit certain prohibitions. Former CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz testified on October 3 about the need for Congress to reconsider the prohibition on CIA involvement in domestic law enforcement activities. There are concerns about balancing intelligence gathering for national security with protecting civil liberties and the justice system. Senator Graham also called for a re-examination of the scope and limitations of domestic collection of terrorism-related intelligence post-9/11. The current government structure, with the FBI primarily responsible for intelligence collection, is being questioned for its adequacy. The Joint Inquiry is investigating the background of the September 11 attacks and the sharing of information among agencies. Changes have been made in legislation and procedures to address these issues, but some critics argue that mixing intelligence and law enforcement roles can undermine civil liberties. The independent commission is expected to submit its final report in 2003 after declassification, reflecting members' views on agency performance and proposing changes. The report will influence counterterrorist oversight in the 108th Congress and aims to bridge the gap between intelligence and law enforcement, emphasizing the FBI's focus on counterterrorism. The committees have already released evidence and testimony on the background of the September 11 attacks. The FBI is currently focused on counterterrorism following the tragic events of September 11, 2001. There have been statutory changes and the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. Further changes may be necessary, especially in intelligence and law enforcement, to combat international terrorism. Discussions are ongoing about potential changes, including more precise protections of civil liberties."
