    "content": "Negotiating parties of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. The ACTA will enter into force after the sixth formal approval is deposited. Mexico signed the ACTA on July 11, 2012, requiring ratification in the Mexican Congress. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012, leading to suspensions in several EU member states. The European Commission halted the ACTA ratification process on February 22, 2012. On January 25, 2012, the European Commission placed the ACTA ratification process on hold and submitted the agreement to the European Court of Justice to determine its compatibility with EU law. Five EU member states did not sign the agreement due to procedural issues. In October 2011, several countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States signed the ACTA. The final version of the agreement text was publicly released in May 2011 after nearly three years of negotiations. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a new agreement aimed at combating intellectual property rights infringement. Negotiated by several countries including the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and others, the ACTA focuses on enforcing trademarks and copyrights, with provisions for civil enforcement, border measures, and criminal enforcement for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. It also addresses IPR infringement in the digital environment and provides enhanced enforcement best practices. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was negotiated by several countries to combat intellectual property rights infringement, focusing on enforcing trademarks and copyrights. The negotiation concluded in October 2010, with countries having until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. All negotiating parties, except Mexico and Switzerland, have signed the agreement, but no formal instrument of approval has been submitted yet. The idea of negotiating the ACTA was conceived in 2006 by the United States and Japan, with formal negotiations starting in June 2008. The ACTA negotiation involved multiple parties, including Australia, Canada, South Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, and Singapore. The final round took place in Japan in October 2010, resulting in a largely finalized text of the agreement. On October 1, 2011, several countries signed the ACTA, with others expressing support and preparation to sign. The goal was to achieve prompt entry into force and actively support the agreement's goals. On January 25, 2012, the European Union and 22 member states signed the ACTA, with Mexico also signing on July 11, 2012. The agreement will enter into force after the sixth instrument of ratification is deposited. Negotiating parties are now going through domestic approval processes, with the USTR negotiating the ACTA as an executive agreement for the U.S. government. The USTR states that the ACTA is consistent with existing U.S. law and may not require congressional approval. The timeline for the United States to formally approve the ACTA is unclear. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012, halting its entry into force in the EU. Several EU member states, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia, have suspended or not initiated domestic adoption of the ACTA. The European Commission has put the ratification process on hold and submitted the agreement to the European Court of Justice for review. There is a possibility of the ACTA being revived after the court ruling. Some countries may need to pass new laws to implement ACTA enforcement standards, including granting customs officials authority to investigate trademark infringement and copyright piracy. Canada recently incorporated WIPO Internet treaties into domestic law with copyright bill C-11. Most ACTA negotiating countries are economically advanced and value IPR-based industries. The ACTA negotiation involves economically advanced countries that value IPR-based industries. The agreement establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, international cooperation, and enhanced measures. Key provisions include discussions on the agreement's nature, relationship to existing agreements, privacy, disclosure of information, and definitions of terms. The ACTA allows flexibility for Parties to implement more extensive IPR enforcement than required. The ACTA allows flexibility for Parties to implement more extensive IPR enforcement than required, with general obligations for enforcement, civil enforcement, border measures, criminal enforcement, and enforcement of IPR in the digital environment. It commits Parties to effective IPR enforcement action that provides expeditious and deterrent remedies, avoids creating barriers to legitimate trade, and provides fair treatment for participants. The Parties in the ACTA consider the seriousness of infringement, third-party infringements, and applicable measures in enforcement provisions. Civil enforcement requires judicial procedures for IPR enforcement, including injunctions, damages, recovery of costs, information disclosure, destruction of infringing goods, and provisional measures. The ACTA parties consider the seriousness of infringement and applicable measures in enforcement provisions. Civil enforcement requires judicial procedures for IPR enforcement, including injunctions, damages, recovery of costs, information disclosure, and destruction of infringing goods. Border measures aim to enforce IPR at borders without discriminating among different forms of IPR and without creating barriers to legitimate trade. Customs authorities can suspend the release of suspect goods, and right holders can request the suspension of suspect goods. The ACTA parties require procedures for determining IPR infringement, including the authority to order destruction of infringing goods and impose penalties. Criminal enforcement mandates penalties for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy, including imprisonment and fines as deterrents. Authorities can seize and order the forfeiture or destruction of counterfeit goods. The ACTA parties require procedures for determining IPR infringement, including the authority to order destruction of infringing goods and impose penalties. Criminal enforcement mandates penalties for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy, including imprisonment and fines as deterrents. Authorities can seize and order the forfeiture or destruction of counterfeit goods, materials, and assets derived from infringing activities. Digital enforcement obligations include ensuring effective enforcement against IPR infringement in the digital environment while avoiding barriers to legitimate activity. The ACTA parties focus on enforcing intellectual property rights (IPR) without creating barriers to legitimate activity. Parties may order online service providers to disclose subscriber information for infringement cases. Legal protection and remedies against circumventing technological measures are emphasized. Enforcement practices involve developing expertise, collecting data on IPR infringement, and promoting best practices. The ACTA parties emphasize best practices for preventing infringement and promoting transparency in IPR enforcement. They also discuss international cooperation to address challenges in cross-border trade of counterfeit products. The ACTA establishes an ACTA Committee to oversee the agreement's implementation, proposed amendments, and terms of accession. It allows for information exchange, capacity building, and technical assistance among Parties. The agreement remains open for signature until May 1, 2013, and will enter into force 30 days after the deposit of the sixth signature. The ACTA agreement will enter into force 30 days after the deposit of the sixth instrument of ratification, acceptance, or approval. The United States conducted the negotiation through the USTR, which leads U.S. trade agreements. The agreement was negotiated as an executive agreement, not requiring congressional approval unless it necessitates changes to U.S. law. The USTR ensured consistency with U.S. law during the negotiation process. The USTR states that the ACTA is consistent with existing U.S. law, including copyright, patent, and trademark laws. It does not require changes to U.S. law for implementation and can be carried out under existing legal authority. The congressional role in the ACTA is rooted in the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce and intellectual property rights. Congress has oversight and consultative roles in the ACTA negotiation process, despite not having a consultative role established in statute. The use of an executive agreement for ACTA negotiations differs from past approaches to international trade negotiations on intellectual property rights. The United States has concerns about global IPR infringement due to high costs for research and development in IPR-based industries. The development of easily duplicated technologies and products, like digital media, has increased piracy due to low risks and high profits. Growing Internet usage has also contributed to the distribution of counterfeit goods. Inadequate penalties in some countries do not deter counterfeiting and piracy. The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) is crucial for the U.S. economy, with counterfeiting and piracy having negative economic, health, safety, and security consequences. The U.S. participates in ACTA negotiations to address the economic impact of IPR infringement and promote innovation for competitiveness. Advocates of a strong international IPR regime claim that counterfeiting and piracy inflict billions of dollars of revenue and trade losses annually on legitimate IPR-based industries. The secretive and illicit nature of IPR infringement makes it difficult to track production and trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, especially with the increasing dissemination of digital media through the Internet. Some companies may be hesitant to disclose information about IPR infringement issues for fear of affecting their product marketing. Some question the commercial rationale for the ACTA, as estimates for losses from IPR infringement are often generated by industry groups with self-interest. Critics argue that IPR protection favors private rights over broader economic and social welfare, potentially stifling the free flow of information. Advocates of civil liberties highlight the importance of evaluating economic benefits of exceptions to exclusive rights, such as \"fair use\" exceptions in copyright law. The U.S. participation in the ACTA negotiation is driven by concerns over innovation promotion, health and safety risks from counterfeit products, and security issues related to counterfeiting and piracy. There are debates on the impact of increased IPR protection on public health and access to affordable medicines. The ACTA focuses on security concerns related to counterfeiting and piracy, with concerns about organized crime syndicates profiting from copyright infringement. The United States pursues IPR objectives through various trade policy mechanisms, including multilaterally through the WTO and regionally through FTAs. The ACTA builds on commitments from the WTO TRIPS Agreement for international rules on intellectual property protection. The United States supports the negotiation of the ACTA to address gaps in the TRIPS Agreement for IPR challenges, especially related to new technologies and piracy in digital media. There are ongoing debates about the legitimacy and fairness of the TRIPS Agreement in balancing private rights and public obligations. The USTR seeks \"TRIPS-plus\" provisions in regional and bilateral FTAs to enhance IPR protection beyond TRIPS standards. The ongoing debate about the balance of rights and obligations under an IPR regime has led to revisions in U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia, particularly in pharmaceutical-related IPR provisions. The U.S. FTAs have influenced the ACTA, with the U.S. aiming to model it on IPR enforcement provisions from agreements with Australia, Morocco, Singapore, and South Korea. The ACTA aims to expand stronger IPR commitments to more countries, focusing on criminal penalties, border measures, and civil remedies for intellectual property rights. The ACTA is a plurilateral agreement focused on IPR, sparking debates on scope, transparency, and inclusiveness among stakeholders. U.S. business sectors like entertainment, pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and technology support the ACTA for international IPR protection. However, concerns are raised by Internet service providers and civil society groups regarding digital enforcement provisions and implications of the agreement. Health and consumer rights advocates have raised concerns about the implications of the ACTA for trade in legitimate goods, consumer privacy, and free flow of information. The agreement initially focused on combating counterfeit goods but later broadened to include piracy, sparking debates on the rationale behind creating a new agreement to combat counterfeiting and piracy. The ACTA negotiations involved differing views on including patents in civil enforcement. The EU argued for their inclusion to benefit industries like automotive and pharmaceuticals, while the US opposed it due to concerns about contradicting US patent law. The final ACTA text allows parties to exclude patents from civil enforcement, with the US stating it will do so. The EU and the United States had differing views on including trademarks in the digital enforcement section of the ACTA. The EU supported including trademarks due to concerns about Internet sales infringing on European trademarks, while the US opposed it, possibly due to conflicting with US law. The final ACTA text mainly focuses on copyright infringement over digital networks, excluding trademark counterfeiting. The ACTA negotiation process has been criticized for lacking transparency and public input. Critics argue that governments consulted closely with right holders but not with consumer and public interest groups. The level of secrecy in the negotiations was unprecedented compared to other trade agreements. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders have called for increased transparency in the ACTA negotiations. During early ACTA negotiations, USTR faced criticism for lack of transparency. Senators called for public review of proposals, but USTR cited security reasons for not disclosing draft text. USTR shared digital enforcement chapter with cleared advisors and selected groups under non-disclosure agreements. Transparency improved as negotiations progressed, with USTR releasing a summary of key elements. USTR increased transparency during ACTA negotiations by releasing summaries of key elements, draft texts, and finalized texts at various stages. They also established a dedicated ACTA web page, released public agendas before negotiating rounds, and consulted with Congress and stakeholders. During ACTA negotiations, USTR consulted with Congress, stakeholders, and a broad range of experts to ensure congressional perspectives were reflected. The absence of developing country participation in the plurilateral agreement was controversial, with concerns raised about the impact on developing countries' interests and rights. China and India expressed concerns at WTO TRIPS Council meetings that the ACTA could weaken the balance of rights and obligations. The ACTA has raised concerns about weakening rights and obligations negotiated in WTO agreements, creating trade barriers, limiting flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, and impacting government's freedom to allocate resources for IPR enforcement. Some observers question the participation of countries with inadequate IPR protection in the ACTA. The 2012 Special 301 Report included Canada, Mexico, Finland, and Romania. Participation in the ACTA may help countries enhance IPR enforcement, but the effectiveness of the agreement is also questioned. Some observers question the effectiveness of the ACTA agreement without China and Russia. The agreement allows for expansion to include other countries after the signatory period. Developing countries may feel pressured to join for trade benefits, but critics worry they will join after the agreement is finalized. The ACTA negotiation has sparked debate over the impact of increased IPR protection on trade and consumer activities. IPR-based industries support the ACTA for economic growth, while some groups fear it may hinder legitimate trade and consumer rights. Negotiating parties assure that the ACTA respects public health and fundamental rights, with safeguards against trade barriers. The USTR stated that the ACTA will not infringe on signatories' rights and will align with WTO agreements. The ACTA negotiation has sparked debate over its potential impact on consumer privacy and the free flow of information. Critics are concerned about digital enforcement provisions that could lead to ISPs terminating customers' Internet accounts after allegations of copyright infringement. This has been controversial in the European Union, where some view Internet access as a fundamental human right that should only be terminated by judges. Some argue for increased ISP involvement in IPR enforcement to combat online piracy, while critics believe it places undue burdens on ISPs. Concerns have been raised about the low threshold for terminating consumers' Internet access based on allegations of piracy. Legislation like the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA have sparked debate, with some worried about the impact on U.S. \"fair use\" practices under an agreement like ACTA. The final ACTA text does not include provisions for a \"three-strikes\" rule or \"notice-and-takedown\" rules. Instead, it allows authorities to order ISPs to disclose information to identify alleged infringers. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on legitimate trade and border enforcement. Border enforcement provisions in the ACTA allow governments to grant customs officials ex-officio authority to seize goods suspected of infringing IPR. Some countries do not currently empower their customs officials with this authority, while others do so in limited cases. In the United States, the CBP can seize goods violating copyrights and trademarks but not for patent violations. Granting customs officials ex-officio authority is seen as crucial by many business groups to combat counterfeit and pirated goods effectively. Critics argue against this, citing concerns about potential impacts on legitimate trade and border enforcement. The ACTA negotiation included discussions on border enforcement provisions, including whether to include patents. Critics raised concerns about potential delays in trade, increased costs, and impediments to personal travel. Public health advocates worried about the impact on legitimate generic medicines trade. The final ACTA text specified in a footnote that patents and protection were included in the border enforcement section. The ACTA's final text excludes patents and undisclosed information from the border enforcement section, focusing on trademarks and copyrights. Negotiated outside of existing multilateral frameworks, the ACTA aims to advance global IPR protection efficiently. Stalled multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO and WIPO have led to the ACTA's standalone approach generating debate. The ACTA negotiating parties believe the agreement is innovative and not fitting under current multilateral frameworks. Critics argue that holding negotiations outside existing frameworks bypasses concerns of developing countries. There are questions about the ACTA's long-term status and the possibility of it being incorporated by the WTO or other international bodies. Japanese trade officials see the ACTA as a potential model for international rules within the WTO framework. Supporters argue that the ACTA enhances IPR protection and enforcement, filling gaps in current frameworks, especially in the digital environment. They believe that a strong coalition of countries supporting the ACTA could send a powerful message about the importance of global IPR protection. The ACTA is seen as a potential model for international rules within the WTO framework. Critics argue that it may overlap with existing international agreements on IPR enforcement. Some question the need for new trade agreements when current mechanisms are underutilized. Others doubt the effectiveness of government-to-government agreements without increased legal protections. The ACTA is viewed as a potential model for international rules within the WTO framework. Critics argue that it may overlap with existing international agreements on IPR enforcement. Some question the need for new trade agreements when current mechanisms are underutilized. Others doubt the effectiveness of government-to-government agreements without increased legal protections. Shortcomings in enforcing laws exist, and the ACTA could address these gaps. It may not change U.S. law but could impact global intellectual property protection, prompting other countries to adjust their laws. The role of Congress in ACTA approval and potential constitutional issues may arise. The ACTA raises questions about its impact on congressional action, national priorities, and allocation of federal funds. It aims to address commercial losses and health concerns from IPR infringement. Prioritizing forms of infringement with limited resources and potential implications for U.S. trade policy are key considerations. The ACTA may set a precedent for IPR protection outside of multilateral frameworks and could influence future trade negotiations. The ACTA raises questions about its impact on congressional action, national priorities, and allocation of federal funds. Would accession to the ACTA be a requirement for signatories to future U.S. regional and bilateral FTAs? Given the European Parliament's rejection of the ACTA, what are the prospects for the ACTA entering into force?"
