    "content": "The \"Brownfield Redevelopment Reserve Act\" may be cited as the Brownfields IRA, which includes special rules for hazardous waste remediation reserves under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Brownfield Redevelopment Reserve Act, also known as the Brownfields IRA, allows deductions for payments made to a Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve. The taxpayer's payments into the Reserve are limited to $1,000,000 per year. Any distributions from the Reserve are included in the taxpayer's gross income, and qualified hazardous waste costs are deductible when economic performance occurs. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve is a tax-exempt reserve established by the taxpayer for qualified hazardous waste costs. Contributions to the reserve are deductible, and it can only accept payments that are tax-deductible. The reserve can be used for remediation purposes. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve is exclusively used to pay the taxpayer's qualified hazardous waste costs. The Reserve is subject to regulations against self-dealing and may be disqualified for violations. If funds are not spent within 10 years of establishment, they are deemed distributed. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve must be used solely for qualified hazardous waste costs. If funds are not used for this purpose within 10 years of establishment, a penalty of 10 percent applies to any amount distributed. Qualified hazardous waste costs are defined in the section. The term 'qualified hazardous waste costs' refers to costs related to assessing environmental contamination and remediation, as well as costs incurred for remediation. Controlled groups are treated as one entity for tax purposes, and payments to the Reserve are deemed made at the end of the taxable year. The table of sections for subpart C of part II of subchapter E of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by inserting a new item after section 468B. The amendments made by section 468C regarding hazardous waste remediation reserves will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act."
