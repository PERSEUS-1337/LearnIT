    "title": "AB 1534",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares the need for county assessors to follow state laws for consistent assessment practices. They aim to protect taxpayers by ensuring decisions on property exemptions and ownership changes are made by certified staff. Implementation of education and certification requirements will be done efficiently with existing resources. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended and renumbered to 681. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to Section 681, requiring competitive bids for appraisal work contracts and maintaining confidentiality of assessee information. Contractors must obtain written authorization from the assessor before requesting information from an assessee. A contractor must not share appraisal data with assessors or contractors from other counties not involved in the contract. Assessors can share data with assessors from other counties. Contractors must not keep an assessee's confidential information after the contract ends and must return all records to the assessor within 90 days. Contracts must include provisions for these requirements as prescribed by the State Board of Equalization. Article 8.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires assessors and their employees to hold a valid assessment analyst certificate to make decisions on changes in ownership and property tax exemptions. The board administers examinations for assessment analyst certificates, with input from a committee of assessors. Certificates are only issued to those who pass the exam and demonstrate competency in making ownership or exemption decisions. Applicants denied a certificate can request a review. This requirement does not apply to assessors holding valid appraiser's certificates. The board does not charge counties or applicants for examinations or training. Certified assessment analysts must complete 24 hours of board-approved training annually to maintain their certificate. Excess training hours can be carried over for up to three years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation. Training covers new developments in case law, statutory law, and administrative rules. The board issues an advanced assessment analyst certificate to applicants with at least three years of experience who have completed an advanced course of study or passed an advanced level examination. To maintain the certificate, holders must complete 12 hours of training annually, with excess hours carried over for up to two years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation. Failure to complete training may lead to revocation of the advanced assessment analyst certificate, with proceedings conducted according to the Administrative Procedure Act. Training for certificate retention includes staying updated on new legal developments. Applicants must disclose financial interests in legal entities at certification and annually thereafter. Duplicate filings with the Fair Political Practices Commission can fulfill this requirement. The board may issue temporary and interim certificates to assessors or employees of the county assessor's office for up to one year and four years respectively, to allow them to apply for and take an examination for certification. Temporary certificates are for newly elected or appointed individuals, while interim certificates are for current assessors or employees making ownership or exemption decisions. Renewal of temporary or interim certificates is not allowed unless the individual has been duly elected or appointed to the assessor's office. This article allows assessors to efficiently manage staff resources for noncertificated staff to handle exemption applications and ownership documents, as long as they do not make final decisions. It applies only in counties that have passed a resolution requiring certification."
