    "content": "The \"Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011\" includes temporary payroll tax relief for employers, employees, and the self-employed. The \"Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011\" provides temporary payroll tax relief by reducing the tax rates on remuneration during the payroll tax holiday period to 3.1 percent under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for qualified employers and employees. During the payroll tax holiday period, the rate of self-employment tax under section 1401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 6.2 percent on net earnings up to $5 million over total remuneration subject to section 3111(a), and 9.3 percent on any additional net earnings. During the payroll tax holiday period, deductions for self-employment taxes are calculated based on a percentage of net earnings, with different rates for earnings above a certain threshold. During the payroll tax holiday period in 2012, deductions for self-employment taxes are calculated based on a percentage of net earnings, with different rates for earnings above a certain threshold. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe regulations for the allocation of excess amounts over total remuneration among related taxpayers treated as a single qualified employer. A qualified employer, for this purpose, excludes the United States, any State or possession, political subdivision, or instrumentality thereof. The text discusses the treatment of employees of post-secondary educational institutions as qualified employers under certain conditions. It also mentions aggregation rules for determining when multiple entities are considered a single employer. Additionally, it talks about transfers of funds to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The text discusses the appropriation of funds to the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account for employers subject to the Railroad Retirement Tax to offset revenue reductions. Transfers are made from the general fund to replicate the Trust Fund transfers that would have occurred without the enacted amendments. The text discusses the coordination of the rate of tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with other Federal laws, without considering the reduction in tax rate under the enacted amendments. SEC. 102. TEMPORARY TAX CREDIT FOR INCREASED PAYROLL. SEC. 102. TEMPORARY TAX CREDIT FOR INCREASED PAYROLL. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, qualified employers are allowed a payroll increase credit for wages from October 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011, and January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. For calendar year 2012, qualified employers with zero wages in 2010 and 2011 are eligible for a payroll increase credit of 80% of wages from October 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011, and 2012. This applies to employees in a trade or business of the employer or related activities for tax-exempt employers. Qualified employers, excluding certain entities, are eligible for a payroll increase credit. Rules for determining multiple entities as a single employer apply, and credits are applicable for specific timeframes. The payroll increase credit is treated as a credit under the Internal Revenue Code, limited to the tax imposed on the employer. Any income tax deduction for amounts paid under the Code shall be reduced by the credited amounts. Appropriations are made to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund to offset revenue reductions due to these amendments. The amendments aim to replicate transfers to the Trust Fund, with specific application to Railroad Retirement Taxes by substituting terms and sections accordingly. TITLE II--SURTAX ON MILLIONAIRES\n\nSEC. 201. SURTAX ON MILLIONAIRES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new part for a surtax on millionaires. A surtax of 3.25% is imposed on taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000 ($500,000 for married individuals filing separately) starting after 2012. Dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation annually. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income minus any deduction allowed for investment interest. Special rules apply for nonresident alien individuals and citizens/residents living abroad. The tax imposed under this section shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, such as determining the amount of any credit under this chapter or for purposes of section 55. The surtax on millionaires amendment does not change the tax rate for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2012."
