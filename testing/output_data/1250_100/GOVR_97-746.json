However, a 2009 report showed a significant increase in foreign-born students, with a notable rise from China. New foreign student enrollment also increased, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. Enrollment changes varied by institution, study level, and discipline, with differences in student flow from different regions like India. In 2008-2009, India's students made up 15.4% of the foreign student population in the U.S., followed by China (14.6%) and South Korea (11.2%). The top fields of study for foreign students were business, engineering, and physical sciences. Foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering, with higher rates for those on temporary resident visas. In 2006, foreign students (temporary and permanent resident status) earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the physical sciences, mathematics, computer sciences, earth sciences, and biological sciences. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various fields. The NSF provides data on the country of origin of foreign-born science and engineering doctorate awardees, with China, India, and Taiwan being the top three countries. Foreign graduate students in the US face restrictions on employment and financial aid but can work as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. Foreign and U.S. science and engineering graduate students receive financial support from various sources, including personal funds, university assistantships, and research grants. While temporary resident foreign students are not eligible for direct federal aid, universities often provide support through research and teaching assistantships funded by federal grants. Foreign and U.S. science and engineering graduate students receive financial support from various sources, including personal funds, university assistantships, and research grants. A greater percentage of non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients receive financial assistance from universities than U.S. doctoral recipients. Data by race/ethnicity shows that Native Americans/Alaska Natives rely on their own resources the most, followed by blacks, whites, Hispanics, and Asians. In the physical sciences and engineering, universities provide primary financial support for temporary resident students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens. In the field of education, a higher percentage of foreign doctoral students on visas received financial support from universities compared to U.S. students. There are differing opinions on the impact of foreign student presence in science and engineering programs, with some arguing that it benefits U.S. universities and economy. Foreign students contribute to the skilled workforce and bring measurable costs and benefits. Foreign students play a significant role in the workforce at educational institutions, especially in research universities. They assist in teaching classes, conducting research, and contribute to lab work. Additionally, their tuition fees are a crucial source of income for these institutions. However, their prominent presence in graduate programs has sparked concerns among minority groups who feel that there is unequal access to opportunities in the science community. Colleges and universities are criticized for favoring foreign students over minority graduate students, leading to inadequate support for African American doctoral students. Concerns also arise about communication barriers between foreign teaching assistants and American students due to accented English. The proficiency of foreign teaching assistants in English is a concern for graduate schools, with some states setting language standards. However, proponents argue that international knowledge exchange benefits the U.S. economy. The participation of international graduate students and scholars is crucial for research activities, and their presence is essential for maintaining cutting-edge science and technology in the country. In the 1990s, the number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the United States increased significantly due to changes in immigration laws. The proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force reached a record high in 2000, with high levels of entry through permanent and temporary visas. Administrative changes, immigration legislation, and the impact of September 11th have influenced the issuance of permanent visas in recent years. Foreign scientists and engineers on temporary work visas have sparked debate, with the H-1B program seeing an increase in annual quotas for foreign-born workers. The H-1B program has increased the annual quota for foreign-born workers to obtain visas for up to six years, not just for technology workers but also other skilled workers. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers has led to depressed job opportunities and lowered wages for U.S. workers. The federal government has issued thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers, leading to concerns about weakening opportunities for the U.S. workforce. Many U.S. workers criticize the hiring of foreign labor at lower salaries, advocating for restrictions on hiring foreign skilled employees. Supporters of the H-1B program argue that foreign workers are necessary to fill needed positions, even during slow economic growth. The Government Accountability Office found limitations in Labor's review of H-1B applications and enforcement of program requirements. Labor's Wage and Hour Division investigates complaints against H-1B employers and conducts random investigations of program violators. The USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, hindering investigations of H-1B program violations. Justice pursues charges of discriminatory hiring practices but often finds no wrongdoing. Concerns exist about lower salaries for foreign computer professionals compared to U.S. workers, impacting the bargaining power of the latter. The Department of Labor enforces policies on H-1B visas to penalize violators. The United States needs skilled nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas to compete in the global economy. Monitoring foreign talent entering U.S. colleges and universities is crucial. Attracting and retaining foreign-born talent in STEM fields is essential for the nation's competitiveness. The debate on the presence of foreign students in STEM programs and workforce in the US intensified after 9/11. Concerns have been raised about the inhospitable environment for foreign students and the US losing its status as a preferred destination. Issues include access to sensitive areas for education and training, as well as foreign scientists' access to R&D related to chemical and biological weapons. The academic community is concerned about the impact of more stringent requirements for foreign students on college enrollments. There are debates on how a possible reduction in foreign scientists immigrating to the US could affect the competitiveness of the US industry and international cooperative agreements. The tracking of foreign students attending US institutions has been a topic of debate since the September 11th attacks, with legislation like the SEVP/CIPRIS system being implemented to monitor foreign students and researchers. The legislation required colleges and universities to monitor and compile data on foreign students attending their institutions, but the system was never fully implemented due to cost and concerns about burden. The USA Patriot Act and Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act enhanced the process with the development of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to track foreign students and exchange visitors in the US. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was implemented to track foreign students in the US, but faced delays and technical issues. A proposal for SEVIS II aims to address these problems and enhance the tracking system. Congressional hearings have focused on strengthening the visa process for security while facilitating legitimate travel. Witnesses testified about the challenges in visa processing, including increased workloads, lack of resources, and data availability. The Government Accountability Office has released reports on improvements in visa operations, highlighting the need for clear procedures to ensure consistent adjudication of visas. Reports also identified ongoing issues that require immediate attention. The recommendations for improving the visa application system include clarifying policies and procedures, providing consular officers with necessary tools for national security, and promoting legitimate travel. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation was debated in the 110th Congress but failed. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 4321 was introduced for comprehensive immigration reform, which would exempt certain U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based limits and amend H-1B visa requirements. Other bills in the 111th Congress aim to attract foreign students in scientific and technical fields. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to attract foreign students in scientific and technical fields. H.R. 1736, International Science and Technology Cooperation Act, addresses issues impacting collaboration between U.S. and foreign scientists. S. 887, H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, limits H-1B and L-1 employees for employers with 50 or more workers. H.R. 1791, STAPLE Act, sets numerical limits on immigrants with U.S. doctorates in scientific fields and job offers in related fields."
