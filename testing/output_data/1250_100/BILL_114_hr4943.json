    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2016\". The Congress recognizes the unique relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, acknowledging tribes' authority to provide programs and services, develop economies, and maintain infrastructure on reservation lands. Federal laws and treaties affirm tribes as governments with the power to tax, issue bonds, and receive tax exemptions. Tax parity for tribal governments aligns with their sovereignty, addressing historic capital access challenges. Indian tribes face challenges in accessing capital for infrastructure and job creation, hindered by statutory restrictions on governance. They are sometimes excluded from key provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, leading to unfair tax treatment. Congress has the authority to regulate commerce with tribes, aiming to promote tribal self-governance and affirm the government-to-government relationship. Indian tribes are treated as states with respect to bond issuance. Indian tribal governments are subject to special rules for tax-exempt bonds, with the Secretary of the Treasury establishing a national bond volume cap based on tribal population estimates. The cap is then allocated among tribal governments seeking an allocation in a particular year. The amendment repeals certain requirements for Indian tribal governments regarding tax-exempt bonds, with new regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The effective date applies to obligations issued in specific calendar years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. Treatment of pension and employee benefit plans maintained by tribal governments.
