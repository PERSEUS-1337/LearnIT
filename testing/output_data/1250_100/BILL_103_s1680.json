    "content": "The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" establishes a uniform indoor air policy for public facilities regarding environmental tobacco smoke. It amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to include Title V, which defines the purpose and standards for indoor air quality in relation to tobacco smoke. The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" defines key terms such as environmental tobacco smoke, public facility, and responsible entity. It establishes a uniform indoor air policy for public facilities regarding tobacco smoke. The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" requires public facilities to adopt a uniform indoor air policy prohibiting environmental tobacco smoke and posting notices about the prohibition. Specially designated smoking areas are an exception to this policy. The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" mandates public facilities to have a uniform indoor air policy banning environmental tobacco smoke. Specially designated smoking areas can be allowed if they meet specific ventilation requirements and do not require nonsmoking individuals to enter. The \"Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1993\" allows public facilities to request waivers from the Administrator for compliance with the indoor air policy banning smoking. Waivers can be granted for up to 1 year if unusual circumstances prevent compliance, with a requirement to protect nonsmokers to the maximum extent possible. Petitions and actions taken by the Administrator are published in the Federal Register, and an annual report on waivers granted is submitted to Congress. \"SEC. 504. ENFORCEMENT.\" Penalties for non-compliance with section 503 include a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per day of violation. The court can allocate these penalties towards projects aligned with the title's purpose. Actions to enforce section 503 can be initiated by aggrieved parties, government agencies, or the Administrator, with a 60-day notice requirement before legal action. An aggrieved person cannot sue under this section if the alleged violator complies with section 503 within 60 days. Venue for actions related to section 503 violations can be in a US district court where the defendant resides or does business. The court can award costs of litigation, including attorney fees, to a prevailing plaintiff in such actions. SEC. 505 states that this title does not override other laws protecting from environmental tobacco smoke hazards. SEC. 506 allows the Administrator to issue necessary regulations. Effective one year after enactment."
