    "content": "The Act titled \"John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007\" amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include loan repayment for prosecutors and public defenders. Grant authorization is provided under this new section. The section aims to incentivize qualified individuals to work as prosecutors and public defenders. A prosecutor is a licensed attorney who handles criminal cases at the state or local level, while a public defender is a licensed attorney providing legal representation to indigent persons in criminal cases. A defender attorney in a defender organization provides legal representation to indigent persons in criminal cases. The term 'student loan' includes loans under various parts of the Higher Education Act of 1965, excluding specific types of loans. The Attorney General will establish a program for repaying student loans for prosecutors and public defenders who are not in default, requiring a minimum 3-year service commitment. The borrower must repay benefits if separated from employment due to misconduct or voluntarily before the agreement period ends. Failure to repay will result in the Federal Government recovering the amount owed. The Attorney General has the discretion to waive recovery if it goes against equity or public interest. The Attorney General will make student loan payments under this section for the agreement period, subject to appropriations. Any repayments by the borrower will be credited back to the original account. Repayments will be subject to terms set by the Attorney General. The Attorney General will make student loan payments under this section for the agreement period, subject to agreed-upon terms and limitations. The maximum amount paid by the Attorney General shall not exceed $10,000 per borrower per calendar year or an aggregate total of $60,000. Repayments made by the borrower prior to the agreement with the Attorney General will not be reimbursed. Upon completion of the required service period, the borrower and the Attorney General may enter into additional agreements. The Attorney General can enter into additional agreements with borrowers, requiring them to work as prosecutors or public defenders for less than 3 years. Repayment benefits are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to borrowers who have completed less than 3 years of service. The Attorney General is authorized to issue regulations. The Attorney General can issue regulations to carry out the provisions of this section. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funds for each succeeding year."
