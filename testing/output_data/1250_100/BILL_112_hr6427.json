The \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" establishes a Job Training Resources Grant Program under Section 403(a) of the Social Security Act. This program provides grants for the purchase, renovation, construction, or lease of real property for qualified self-sustaining job programs that offer job training and employment services to individuals with employment challenges. The Job Training Resources Grant Program under the \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" gives priority to eligible applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs. Applicants can participate in other Federal programs. Eligible applicants include national organizations and local organizations with grants under section 413(h)(3)(A). The Job Training Resources Grant Program prioritizes eligible applicants with experience in self-sustaining job programs. Eligible applicants include national organizations, State or political subdivisions, and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Grants are conditioned on establishing job placement performance goals. The grantee receiving funds must operate a job program with performance assessment dates set by the Secretary. The Secretary must protect the federal interest in real property purchased with grant funds. Subawards are also allowed for eligible applicants. The eligible applicant receiving funds must distribute them among local member organizations for self-sustaining job programs. $200,000,000 is appropriated for grants in fiscal year 2013. A penalty is imposed for failing to meet job placement goals in the program. If a recipient of funds fails to meet job placement goals, they must repay the funds to the Treasury. Repayment is spread over 10 years with no interest. Alternatively, they can comply with the goals with the Secretary's consent. The text discusses penalties for states failing to comply with job placement goals and the option to reduce grants instead of making payments. Additionally, it mentions an exclusion from the state reasonable cause exception under the Social Security Act. [SEC. 3. OFFSET TO ENSURE PAYGO COMPLIANCE.]"
