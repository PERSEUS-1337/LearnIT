It establishes the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing Program.

Eligibility requires submission of a master plan meeting specific requirements and certification from the Environmental Protection Agency. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program guarantees loans for brownfield redevelopment projects. Loans must be used for site acquisition, remediation, relocation of facilities, and site preparation. Eligibility requires a master plan meeting specific requirements and certification from the Environmental Protection Agency. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program sets restrictions on loan guarantees for contaminated sites. Only one outstanding loan is allowed per agency, with a principal amount between $25,000,000 and $150,000,000. Interest rates are negotiated between the lender and the agency. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program allows for loan guarantees with negotiated interest rates and a term to maturity of 20-30 years. Repayment of principal and interest is not required within 10 years, with repayment starting no later than 15 years after the loan is made. The master plan for the project funded by the loan must include a description of activities, budget, and demonstration of brownfield redevelopment. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development program requires a budget and demonstration of major redevelopment impact on the community, including non-Federal funds, job creation, environmental remediation, affordable housing, reduced vehicle emissions, green technology integration, and improved air quality. The selection criteria for receiving loan guarantees under the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development program include evidence of non-Federal investment commitments, incorporation of complete streets planning and transit-oriented development, and an approved remediation action plan. Existing projects with Federal assistance will receive favorable consideration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to guarantee payments under this section, providing conclusive evidence of eligibility for obligations. The Federal Government is protected from liability for environmental remediation under this program. The Secretary will process loan guarantee requests using a similar approval process as other housing development programs. Before final approval of any loan guarantee under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the Secretary must notify relevant Congressional committees. Eligibility for a loan guarantee requires a viable repayment schedule and sufficient collateral, which can be in the form of grants under the same Act. The Secretary cannot mandate a pledge of such grants as collateral and must allow other forms of collateral at the applicant's discretion. Definitions for the section include BRAC redevelopment project, brownfield, local redevelopment agency, and remediation action plan. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of terms like \"plan,\" \"Program,\" and \"Secretary\" in relation to a brownfield redevelopment project. It also mentions the issuance of regulations by the Secretary and the authorization of appropriations for the Program."
