    "content": "The \"Improved Vaccine Supply Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a new section on adequate vaccine supply. The \"Improved Vaccine Supply Act\" mandates the development of a plan for purchasing, storing, and rotating a supply of vaccines for children and adults to cover a 6-month period. This includes all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other vaccines designated by the Secretary for public health. The Secretary is required to submit a plan for vaccine supply authority to relevant committees within 6 months of enactment. The plan must discuss the purchasing, storing, and rotating of vaccines for public health preparedness efforts. The plan for vaccine supply authority must include discussions on the basis for the plan and the prioritization of vaccine purchasing schedules. The Secretary is required to fully implement the plan by September 30, 2008. Manufacturers must provide at least 1 year notice to the Secretary before discontinuing vaccine production, with the option to reduce the notice period with good cause certification. The manufacturer certifies good cause for reduction under section 506C(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Proceeds from vaccine sales go towards purchasing additional vaccines. The Secretary must submit ongoing reports detailing plan progress and any impediments. The manufacturer certifies good cause for reduction under section 506C(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Reports must include recommendations on extending vaccine supply and discussions on the reasons behind the recommendations. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 through 2012."
