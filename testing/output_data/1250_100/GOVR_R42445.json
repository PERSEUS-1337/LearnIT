    "content": "The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009. Since then, programs have operated on extension acts and resolutions due to constrained financial resources. The highway trust fund, funded by highway taxes, has seen declining revenues. Passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit is a key issue in the ongoing debate. The ongoing debate revolves around issues such as alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management in the context of federal spending distribution among states. The Senate passed MAP-21 on March 14, 2012, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, is a five-year bill providing for a total. H.R. 7 is a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion, linking surface transportation reauthorization with provisions for oil and gas production. It includes controversial measures like discontinuing mass transit funding from Highway Trust Fund revenues. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend authorizations through FY2012, with additional provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline and environmental streamlining. The Senate agreed to an amendment on H.R. 4348, replacing it with the language of MAP-21 to send the measure to conference. Negotiations will involve the substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex due to multiple committees involved. The highway trust fund is mainly funded by excise taxes on motor fuels. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with gasoline taxed at 18.4 cents per gallon and diesel at 24.3 cents per gallon. The fund consists of two accounts - highway and mass transit. The highway account receives 15.44 cents of the gasoline tax, while the mass transit account receives 2.86 cents. Due to stagnant fuel tax rates since 1993 and factors like economic slowdown and improved vehicle fuel efficiency, revenues have fallen short. The highway account has required transfers from the general fund to cover shortfalls, with a projected shortfall of $4.6 billion by the end of FY2013 according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Highway Trust Fund faces a yearly gap of $8 to $9 billion through FY2022. The mass transit account is projected to have a shortfall of $1.2 billion by the end of FY2014, increasing to $5 billion by the end of FY2015. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund will struggle to support transportation spending, leading policymakers to consider new revenue sources or a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program encompasses various programs administered by FHWA with consistent financial and administrative attributes. The Highway Program is primarily state-run, with state DOTs determining spending and complying with federal guidelines. Federally funded projects require a local matching share, with different percentages for Interstate System and other roads. FHWA manages fund distribution through notifications, apportionment, allocation, and reimbursement processes. The highway program has statutory distribution formulas for reimbursement once a project is approved and work is started. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation, with the federal government legally committing to reimburse states for project costs. Limitation on obligations controls annual spending, and there are formula and discretionary programs for fund allocation among states. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ, HSIP, and EB. Each program has its own formula factors to determine state funding. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas, diluting the policy rationales of core program formulas. Some state DOTs argue that programmatic structure limits their use of federal highway funds as they see fit. Smaller discretionary highway programs are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program. During SAFETEA, federal transit programs were administered by FHWA and FTA, with different funding mechanisms and rules. Four main programs accounted for 85% of transit funding, with two programs distributing funds by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program, the largest program, provided funding to urbanized areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA accounts for 41% of authorized transit funding and provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Funds can be used for various expenses including capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations in urbanized areas with populations of up to 200,000. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds, 16% of authorized transit funding, are mainly for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program, making up 18% of overall authorized transit funding, is available on a competitive basis for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. Congress also enacted a \"Small Starts\" program to fund projects with a total cost of $250 million or less. The Small Starts projects are funded with $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization. Bus Program funds, 9% of authorized funding, are used to purchase buses and related equipment. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities in the US, with federal programs assisting states in improving highway safety. The Department of Transportation (DOT) administers highway safety programs through three agencies: NHTSA for driver behavior and vehicle safety, FMCSA for commercial driver qualifications and vehicle safety, and FHWA for roadway design safety. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and requires states to submit highway safety plans to receive federal funds. States must identify safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures for progress. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance to states. The Department of Transportation administers highway safety programs through NHTSA, FMCSA, and FHWA. FMCSA promotes commercial vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, and grant programs. HSIP aims to reduce traffic fatalities by improving roadway design. States receive funding for safety initiatives through various grant programs. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) provides funding to states based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities. States receive a minimum of 0.5% of the program's funding. SAFETEA extended funding guarantees and created budget categories to protect highway and mass transit funds from being reallocated. The Budget Enforcement Act guarantees for highway funding were honored until 2002. The House rule protecting funding levels was eliminated in the 112th Congress. The RABA mechanism adjusts funding based on actual receipts, but Congress has never cut spending despite revenue shortfalls. Recent years saw general fund transfers supplementing the Highway Trust Fund, making RABA calculations moot. However, future reauthorization may consider mechanisms to align spending with receipts. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 likely mean that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending authorized beyond FY2012. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety Operations, Transit Formula and Bus Grants. Annual contract authority of $739 million may be subject to sequester. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 likely mean that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending authorized beyond FY2012. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program, supported with general fund revenues, appears to be subject to sequester. SAFETEA expired on September 30, 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II is an authorization extension of the HTF and federal surface transportation programs through September 30, 2012. The Senate agreed to substitute the full text of MAP-21 for the House-passed language, enabling the measure to go to conference. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica has stated that negotiation will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7. The negotiation on H.R. 4348 will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7. Provisions in conference proposals must fall within the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Conference reports with out-of-scope provisions may face points of order in both chambers. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act. Waivers can be granted in the House with a majority vote and in the Senate with the support of 60 Senators. The Access Act (H.R. 3548) transfers permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, requiring a permit within 30 days. It establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund financed by Deepwater Horizon-related penalties, with distribution to Gulf Coast states, restoration council, and research. The House-passed H.R. 4348 would distribute revenue from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, with 60% going to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council and 5% for research. Unlike S. 1400, a future act of Congress would be required to initiate this distribution. The bill also includes provisions for harbor maintenance programs, coal combustion residuals permit programs, and transportation project delivery acceleration. Both the House and Senate bills aim to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that would reduce the number of highway programs by two-thirds and make significant changes to the structure, formulas, and funding distribution of the federal highway program. It includes a total authorization of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with $400 million allocated for research and education each fiscal year. The bill eliminates individual formula factors and apportions funds to states based on their share of total apportionments and allocations from FY2005-FY2009. This change in programmatic structure reduces federal and congressional influence on project selection. MAP-21 aims to reduce federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection by eliminating individual formula factors and reducing the number of programs by two-thirds. This shift would be achieved by transferring program eligibility to core programs and restricting transferability between programs to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. Additionally, nearly all discretionary grant programs under FHWA control would be eliminated, with the Transportation Enhancements Program rolled into the CMAQ program. The bill also introduces a National Freight Program to enhance project delivery and eligibility requirements. The National Freight Program (NFP) aims to increase funding for freight projects by eliminating competition with non-freight projects. The Senate bill proposes a significant increase in funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. However, there is limited mention of tolling on federally funded roads and bridges. H.R. 7 is a five-year reauthorization bill with modest increases for federal-aid highways and funding for research and education. The bill also consolidates existing programs into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs, reducing the overall number of distinct programs. The Equity Bonus program would reduce the number of distinct programs to around 30 and guarantee a 94% state rate of return to the HTF. The Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for mass transit and $2.267 billion annually for highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected to the Highway Account. Provisions under the streamlining title would change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total costs. TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold. MAP-21 would fund the FTA and its programs with 79.9% from the HTF and 20.1% from the general fund, providing $10.458 billion annually for FY2012-FY2013. The MAP-21 provisions include $10.458 billion annually for transit programs, creating the State of Good Repair program and modifying the New Starts process. H.R. 7 would authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. It renames the Mass Transit Account as the Alternative Transportation Account and eliminates certain programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program. Funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would be set aside from the New Starts program. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control. It amends the RRIF program for freight rail and makes changes to laws affecting rail freight. The House bill addresses Amtrak funding, RRIF program, and positive train control implementation to close the gap between projected revenues and total authorizations. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes through FY2015 and trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013. It includes provisions to raise $13.872 billion for the HTF over ten-and-a-half fiscal years, with various sources such as the LUST trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax transfer, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, Medicare provider levy, future import tariffs on automotive products, and tax treatment changes for controlled corporations. The curr_chunk discusses various revenue sources including tax treatment changes for controlled corporations, levy on federal employee's Thrift Savings Account, extension for transfers of excess pension assets, pension funding stabilization, transfer from Treasury general fund to HTF, phased retirement for federal agencies, reporting of sale of life insurance policies, extension of taxes on cigarette manufacturers, and other revenue increases totaling $18.149 billion over 10 years. The curr_chunk discusses offsets and revenue provisions totaling $5.869 billion over 10 years, including measures against money laundering and changes to bond rules. These provisions have raised comments as they exceed the needed offset for HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels, potentially allowing for deficit reduction or additional spending. The curr_chunk discusses provisions including extending the parity of monthly exclusion for employer-provided benefits, incorporating the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act, and authorizing states to issue TRIP bonds. It also includes changes to the depreciation period for highway leases and franchise rights to collect tolls. The Finance Committee expresses concerns about current law regarding amortization periods. The Finance Committee is concerned about the disparity between the amortization period for highway toll rights and lease terms. A \"solvency account\" would be established to manage excess funds for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund to generate revenue for the highway trust fund. The LUST trust fund was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum. It is funded by a tax on gasoline and diesel fuels and supports environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. The fund has been used by states to oversee corrective actions by responsible parties and conduct cleanup in emergencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded its use for federal UST leak prevention and detection programs. Over 85% of reported releases have been addressed, leaving a backlog of 88,000. In FY2012, the LUST trust fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million annually from the trust fund, with states receiving a minimum of 80% as grants. Section 40301 of the Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Section 40302 suggests appropriating one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts from the gasoline and diesel fuel tax to the highway trust fund. The Senate bill proposes transferring funds from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund, with projections of annual transfers ranging from $62 million to $67 million. The bill also extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority and reconfigures the highway trust fund, requiring future transfers to be fully offset in budget authority and outlays. The House bill, H.R. 7, aims to reconfigure the Highway Trust Fund by filling revenue gaps and proposing a new allocation of government receipts from energy leasing and production activities. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not transfer funds from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund but extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions separately, with the potential for incorporation into H.R. 7. The House bill, H.R. 7, focuses on reconfiguring the Highway Trust Fund and proposing a new allocation of government receipts from energy leasing and production activities. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act administers offshore energy development, allowing the Department of the Interior to lease rights for oil and gas resources in federal ocean areas. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion in FY2011, with allocations to various programs including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. H.R. 7 also renames the mass transit account of the HTF to the alternative transportation account. The Senate bill, MAP-21, reallocates funds from the mass transit account to the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund, providing a one-time appropriation of $40 billion for alternative transportation. It proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, eliminates the Equity Bonus Program, and guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA with a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. MAP-21 does not include highway program earmarks and includes provisions for highway spending controls to ensure the solvency of the HTF. The \"ratchet mechanism\" provision in the MAP-21 bill aims to maintain the solvency of the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund by adjusting distribution to states if the account balance falls below certain thresholds. This provision is related to the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels and may increase pressure to identify additional revenue options for the HTF. The ratchet mechanism in the HTF faces resistance in Congress due to past negative RABA calculations. Despite this, H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program over five years. It includes an Alternative Transportation Account for additional funding and does not have spending guarantee mechanisms like SAFETEA. H.R. 7 includes a modified Equity Bonus Program guaranteeing each state's highway grants to equal at least 94% of fuel taxes paid. The bill funds various highway programs, allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system, and does not include earmarks. MAP-21 does not set specific authorization levels for core programs. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. Initial amounts are calculated based on total available funds and state shares from previous years. Adjustments are made to ensure each state receives at least 95% of estimated tax payments. A portion is set aside for the CMAQ program based on state percentages. The MAP-21 legislation determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. Initial amounts are calculated based on total available funds and state shares from previous years, with adjustments made to ensure each state receives at least 95% of estimated tax payments. A portion is set aside for the CMAQ program based on state percentages, and the remaining amount is divided among core programs including NHPP, TMP, HSIP, and NFP. Further adjustments may be made based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. The FHWA adjusts state apportionments based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. This results in reduced apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, while increasing apportionments for other states. The MAP-21 legislation lacks an overt equity program like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program. MAP-21 does not have an explicit equity program. It determines the \"initial amount\" for each state based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009 to address donor-donee issues. There is an adjustment mechanism to ensure states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary. Some states prefer using state return on payments to the HTF to determine the \"initial amount\" due to earmarking legacy issues from SAFETEA. The earmarking system under SAFETEA was divided into \"below the line\" and \"above the line\" categories, with the latter increasing funds to receiving states. While MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks, states that previously received above-the-line earmarks continued to benefit from higher base amounts. The unequal distribution of earmarks among Members of Congress and states was controversial, with some states receiving favorable apportionment shares under MAP-21 due to their past success in obtaining earmarks. MAP-21 reduces funding programs by two-thirds to around 30 programs, absorbing their eligibilities into new core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP, the largest program, would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013, supporting the improvement of the National Highway System. The program combines three SAFETEA core programs to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure improvement. The NHPP program focuses on improving infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes projects for highway segments, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics. Funds may be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) would transfer funds from specified programs to assist states and localities in improving federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads. It replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, excluding the 10% Transportation Enhancement set-aside. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects, including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, and recreational trails. Additionally, funds can be used for natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to transportation projects. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) reallocates funds to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads, replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects, including transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, and recreational trails. Additionally, funds can be used for natural habitat and wetlands conservation and mitigation plans. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program would be eliminated, giving states more flexibility in determining spending on ADHS routes and access roads. Under MAP-21, the CMAQ program would receive roughly $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects. The HSIP program would remain largely unchanged, supporting safety improvements on road infrastructure. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished, with their project eligibilities retained. The NFP program would be introduced to enhance national freight performance. The program aims to enhance the national freight network with an annual budget of $2 billion for FY2012 and FY2013. MAP-21 would limit state funding transfers between programs, but with overlapping eligibility areas, reducing the need for transfers. H.R. 7 proposes to consolidate programs differently, expanding the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be integrated into the National Highway System Program. The National Highway System Program would absorb the Interstate Maintenance Program and receive additional funding for bridge maintenance and repair. The Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained, while the Transportation Enhancements set-aside is eliminated. H.R. 7 proposes $150.7 billion in obligations for core highway programs from FY2013 to FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Under H.R. 7, the National Highway System Program would absorb the Interstate Maintenance Program and receive additional funding for bridge maintenance and repair. Only facilities on the NHS would be eligible for funding, with projects required to support national performance goals. The bill would authorize $42.4 billion for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014, broadening its purpose to include bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancements would be eliminated, but up to 15% could be used in areas with populations. H.R. 7 would reduce the percentage of funds required to be spent on urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 from 62.5% to 50%. States must consult with local planning organizations before obligating funds for projects in population areas of 5,000 to 200,000. The bill would provide $10.4 billion for highway safety improvement programs and $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) over FY2013-FY2014. Federal cost share for safety improvement programs would remain at 90%. H.R. 7 proposes amendments to the CMAQ Program, ensuring each state receives a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway taxes. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters. The ER funds eligibility criteria and funding limits are being revised under H.R. 7. The $100 million ceiling for a single disaster in a state is being removed, and U.S. territories are capped at $20 million per year. Section 1506 allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for repair costs. The definition of \"comparable facility\" is clarified, and debris removal reimbursement is limited. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, with funding allocated for tribal roads and federal lands highways. The Tribal Transportation Program would receive $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would receive $550 million annually. Funding distribution among tribes would be based on road mileage and tribal population, and states would receive funding based on the amount of federal land they have. H.R. 7 authorizes funding for the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually and the Federal Lands Transportation program at $535 million annually. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, with funding at $180 million annually. Puerto Rico receives a 75% set-aside of $135 million annually for specific program eligibilities. H.R. 7 also authorizes the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, with funding at $180 million annually. Puerto Rico receives a 75% set-aside of $135 million annually for specific program eligibilities. H.R. 7 authorizes the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually. The Territorial Highway Program is retained and authorized at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. Section 1530 raises the federal share payable for the cost of constructing highways and access roads on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. The discretionary program for high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects aims to improve national competitiveness, reduce congestion, enhance energy security, and promote transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office is required to report on project selection within three years of enactment. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would create a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities with funding distributed based on passenger numbers. The proposed legislation under H.R. 7 and MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013 for ferry systems. Funds would be distributed based on passenger numbers, vehicles carried per day, and route miles serviced. Ferry boats and facilities would be eligible for formula funds under the National Highway Performance Program. The House bill would modify the existing Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program, funding it at $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016. Distribution of funds would be based on the total annual number of vehicles carried by ferry systems in each state. The proposed legislation under H.R. 7 and MAP-21 authorizes funding for ferry systems based on passenger numbers, vehicles carried per day, and route miles serviced. Ferry boats and facilities would be eligible for formula funds under the National Highway System Program. TIFIA provides federal credit assistance for transportation projects, with MAP-21 proposing significant changes to enlarge the program by authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, increasing funding to $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund. This would allow for administrative and subsidy costs to be covered, potentially enabling the Department of Transportation to provide loans totaling $9.9 billion per year. The share of project costs that TIFIA may provide could increase from 33% to 49%, and credit assistance could be provided for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" This change would accelerate the financing of transit projects like the 30/10 Initiative in Los Angeles. MAP-21 proposes changes to the TIFIA program, increasing funding to $1 billion annually. Rural infrastructure projects have a threshold of $25 million and receive loans at half the Treasury rate. 10% of TIFIA funds are reserved for rural projects. Evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance would be abolished, and projects would be assessed on a first-come, first-served basis. Funding exhausted for the year could lead to a master credit agreement or self-payment of credit subsidy for immediate loans. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund. It eliminates evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance and provides assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. The bill also establishes master credit agreements for credit assistance and raises the maximum federal assistance to 49%. Additionally, H.R. 7 proposes to authorize $750 million for TIFIA. H.R. 7 proposes to authorize $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks in addition to enlarging TIFIA. SAFETEA lacks a separate federal freight transportation program, with most funding provided through regular highway programs. The debate on whether the federal government should focus more on funding freight improvements has been ongoing. The Senate bill (MAP-21) addresses some of these issues. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) address policy questions related to freight transport. MAP-21 proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight, while H.R. 7 includes provisions affecting freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan and seek to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. MAP-21 also introduces a core program to direct funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement. The proposed legislation aims to establish a Priority Freight Network (PFN) with 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways, similar in size to the Interstate Highway System. States would prioritize spending their freight program funds on the PFN before other infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation could add 3,000 more miles to the PFN based on future freight importance. States could designate critical rural freight corridors for funding, with a maximum of 20% of funds allocated. These corridors, along with portions of the Interstate System and the PFN, would form the National Freight Network (NFM). States could also use funds for non-Interstate highways or transit projects if they benefit freight movement. The legislation proposes establishing a Priority Freight Network (PFN) with 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways, similar in size to the Interstate Highway System. States would prioritize spending their freight program funds on the PFN before other infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation could add 3,000 more miles to the PFN based on future freight importance. States could designate critical rural freight corridors for funding, with a maximum of 20% of funds allocated. These corridors, along with portions of the Interstate System and the PFN, would form the National Freight Network (NFM). States could also use funds for non-Interstate highways or transit projects if they benefit freight movement. The PFN consists of about 30,000 miles of highway, concentrating funds on segments critical to freight movement. Trucks face congestion and stop-and-go conditions on certain highway segments during rush hours. The Senate and House bills propose funding programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ for highway projects. The House bill focuses on funding freight transport by reducing funding for non-shipping programs and increasing reliance on tolling. It also terminates the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund, potentially benefiting truck transportation. The bills do not alter truck size and weight limits but require a study on possible changes. Trucks experience congestion on urban interchanges during rush hours. H.R. 7 proposes tolling for highway construction, opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The bill includes provisions for increasing truck weight limits and trailer lengths, as well as a pilot program for increased truck weights on certain Interstate Highway segments. Idle reduction equipment weight exemption also increased. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, including the use of performance management throughout the planning process. States and metropolitan planning organizations would need to include performance measures and targets, with consequences for failing to meet targets being relatively mild. Additionally, a national freight strategic plan would be required to be developed by the Department of Transportation as part of the new National Freight Program. The DOT would need to establish quantifiable performance measures for freight movement on the primary freight network under the new freight program. States must set performance targets for freight movement and submit improvement plans if targets are not met. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan, sometimes overlapping with MAP-21 provisions. Section 1115 calls for a national strategic freight plan within three years, while Section 33003 calls for a national surface transportation and freight performance plan within two years. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets. The Secretary would set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with states potentially having to redirect federal funds to address deficiencies. MAP-21 emphasizes state planning and accountability for achieving targets. MAP-21 would require states to update their transportation facilities and planning requirements. Statewide plans must now incorporate metropolitan transportation plans without change and involve nonmetropolitan areas. A performance-based approach with coordinated performance measures and targets is mandated. Metropolitan transportation planning would create two tiers of MPOs based on population size. MAP-21 proposes to create two tiers of MPOs based on population size, Tier I for areas with populations of 1 million or more and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Each tier would have different minimum technical requirements related to modeling, data, staffing, and planning elements. The Secretary would establish these requirements within one year of enactment. Tier I MPOs would be required to implement performance-based planning and targets, while Tier II requirements would be more discretionary. Both tiers would be allowed to select projects from their TIPs in consultation with states and facility owners. Additionally, MAP-21 would only require MPO designation in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more. MAP-21 proposes to require MPO designation in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more, with the option for smaller areas to be designated by agreement. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population may be terminated unless reaffirmed. The legislation aims to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region, but allows for multiple MPOs if deemed appropriate. H.R. 7 also includes provisions for national transportation planning and performance measurement. The transportation plan by DOT under H.R. 7 requires states to submit projects of national and regional significance for inclusion in the plan. It includes a national performance management system to track progress towards performance goals for highways and public transportation. States must report annually on their progress, identify projects of significance in long-range plans, and address congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. Planning must also consider the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion. H.R. 7 introduces new requirements for transportation planning, including considering the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion and energy consumption. It also proposes changes to the designation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) based on urbanized population thresholds. Additionally, the bill addresses budgetary pressures and the efficiency of transportation project delivery. The House and Senate proposals aim to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. This process involves preparing documentation to identify and address project-related impacts on the environment, ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Various environmental requirements may apply depending on the project-specific impacts. The environmental review process for highway and transit projects involves obtaining necessary permits, mitigating project effects on historic sites, and identifying project alternatives to avoid adverse impacts. Compliance with NEPA is required, and approval from FHWA or FTA is needed before final design activities can proceed. All environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations must be coordinated as a single process. Recent legislative efforts under SAFETEA and TEA-21 aimed to expedite environmental reviews for major highway and transit projects by focusing on NEPA compliance. The House proposal in H.R. 7 and MAP-21 goes beyond NEPA, proposing more sweeping changes to expedite project delivery. These changes may either accelerate environmental reviews or result in procedural changes that could slow down project delivery. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 focus on the environmental review phase of transportation project development. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including NEPA, is necessary before project activities can proceed. Projects may require an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment to determine their impact on the environment. The environmental review process for transportation projects under MAP-21 focuses on compliance with NEPA and other environmental requirements. Projects may be categorized as categorical exclusions (CEs) if they have no significant environmental impacts. Approximately 90% of highway projects approved annually are processed as CEs, while 6% require an EA. Changes in MAP-21 aim to expedite decision-making and review processes for federal projects. The provisions under Section 1313 of MAP-21 would amend environmental review procedures to establish new requirements for \"issue resolution\" to ensure timely project completion and resolve disputes. Financial transfer provisions would penalize agencies failing to issue permits or approvals required by law, requiring weekly transfers of $10,000 or $20,000 under certain conditions. Transfer is mandated 180 days after application completion or final project decision, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. Agencies responsible for DOT project approvals vary based on project impacts. The process of issuing approvals or permits for DOT projects involves various agencies such as EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in approvals may be caused by agency under-staffing or lack of funds. Redirecting funds to expedite one project may slow down other applications. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments initiated before and after 2005. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required by MAP-21 to compare completion times of environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental impact statements (EISs) initiated before and after January 1, 2005. DOT must report this information to Congress within a year of MAP-21's enactment. Tracking the time it takes to complete NEPA documents may be challenging, especially for EAs and categorical exclusions (CEs). State DOTs generally do not track this information, but to meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to start tracking and reporting it. The Department of Transportation (DOT) may require states to track and report completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements. This requirement would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process under MAP-21 provisions. Specifically, DOT would be directed to survey state agencies for new categorical exclusions (CEs) suggestions and update CE regulations by moving certain projects to a list that does not require additional approval. Additionally, DOT would specify agency roles for NEPA compliance in multimodal projects and establish criteria for designating projects within existing highway right-of-ways. Projects located within existing highway right-of-ways may be designated as categorical exclusions. Provisions under SAFETEA include assistance to affected state and federal agencies, state assumption of responsibilities for categorical exclusions, and the surface transportation project delivery program. Under a new transportation project delivery pilot program, states can take on federal responsibilities for environmental reviews required under NEPA. The program allows any state to participate, with DOT making determinations on a state's ability to implement it. Provisions in MAP-21's Subtitle C highlight activities important to Congress and clarify NEPA compliance requirements. The House bill includes environmental review provisions under Title III and Subtitle C, which would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. Proposed changes would exclude NEPA requirements for highway and transit projects. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes significant changes to NEPA compliance for highway and transit projects, including raising the cost threshold to $10 million and reducing federal funding requirements. It also includes provisions for specific timeframes for permits, a 270-day deadline for environmental reviews, and limits on judicial review. Additionally, the bill amends requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. The Senate has agreed to an amendment that substitutes the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348, calling for a conference with the House. The inclusion of the H.R. 7 streamlining provisions in H.R. 4348 assures that the House provisions will not be challenged. MAP-21 would make three main changes to speed project delivery, including adding authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. The Senate has agreed to an amendment that substitutes the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348, calling for a conference with the House. MAP-21 would make three main changes to speed project delivery, including adding authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts and increasing federal funding share for innovative highway projects. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" in H.R. 7 allows advance payments for moving costs related to highway projects, without limiting state participation. This program aims to expedite the removal of people from project areas. Additionally, MAP-21 proposes changes to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) to address transportation-related pollutants and air quality standards. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to set air quality standards, including NAAQS for pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Areas meeting or exceeding NAAQS are in \"attainment,\" while those not meeting standards are in \"nonattainment.\" The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. Proposed amendments would change how funding levels are determined and distributed within individual areas. The CMAQ program funds projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas based on specific annual funding levels apportioned to each state. MAP-21's CMAQ apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 ties funds to previous amounts plus 10% of STP funds, with distribution within states based on set limitations and suballocations. States must reserve a portion of funds for transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and specific planning activities. The CMAQ program funds projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas by apportioning specific annual funding levels to each state. Half of the funds are suballocated for projects within designated areas, distributed based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. Suballocated funds must be used for transportation choices, low-emissions equipment, and vehicles. The remaining funds can be used for eligible projects in any nonattainment or maintenance areas within the state. The CMAQ program provides funding for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. States can use apportioned funds for eligible projects, with additional provisions in MAP-21 potentially changing program implementation. These provisions include prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants in nonattainment areas, developing cost-effectiveness tables for projects, allowing optional technical assessments for emissions reductions, and requiring performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. The CMAQ program requires MPOs to prepare performance plans for funded projects and includes provisions amending project eligibility requirements. Incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles include tax credits and non-tax incentives like allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 propose extending the authority for vehicles to use HOV lanes, with limitations if lanes become degraded. They also aim to support electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds for charging stations. MAP-21 would amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include alternative fuel buses. MAP-21 proposes funding for clean fuel buses, including zero emission buses, with at least 65% of funds allocated for clean fuel buses and 10% for clean fuel bus facilities. The bill authorizes $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7 does not have comparable provisions and proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account. The legislation in MAP-21 proposes significant restructuring of the federal transit program, including replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a State of Good Repair Grant Program. This new program focuses on maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems. Funding would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and be distributed based on a new formula using vehicle miles. The FPTA proposes restructuring federal transit programs, including a new State of Good Repair Grant Program funded by the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. This program would distribute funds based on vehicle miles and route miles. Other programs like the Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program and High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would also receive funding from specific accounts for maintenance and upkeep. The Senate bill proposes significant changes to federal transit programs, including combining certain programs and creating new ones. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be part of the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. A new program called Access to Jobs would require recipients to spend 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments on projects for low-income individuals. Two new programs, the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, would also be established. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes a new relief program for natural or man-made disasters, doubling funding for transit on Indian reservations to $30 million annually. It eliminates some programs but largely maintains the federal transit program structure. Funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program would be distributed by formula, moving away from discretionary earmarks. The program in question is a discretionary program that provides funding to bus transit providers in urbanized areas without heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail services. H.R. 7 proposes changes to incentivize contracting out bus services and allows private intercity and charter operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make significant changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process for evaluating and funding interrelated projects. The bill proposes simplifying the New Starts process by reducing stages from four to three: project development, engineering, and construction. Applicants must apply to the Secretary of Transportation to enter project development, eliminating the separate alternatives analysis. During project development, sponsors must provide project justification and local financial commitment information. The Engineering Phase can begin after the NEPA process concludes with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion, and the project is selected as the locally preferred alternative. The Senate bill aims to expedite project delivery for transportation projects by providing federal funding assistance and special warrants for projects under $100 million. It would eliminate the Small Starts program but create a pilot program for expedited project delivery. The House bill, on the other hand, would maintain the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts programs. The House bill, like the Senate bill, maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects. It allocates $150 million for Small Starts projects and includes provisions for expediting projects, changing project justification criteria, and adding private contributions as evaluation factors. The bill also maintains the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas but adds exceptions for small bus transit systems. The House bill allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use federal funds for operating expenses, with varying percentages based on the number of buses in peak service. The House bill allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas to use federal funds for operating expenses based on the number of buses in peak service. H.R. 7 proposes a cost share of 25% federal, 75% local for systems operating between 76 and 100 buses, and 50% federal for systems with 75 or fewer buses. It also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% and calls for the development of a national rail plan for passenger and freight rail investments. The bill proposes amendments to the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service. It also mandates the development of guidance for measuring train delays, conducting a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and surveying track access arrangements. Additionally, it promotes the development of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill proposes the creation of an equipment pool for standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services, controlled by Amtrak and states. It aims to achieve economies of scale in car production and maintenance but may discourage innovation in car design. Implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design regulations. The bill H.R. 7 proposes changes to Amtrak operations, including repealing the congestion grant program and reducing funding for operating assistance grants. It also addresses food and beverage service regulations on Amtrak trains. H.R. 7 proposes changes to Amtrak operations, including repealing the self-supporting requirement for food and beverage service, putting it out to competitive bidding, and allowing subsidies only if a net loss is foreseen. It also includes amendments to federal grant programs for relocating railroad lines and expanding eligible uses of the RRIF Program. The Senate bill proposes changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the ceiling on freight charges for rate relief cases, imposing shorter procedural deadlines, studying railroad asset replacement costs, requiring the STB to report railroad service complaints, and repealing a capital grant program for smaller freight railroads. H.R. 7 would repeal a capital grant program for smaller freight railroads and includes provisions to facilitate access to the RRIF loan program. Positive train control (PTC) was mandated by Congress in 2008 to prevent accidents, but implementation has faced challenges due to high costs and spectrum limitations. The Senate bill allows the Department of Transportation to extend the deadline for PTC implementation if deemed infeasible by a railroad. The Senate bill allows the Department of Transportation to extend the deadline for Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation, with the deadline set at December 31, 2018. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes extending the deadline for PTC implementation to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and eliminates the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. It also allows railroads to implement equivalent safety measures and adjust installation routes. Additionally, the Senate bill includes provisions for highway safety programs, such as creating an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and increasing civil penalties for vehicle safety violations. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes consolidating various highway safety grant programs into one general program with reduced funding. It would also prohibit federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. Both the House and Senate bills aim to prevent drivers who have failed drug and alcohol tests from avoiding penalties by switching employers. Additionally, they strengthen measures against \"reincarnated carriers\" and provide similar levels of funding for truck safety. The House and Senate bills aim to improve transit safety by authorizing DOT to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems. This includes creating a safety certification program and ensuring state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. H.R. 7 aims to improve transit safety by authorizing grants to states for oversight agencies, without giving DOT authority to set safety standards. It would also require federal grant funds to be spent on safety and repair projects first, and provide financial assistance to state oversight organizations. Additionally, it would authorize funding for transportation research and education, technology deployment programs, and prize competitions for transportation innovations. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 propose conducting studies to improve various aspects of transportation, including safety, cost analysis, congestion reduction, infrastructure investment needs, and financing options. They also address the utilization of revenues in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for waterside infrastructure maintenance. H.R. 4348 includes a provision to ensure that budgetary resources match fund receipts for harbor maintenance programs."
