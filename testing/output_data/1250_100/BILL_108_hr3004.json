    "content": "The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003, also known as the Electric Reliability Standards, amends the Federal Power Act to include a new section on electric reliability. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, Electric Reliability Organization, and reliability standards for ensuring the reliable operation of the transmission network. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, including facilities, reliable operation, interconnection, and transmission organization. It focuses on ensuring the reliable operation of the transmission network by maintaining system stability and preventing cascading failures. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines terms like 'transmission organization' and 'regional entity' for the operation and enforcement of reliability standards within the bulk-power system. The Commission has jurisdiction over the ERO, regional entities, and all users, owners, and operators of the bulk-power system to approve and enforce compliance with reliability standards. A final rule must be issued within 180 days to implement the requirements of this section. Following the Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003, the Commission may certify an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) that can develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system. The ERO must demonstrate independence from users and operators, fair stakeholder representation, and equitable allocation of charges among end users. The Electric Reliability Organization must enforce reliability standards fairly and impartially, impose penalties for non-compliance, allow public comment and due process, and seek recognition in Canada and Mexico. The organization must file proposed standards with the Commission for approval if deemed just and reasonable. The Commission determines the fairness and public interest of proposed reliability standards, giving weight to technical expertise. The Electric Reliability Organization must consider proposals from regional entities as just and reasonable. The Commission can remand proposed standards for further review. The Commission can order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit new or modified reliability standards if necessary. The final rule must include fair processes for resolving conflicts with existing provisions accepted by the Commission. Transmission organizations must comply with existing provisions until the Commission finds a conflict and orders a change. The Commission can order changes to reliability standards if conflicts arise, and the Electric Reliability Organization must develop modified standards. The ERO can impose penalties on users or operators for violations of approved standards, with penalties taking effect after 31 days of filing with the Commission. The Commission can review penalties imposed on users or operators for violations of approved standards within 30 days of filing. The Commission may affirm, set aside, reinstate, or modify the penalty after a hearing, and expedited procedures will be implemented for such hearings. The Commission can order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on bulk-power system users or operators for violations. Regulations allow the ERO to delegate authority to a regional entity with specific governance requirements for proposing and enforcing reliability standards. The Commission has the authority to delegate to a regional entity for effective administration of bulk-power system reliability. They can take necessary actions against the ERO or regional entity for compliance with reliability standards. Penalties imposed must be reasonable and consider efforts to remedy violations promptly. The ERO can assign enforcement authority to a regional entity, and the Commission can ensure compliance with reliability standards. The Electric Reliability Organization must seek approval from the Commission for any proposed rule changes. The President is encouraged to negotiate international agreements with Canada and Mexico for compliance with reliability standards. The ERO conducts periodic assessments of the bulk-power system's reliability. The Electric Reliability Organization has authority over reliability standards for the bulk-power system only. States can still take action to ensure safety and reliability of electric service as long as it doesn't conflict with reliability standards. The Commission can determine if a State action is inconsistent with a reliability standard after consultation with the ERO and the State. The Commission can establish regional advisory bodies composed of members appointed by Governors to provide advice on governance and standards within a region. These bodies may also assess fees and ensure actions are in the public interest. The Commission can establish regional advisory bodies to provide advice on governance and standards within a region. These bodies may also assess fees and ensure actions are in the public interest. The Commission may defer to the advice of regional advisory bodies organized on an Interconnection-wide basis. The provisions of this section do not apply to Alaska or Hawaii."
