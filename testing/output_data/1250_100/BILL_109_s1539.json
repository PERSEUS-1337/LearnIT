    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2005\" emphasizes the importance of providing permanent homes for children in foster care, especially those with special needs. Despite previous legislation promoting adoptions, many children are still waiting to be adopted and require financial assistance for healing from past abuse and neglect. SEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for placement in a public or private agency, foster care, or child care institution. The State determines if a child should be removed from home for safety reasons and if they have special needs for adoption assistance payments. Non-US citizen children meeting these criteria are eligible. Children previously eligible for adoption assistance may qualify again. The paragraph discusses exceptions to adoption assistance payments for non-US citizen children adopted outside the United States or brought in for adoption. The text discusses exceptions to adoption assistance payments for children placed in foster care after a failed adoption and the requirement for states to use savings for services under the Adoption Equality Act of 2005. The text outlines criteria for providing adoption assistance to a child with special needs, including the state's determination that the child cannot be returned home and the presence of specific factors making adoption without assistance difficult. The amendments made by this section regarding adoption assistance for children with special needs will take effect on October 1, 2005."
