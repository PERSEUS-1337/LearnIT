    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"New Bridging Industry and Government Through Hi-Tech Research on Energy Efficiency Act of 2008\". Congress enacted legislation to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, requiring a fleet-wide fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The new standards represent a 27 percent increase and will cost Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors $85 billion in research and development investments. This will add an estimated $7 billion per year to their current investments of $16 billion annually. Investments in new energy efficiency initiatives should not detract from current investments in vehicle safety technology. Energy availability is a national security issue, with a significant portion of US energy coming from imported petroleum products. Clean diesel technology can reduce emissions in the short-term while alternative energy sources are developed. Harmonization of biodiesel standards will enable wider use of clean diesel technology. Electric vehicle propulsion can reduce dependence on petroleum-based energy, but energy storage challenges remain for commercial viability. The United States Government invests in research and development of advanced fuel and efficiency technology, spending millions of dollars annually. Coordinating these efforts could lead to greater gains in alternative fuel technologies. The Federal Government should coordinate efforts to relieve the auto industry's cost burden by promoting research and development of advanced technology. The Federal Government should coordinate efforts to promote research and development of advanced battery technology. The Secretary of Energy will establish a grant program for research and development of high-efficiency advanced battery technologies at National Laboratories and institutions of higher education. Priority will be given to partnerships with vehicle manufacturers for technology demonstration and validation. The Secretary of Energy authorizes $150,000,000 annually from 2009 to 2013 for advanced battery technology research and development. The Research and Development Tax Credit is outlined in Section 4. The Research and Development Tax Credit under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a refundable portion for expenditures on technology meeting Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. This amendment applies at the partnership level for partnerships electing to have it apply. The Research and Development Tax Credit under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a refundable portion for expenditures on technology meeting Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. This applies at the partnership level, where overpayments of tax are treated as made by the partnership, and credits to partners are reduced accordingly. Section 45C(b)(1) is amended by removing subparagraph (D). These amendments apply to expenses incurred after December 31, 2007. SEC. 5. INTERAGENCY GROUP ON CAFE STANDARDS. Establishment of Interagency Working Group on Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards with representatives from various federal departments and agencies, automobile manufacturing industry, and additional appointees by the President. Chaired by the representative of the Department of Defense or Energy. The Interagency Working Group aims to coordinate federal agencies' efforts in researching and developing advanced fuel technology to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. It meets regularly to assess auto companies' progress in meeting fuel economy standards, proposes policy recommendations, and formulates a budget for federal spending on advanced fuel research and development. The Interagency Working Group coordinates federal agencies' research and development of advanced fuel technologies. It reviews agency priorities, promotes communication among government, private sector, and academia, and submits an annual report to Congress. SEC. 6. The EPA will collaborate with standard-setting organizations to harmonize biofuels production standards. An annual progress report will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 7. Addresses the installation of hydrogen fueling pumps. SEC. 7. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a grant program to install 100 hydrogen fueling pumps at gas stations by 2013. Gas station owners must contribute 10% of the pump cost. $50,000,000 is authorized annually for this program. SEC. 8. $50,000,000 is authorized for the acquisition of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for Federal agencies from 2012 to 2014."
