    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section's title and its findings. The \"Medicaid DSH Integrity Act\" recognizes the importance of Medicaid DSH payments for safety net hospitals serving low-income individuals. Regulations have been implemented to ensure proper use of DSH funds and auditing requirements. The regulations aim to maintain the integrity of Medicaid DSH payments, but recent policy changes could lead to significant reductions in payments to safety net providers. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce policy changes related to the calculation of limits under the Social Security Act. An interim final rule will be published to revise the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as necessary. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes allowing hospitals to include all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients, even if the patient has insurance for other services. States can use their own definition of allowable costs in Medicaid plans as long as they do not exceed allowable amounts. CMS will interpret the audit requirement for inpatient and outpatient hospital services under the Social Security Act to align with the term \"hospital services\" and not impose a more restrictive interpretation. They will revise the General DSH Audit and Reporting Protocol to allow for different cost-to-charge ratios and alternative methodologies for determining actual costs. The Social Security Act is amended to change the year from 2004 to 2008. Definitions are provided for terms like CMS, Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations, Medicaid DSH program, and Secretary."
