The Secretary will establish a Frontline Providers Loan Repayment Program where individuals agree to serve as health professionals for at least 2 years in a healthcare facility in a scarcity area in exchange for student loan repayments. To be eligible, individuals must submit an application and sign a contract. Participants are approved upon the Secretary's approval. The Loan Repayment Program requires approval of the individual's application and contract by the Secretary. Preference is given to applicants with interdisciplinary training. The Secretary determines scarcity areas for placement and gives preference to those with interdisciplinary healthcare programs. Written notice is provided upon approval. The contract for the Loan Repayment Program includes an agreement for student loan repayment and frontline care services for a minimum of 2 years in a healthcare facility in a scarcity area. The contract for the Loan Repayment Program includes provisions for financial obligations, damages for breach of contract, and other statements determined by the Secretary. Student loan repayment amounts are determined by the Secretary to recruit healthcare providers into the program. The Secretary may contract with an individual's loan provider for the payment of student loan repayments. If an individual breaches the contract by not fulfilling their service obligation, the United States can recover the total amount paid under the contract plus interest. The term 'frontline care scarcity area' refers to designated areas with a shortage of healthcare professionals. The term 'frontline care services' refers to health care services in various fields provided by qualified professionals who have completed accredited programs. The loan repayment program for health professions education in the United States is authorized to receive increasing appropriations from 2010 to 2015, with adjustments for subsequent years based on cost increases. The Secretary is required to start implementing the program within 180 days of enactment."
