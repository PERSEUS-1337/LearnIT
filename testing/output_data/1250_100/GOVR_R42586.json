    "content": "The FY2013 discretionary appropriations were influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which set spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked with developing a deficit reduction plan, but the failure to enact legislation by January 15, 2012, triggered automatic spending cuts through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013. Certain programs were exempt from sequestration, and special rules governed the process. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) contains provisions regarding sequestration, with Sections 255 and 256 addressing budget authority reductions. While Section 255 exempts VA programs from sequestration, Section 256(e) allows for a maximum 2% reduction in VA medical care budget authority. OMB confirmed VA programs, including Veterans' Medicare Care, are exempt from sequestration. Failure to enact deficit reduction legislation in 2012 led to redefining \"security\" and \"non-security\" discretionary spending categories. President Barack Obama submitted a request for military construction appropriations for FY2013. The House Committee on Appropriations introduced H.R. 5854 for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2013. The House passed the bill with a vote of 407-12. H.R. 5854 was then received in the Senate and placed on the Legislative Calendar for further consideration. The Office of Management and Budget issued a Statement of Administration Policy recommending a veto of H.R. 5854 due to concerns about military construction funding and Project Labor Agreements. The Senate introduced its own draft of the bill but no further action was taken. Representative Harold Rogers introduced a continuing appropriations resolution (H.J.Res. 117) which was passed by the House. The House passed resolution H.J.Res. 117 by a vote of 329-91, which was later approved by the Senate and signed into law as P.L. 112-175. The resolution allowed for department operations to continue at the same monthly rate as previous appropriations, with a slight increase permitted. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933, P.L. 113-6) funded the government through the remainder of FY2013, including the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013. Amounts appropriated to various accounts in P.L. 113-6 are displayed in tables. In response to Hurricane Sandy, the President requested $47.4 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations, including $259.9 million for military construction and veterans affairs. The Senate proposed a bill for $60.4 billion, with $259.8 million allocated to military construction and veterans affairs. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2), was enacted on January 28, with funding details provided in Table 3. The Senate agreed on January 28 without amendment by Yea-Nay vote: 62-36 (Record Vote No. 4). The President enacted the bill on January 29, 2013, as P.L. 113-2. Authorization of funding to the Department of Defense for military construction is done through the National Defense Authorization Act. The House version of the NDAA for FY2013 (H.R. 4310) was introduced in the House on March 29, 2012, and passed by recorded vote on May 18. The House version of the NDAA for FY2013 (H.R. 4310) was passed by a vote of 299-120 on May 18. The bill was received in the Senate on June 19 and referred to the Committee on Armed Services. OMB issued a statement on May 15, 2012, citing objections to the legislation, including concerns about the bill's impact on defense strategy, funding for missile defense, and base closure rounds. The Senate version of the NDAA for FY2013 (S. 3254) was introduced on June 4, 2012, with serious concerns raised by the Office of Management and Budget regarding provisions that depart from the President's budget request and limit key authorities of the Executive. The Administration objected to Title XVII, which would restrict funding for the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, as well as section 2208 which limits funds for the realignment of the U.S. Marine Corps. The Senate received H.R. 4310 on June 19 and referred the bill to the Committee on Armed Services. The committee discharged the bill on December 4, 2012, and the Senate passed H.R. 4310 after several amendments and a conference committee report. The Senate passed H.R. 4310 after amendments and a conference report. The President signed the bill on January 2, 2013, enacting it as P.L. 112-239. The military construction appropriations account includes funds for new construction, improvements, and facility planning for active and reserve military forces. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program (NSIP) is a common fund for NATO members to cover construction costs. Family housing accounts fund construction, maintenance, utilities, and other expenses for military personnel and their families. The DOD Housing Improvement Fund provides seed money for public-private partnerships for military housing privatization. The Homeowners Assistance Fund aids federal personnel unable to sell their homes near closing installations. The ARRA expanded eligibility for wounded DOD personnel. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account funds disposal facilities for chemical weapons. The BRAC Account 1990 funds environmental remediation from previous base closure rounds. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 2005 funds military construction, relocation, and environmental requirements for the 2005 BRAC round and DOD Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy. The Department of Defense has completed implementing the 2005 BRAC Commission's recommendations, involving complex construction and movement to prepare new facilities, wind down operations, and transfer personnel and equipment. The Department of Defense estimated one-time implementation costs for BRAC 2005 at $34.5 billion. The House version of the NDAA includes a provision to establish a single \"Department of Defense Base Closure Account\" consolidating all existing BRAC Treasury accounts. This account would fund environmental restoration, property management, military construction projects, and other costs related to closed or realigned military installations. The President requested congressional authorization for two new BRAC rounds in 2013 and 2015 to reduce infrastructure supporting military troop reductions. The proposed legislation, \"the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2012,\" would follow a process similar to previous BRAC rounds. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 required the Secretary of Defense to analyze future military infrastructure needs, make recommendations for adjustments, and submit them to an independent commission for review. The commission had the power to revise or reject recommendations before submitting them to the President for approval. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 gave the commission three options for disposing of recommendations: reject, return for revision, or approve. Once the President approved the list, Congress had 45 days to pass a resolution to halt the process. If not enacted, the Secretary had to implement recommendations within six years. Sunset provisions were included in the law, terminating the 1990 and 2001 BRAC Commissions. These acts allowed for the closure or adjustment of domestic military installations. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 authorized the closure or realignment of military installations in the US. The act specified exclusive authority for selecting closures or realignments between 1990 and 2006. The President's recommendation for new BRAC rounds combined elements from previous rounds but did not appear in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013. The House version of the NDAA included a provision prohibiting additional BRAC rounds. The Senate Committee on Armed Services discussed the possibility of another BRAC round, despite resistance from senior Army and Air Force officials. The committee directed a review of DOD's processes for identifying excess bases. Congress shares authority over the military establishment with the executive branch. The Constitution grants Congress the power to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, and make rules for the government and regulation of military forces. It also appoints the President as the Commander in Chief of the military. This creates a natural tension between Congress and the President in terms of military deployment and management. During the 1960s and 1970s, tension between Congress and the President regarding DOD real property management escalated. President Lyndon B. Johnson's veto of a military construction bill in 1965 delayed addressing military base closures for a decade. President Gerald R. Ford vetoed a bill in 1976 that would have imposed a one-year delay on military installation closures. Congress passed a revised bill with a reduced advance notification period, enacted as P.L. 94-431. The provisions of P.L. 94-431, which reduced the advance notification period for military base closures to 60 days, expired at the end of FY1977. The Senate Committee on Armed Services made these restrictions permanent in S. 1474, which was enacted as Section 612(a) of P.L. 95-82 on August 1, 1977. This statutory restriction, codified as Section 2687 of Title 10 of the United States Code, prohibits the closure or realignment of military installations without notifying the Committees on Armed Services and providing an evaluation of the fiscal and local impacts. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 imposed restrictions on military base closures or realignments, requiring notification to Congress and evaluation of various impacts. It also created a new restriction on changing operational activity at military installations. Additionally, the Secretary must notify Congress before reducing more than 1,000 Armed Forces members at a military installation. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 imposed restrictions on military base closures or realignments, requiring notification to Congress and evaluation of impacts. The President or defense secretaries do not need specific authorization from Congress to close or realign domestic military installations. Army and Air Force personnel in Germany are being consolidated into two large military communities. Military construction has been focused in Kaiserslautern and Grafenw\u00f6hr-Vilseck. The Secretary of Defense agreed to reconsider moving two brigade combat teams from Germany. The Department of Defense will reduce the U.S. military presence in Europe by approximately 15% over the next decade. This includes recalling and inactivating units such as the 170th and 172nd Infantry Brigades in Germany, the Air Force's 81st Fighter Squadron, the 603rd Air Control Squadron, and the Army's 5th Corps Headquarters. Approximately 2,500 additional Army personnel will also be withdrawn over the next five years, while two heavy brigade combat teams will remain in Germany. The U.S. military presence in Europe will be reconfigured to include a rotational heavy brigade combat team, ballistic missile defense-capable destroyers in Spain, V-22 aircraft for special operations, aviation detachment in Poland, ground-based radar in Turkey, and additional Special Forces units in Germany. The President's FY2013 request includes funding for construction projects in Germany, including upgrades to facilities and replacement of schools and medical centers. The U.S. military is involved in a $1.2 billion replacement project for the medical center at the Rhine Ordnance Barracks in the Kaiserslautern Military Community. Japan is constructing a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps aviation units, with plans delayed due to site selection and domestic political considerations. The completion date for the Futenma Replacement Facility has been pushed beyond 2014. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted changes in U.S. force posture in the Pacific AOR, including the relocation of U.S. marines from Okinawa to Guam, construction of a new military base in Okinawa, and tour normalization in Korea. However, the administration has now limited the marines' relocation, re-negotiated plans with Japan, and proposed a new strategic plan with rotational forces in Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines. The House and Senate Committees on Armed Services are considering changes in U.S. force posture in the Pacific AOR, including the relocation of U.S. marines from Okinawa to Guam. The House Committee recommended temporary authorization for the Secretary of Defense to use operation and maintenance funds to assist Guam in preparing for the Marine redeployment. The Senate Committee noted the President's request for defense operation and maintenance funding, including funds for DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment. The committee expressed concerns about the funding for socioeconomic and infrastructure improvements on Guam related to the Marine relocation, citing a lack of comprehensive cost and schedule data. They directed the Comptroller General to assess costs associated with the revised plan for realigning Marines in the Asia-Pacific region. The assessment will identify and assess costs related to moving marines to Guam, Hawaii, and Australia, distinguishing between known, estimated, and unknown costs. It will also estimate recurring annual costs affecting future Department of Defense budgets, including sustainment of forces and base operating support. U.S. ground forces have been concentrated in forward bases along the demarcation line between South Korea and North Korea since the Armistice in 1954, with headquarters at Yongsan. USFK and U.S. Army and Air Force units are being consolidated into military communities at Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys. The GAO noted incomplete DOD cost estimates totaling $17.6 billion through 2020 for initiatives in South Korea, including extending tour lengths and moving dependents. The lack of a business case analysis raises concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed views on the FY2013 bill. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the cost and plan for Tour Normalization in Korea, directing the Secretary of Defense to report within 60 days. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also raised concerns about the lack of a business case analysis for the $13 billion construction program in South Korea. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have raised concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys in Korea for the relocation of US troops and tour normalization. They are requesting a detailed business case analysis before approving any future funding requests. The Senate Committee on Armed Services included a provision in the NDAA for FY2012 to bar funds for tour normalization until a cost analysis is conducted. The House version of the NDAA for FY2013 continues this prohibition, while the Senate bill does not. Senator Carl Levin discussed defense budget cuts at a public forum. Senator Carl Levin discussed defense budget cuts at a public forum, expressing concerns about excessive spending on family housing for troops in Korea. President Obama's Executive Order 13502 allowed for the use of Project Labor Agreements in construction projects, giving agencies the option to require them on a project-by-project basis. The Executive Order 13502 allows for the use of Project Labor Agreements in construction projects, giving agencies the option to require them on a project-by-project basis. However, Section 517 of the House-passed version of the military construction appropriation (H.R. 5854) prohibits the use of funds to require or prohibit bidders, contractors, or subcontractors from entering into agreements with labor organizations. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, 2013, includes a provision to forbid contracting officers from requiring or prohibiting contractors from entering into Project Labor Agreements. This provision was adopted by a recorded vote and led to an objection from the OMB. Additionally, the NDAA for FY2013 extends the Secretary of Defense's authority to use funds for construction in specific geographic areas. The Secretary of Defense may use up to an additional $300 million in O&M funding for construction in Afghanistan if certified necessary. Congress granted this authority in FY2004 and has renewed it annually. Concerns were raised over incremental funding of construction projects and restructuring of Air Force Reserve Component command and infrastructure. Budget authority is provided for military construction projects, with large-scale projects sometimes funded incrementally or in phases to manage costs. Incremental funding for construction projects has led to controversy between the executive and legislative branches. The executive prefers full budget authority allocated when requested, while appropriators suggest incremental funding to avoid over-committing limited budget authority. Congress has been more receptive to incremental construction, allowing for more efficient allocation of military construction dollars among projects. The Committee recommends incremental funding for various military construction projects for fiscal year 2013, including a High Performance Computing Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, U.S. STRATCOM Replacement Facility in Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, Cadet Barracks in West Point, New York, Hospital Replacement in Fort Bliss, Texas, and Explosives Handling Wharf 2 in Kitsap, Washington. The NDAA proposes the creation of a \"National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force\" to study and report on the force structure needed to support certain goals. The bill also prohibits the expenditure of FY2013 funding to remove any Air Force aircraft from Reserve Component units assigned as of May 31, 2012. The bill authorizes $1.4 billion to freeze Air Force structure in place until the end of FY2013, retaining Reserve Component aircraft at their current locations. The Secretary of the Air Force has announced plans to transfer aircraft from reserve component units, but the bill aims to prevent this by prohibiting the removal of any aircraft assigned as of May 31, 2012. The creation of a \"National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force\" is proposed to study and report on the force structure needed to support certain goals. The bill includes objective criteria for realignments and closures of military installations not covered by existing requirements. It prohibits actions that would result in the closure of installations with at least 300 civilian personnel without proper notification to Congress and justification. The bill includes criteria for realignments and closures of military installations with at least 300 civilian personnel. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs providing benefits to veterans, including disability compensation, medical care, and educational benefits. The VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased significantly from FY2006 to FY2013, with a proposed budget of $135.87 billion for FY2013. Mandatory funding is higher than discretionary funding for the VA, with mandatory funding accounting for 54.4% of total funding in FY2013. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is responsible for maintaining U.S. monuments and memorials commemorating the achievements of the U.S. Armed Forces since World War I. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims was established in 1988 to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has the authority to compel action by the VA and set aside decisions. Arlington National Cemetery is administered by the Secretary of the Army and hosts non-funeral ceremonies. H.R. 5854 provides funding for Arlington National Cemetery in a single account, differing from the Administration's request. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports the operation of retirement homes in Washington, DC and Gulfport, MS. The Armed Forces Retirement Home facilities are funded by the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund, which is maintained through various sources. The FY2012 enacted appropriations, Administration request, and funding for FY2013 are detailed in Table 7."
