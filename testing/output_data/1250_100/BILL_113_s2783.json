    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Value Based Insurance Design for Better Care Act of 2014\" or the \"VBID for Better Care Act of 2014\". Congress finds that financial barriers for high-value medical services can reduce their use, leading to increased total medical expenditures. Research shows that reducing out-of-pocket expenses for these services can improve health outcomes. Therefore, barriers to high-value services should be reduced to increase their utilization. Value-Based Insurance Design adjusts patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications and clinical services based on clinical value, not just cost. It recognizes that different services provide varying clinical benefits and that the benefit depends on the situation, provider, and care location. The current one-size-fits-all copayment system under Medicare does not acknowledge the value differences in health outcomes from different medical interventions. Medicare should establish copayment and coinsurance requirements using Value-Based Insurance Design. Establishing coinsurance requirements through Value-Based Insurance Design can lead to improved patient-centered health outcomes, increased personal responsibility, and more efficient use of taxpayer dollars. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 3-year demonstration program to test value-based insurance design in eligible Medicare Advantage plans. At least two MA regions will be selected for the program, and approved Medicare Advantage plans will participate. The program will start in the first plan year after the selection of eligible plans. The Secretary will establish a 3-year demonstration program to test value-based insurance design in eligible Medicare Advantage plans. At least two MA regions will be selected for the program, and approved plans must have a quality rating of 4 stars or higher. The value-based insurance design methodology identifies specific prescription medications and clinical services reimbursable under Medicare, with requirements for specialized MA plans for special needs individuals and subsidy eligible individuals. The value-based insurance design methodology under the Medicare Advantage plan aims to reduce copayments and coinsurance for specific chronic clinical conditions approved by the Secretary. The Medicare Advantage plan can reduce copayments and coinsurance for specific chronic conditions to encourage individuals to use prescription medications and clinical services. This reduction must be evidence-based and aims to promote the use of healthcare providers identified by the organization for the plan year. The Medicare Advantage plan participating in the demonstration program cannot increase copayments or coinsurance for covered items or services to discourage their use. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the implementation status of the program within one year of its start, including a list of medications and services identified for the first plan year. The curr_chunk discusses the identification of medications, services, and providers for a plan year, detailing copayment or coinsurance amounts and reductions from the previous year. Additionally, it mentions a review and assessment of utilization of value-based insurance design methodologies by the Secretary through a contract with an independent entity. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of value-based insurance design methodologies by Medicare Advantage plans in a demonstration program. It evaluates the impact of reducing copayments on medication adherence, service utilization, quality metrics, health outcomes, and beneficiary experience. Additionally, it analyzes the cost differences for Medicare Advantage plans participating in the program. The curr_chunk focuses on analyzing the cost differences for Medicare Advantage plans participating in a demonstration program compared to those not participating. It also evaluates the impact of reducing copayments on providers and assesses the overall outcomes and experiences for beneficiaries. The contract or agreement requires the entity to submit a report on these findings. The entity must submit a report to the Secretary on the review and assessment conducted, to be included in a report to Congress within 3 years of the demonstration program's start. The report will detail the results, recommendations for improving methodologies, and reducing copayments for Medicare Advantage plans under part C of title XVIII. The Secretary will expand the demonstration program permanently if it benefits Medicare beneficiaries and the program, unless it increases expenditures or decreases the quality of healthcare services. The Secretary has the authority to waive provisions of the Social Security Act if necessary. The Secretary will transfer funds from specific Trust Funds to implement the demonstration program under sections XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act."
