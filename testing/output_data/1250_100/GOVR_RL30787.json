    "content": "House procedures in the House of Representatives are not solely based on the Rules adopted at the beginning of each new Congress. They also include constitutional mandates, parliamentary principles in Jefferson's Manual, laws that act as rules, published precedents, committee rules, and party caucus rules. These parliamentary authorities are cited by members when raising points of order or defending against them. The House Manual contains the chief authorities governing parliamentary procedure, including the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, House Rules, and relevant laws. The House of Representatives follows various parliamentary authorities, including Jefferson's Manual, House Rules, and rule-making statutes. Official reference documents compile and digest House precedents, such as House Practice and Deschler's Precedents. Additionally, parliamentary reference documents include committee rules, floor procedures, and How Our Laws Are Made. The report reviews House procedure principles and parliamentary reference sources like Jefferson's Manual, House Rules, and How Our Laws Are Made. It describes the format and content of these documents, with sample pages and access information provided. The report summarizes House parliamentary procedure principles, including the multiple authorities governing House procedure, the constitutional power of the House to make its own rules, the non-self-enforcing nature of House rules, adherence to precedents, and the development of practices without formal adoption. The House has the authority to determine its rules of procedure, which are not solely governed by the rules of the House but also by other parliamentary authorities. The House exercises its rule-making power at the beginning of each Congress to establish its internal procedures and can adopt special rules as needed. The House utilizes its rule-making power by adopting special rules and enacting rule-making statutes to define procedures for considering measures on the floor. These rules have the same effect as the House's official rules and are created through the House's constitutional authority. The House's rule-making authority allows it to adopt special rules and rule-making statutes to govern its proceedings. These rules can be suspended or waived by unanimous consent, two-thirds vote, or majority vote. Points of order can be raised by Members to enforce these rules. When a point of order is raised, the chair rules on its validity, citing parliamentary rationale. If sustained, the House cannot proceed with the action. The chair enforces House Rules by refusing actions not permitted, reminding members of decorum, and may rule actions out of order. Unless a point of order is raised, the House can proceed contrary to procedural authorities. The House can proceed contrary to procedural authorities, but points of order and rulings of the chair only apply to procedural questions based on House rules and precedents. The chair does not rule on constitutional violations, as the chamber settles constitutional matters through votes on substantive questions. Party caucus rules are not enforceable on the House floor and do not have the same standing as House Rules. The House rules are enforced by one party, while informal practices evolve over time. Committee rules cannot be enforced on the House floor but can be enforced within the committee. Precedents are set when the chair rules on a point of order, with the House rarely entertaining appeals of the chair's rulings. The House has the authority to determine its own rules through majority vote. Precedents in the House are created when the chair rules on a parliamentary inquiry or when the House makes a procedural decision by majority vote. They influence how current House rules are applied by relating past decisions to the specific case at hand. Precedents function like case law, with more weight given to those based on the chair's disposition of points of order or decisions by majority vote. Members and the chair often cite precedents to support their arguments or rulings. The House rarely disregards its precedents, which serve to complement and supplement the House rules. Precedents in the House are crucial as they influence the application of current rules based on past decisions. Majority vote decisions hold more weight than chair's responses to inquiries. Recent precedents are more significant than older ones, especially if part of an established pattern. Precedents should be evaluated in historical context. Members seeking precedents can consult the Parliamentarian. Some House practices are informal and not enforceable through a point of order. These practices, though not mandated, are rarely challenged on the House floor. The House Manual compiles key parliamentary sources with authoritative force in House proceedings, including the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, and House Rules. It also includes informal practices like the Speaker's recognition of Members for speeches and committee members' priority for offering floor amendments. The Manual is a valuable resource for understanding House procedures. The House Manual, also known as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" is an official publication by the Government Printing Office that includes parliamentary authorities for House proceedings. Each Congress edition is designated with a House Document number from the preceding Congress. It contains a comprehensive index and annotations by the Parliamentarian of the House. The House Manual, also known as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" contains parliamentary authorities for House proceedings, with annotations by the Parliamentarian of the House. It is organized in numbered sections for easy reference and citation, with a comprehensive index providing citations by section number. The House Rules were recodified in the 106th Congress, reducing their number from 52 to 28, leading to changes in section numbers within the Manual. The House Manual, also known as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" contains parliamentary authorities for House proceedings, with annotations by the Parliamentarian of the House. Citations under subject headings are identified by descriptive specifications. The index should be thoroughly examined to find all pertinent citations. Annotations provide historical context, current practice, and important precedents. Citations to precedents are presented in parentheses throughout the annotations. The report provides various citation formats for referencing precedents, including Congressional Record, Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents, Deschler's Precedents, Procedure in the House, Pronouncements by the Speaker, United States Code, and United States Reports. The parliamentarian's annotations in the House Manual provide practical value by showing the relationship between specific clauses and precedents, updating important precedents not found in earlier compilations, and offering time-saving research tools for readers. The annotations are included in sample House Manual pages and cover substantive changes in House Rules since the previous edition. The House Manual includes the text of the Constitution with annotations by the parliamentarian explaining how the House has interpreted and applied constitutional provisions, particularly Article I, section 5. It outlines procedural requirements such as the House's authority to adopt rules, keeping an official journal, quorum requirements, and conducting yea and nay votes. The parliamentarian's annotations provide practical insights on the application of these provisions in the House. House Rule XXVIII states that Jefferson's Manual governs the House in applicable cases. Thomas Jefferson wrote A Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, based on British House of Commons practices. The U.S. Senate does not consider it an authority on its own procedure. Jefferson's Manual is distinct from the House Manual and the adopted Rules of the House, with annotations by the parliamentarian explaining its relevance to current House procedure. The House's parliamentary procedures are based on Jefferson's Manual, with annotations by the parliamentarian. The Rules of the House are adopted at the start of each Congress, with amendments recommended by the majority party. The House Manual presents the Rules clause by clause, with annotations identifying changes since the last Congress. Non-germane amendments are prohibited by the House. The House Manual for each Congress includes detailed annotations on the Rules of the House, with any changes adopted by the House on opening day. The recodification of the Rules in the 106th Congress reduced the number of rules from 52 to 28. The recodification of the Rules in the 106th Congress reduced the number of rules from 52 to 28, with detailed explanations provided in the House Manual. The House has the authority to establish procedural regulations through simple resolutions or statutory measures. Statutory rule-making provisions in Congress are created through an exercise of each chamber's constitutional rule-making power and have the same standing as House and Senate rules. These provisions typically include procedures for legislative reorganization and specify procedures for congressional action on certain matters. Statutory rule-making provisions in Congress, derived from various legislative acts, regulate congressional procedures and budget processes. The House Manual includes annotations by the parliamentarian on these provisions, with origins in acts like the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and 1970. Some provisions have been incorporated into the Rules of the House, while others have current effects but are not part of the House Rules. The House Manual for the 110th Congress contains statutory legislative procedures that define special procedures for Congress to disapprove or approve actions of the executive branch or independent agencies. These procedures establish expedited processes for enacting joint resolutions of disapproval or approval. The provisions create privileged procedures making approval or disapproval measures privileged for consideration. The Manual is the only document compiling these privileged procedures. The House Manual for the 110th Congress contains statutory legislative procedures that establish privileged procedures for Congress to disapprove or approve actions of the executive branch or independent agencies. These procedures include provisions from various statutes, such as the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The Manual compiles these procedures, some of which are rarely used, and includes rules governing House procedure and congressional budget processes. The House Manual for the 105th Congress outlines rule-making provisions from the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. These provisions establish procedures for considering budgetary legislation in the House and Senate, including special procedures for the budget resolution and reconciliation legislation. The Congressional Budget Act requires Congress to adopt a budget resolution annually to set spending levels. The budget resolution sets congressional spending, revenue, and deficit targets for the fiscal year and allocates spending among budgetary categories. It includes procedural regulations for subsequent action on budget-related measures and becomes effective upon agreement between the two houses. Procedural provisions in budget resolutions operate with the same force as procedural rules of the respective houses and can be altered through the constitutional authority of each house. The budget resolution includes procedural regulations for subsequent budget-related measures, which can be altered through the constitutional authority of each house. These provisions are considered in the report, even though they are not compiled in the House Manual. Procedural provisions in budget resolutions can be temporary or permanent, often concerning Senate procedures and sometimes having bicameral application. They can be identified by examining the texts of adopted congressional budget resolutions for successive years. Many of these provisions establish new points of order against budgetary measures. The congressional budget resolution for FY2008 established limitations on advance appropriations in each house. House precedents are summarized in the parliamentarian's annotations in the House Manual and recorded in the Congressional Record. House precedents are compiled in official publications such as House Practice, Deschler's Precedents, and Cannon's Procedure. The House precedents, including Deschler's, Hinds', and Cannon's Precedents, compile historical precedents and principles of House procedure. These documents provide a digest of current House practice and can be consulted for parliamentary arguments. The most up-to-date publication for House procedures is House Practice. The House Practice publication is the most current reference for House procedure, organized into chapters covering 59 subjects. It was initially prepared by William Holmes Brown and later updated by Charles W. Johnson III to reflect modern House practices. The House Practice publication is the most current reference for House procedure, organized into chapters covering 59 subjects. Each chapter opens with a list of main topics and useful citations to other parliamentary reference sources. The text summarizes relevant House rules and precedents for each main topic and subtopic, providing terminology for parliamentary actions. There is a separate chapter on budgetary legislation titled \"Budget Process.\" The chapter \"Budget Process\" in the House Practice publication provides summaries of rule-making statutes related to the budget process. The index helps readers locate information on specific procedural topics, with detailed listings under each subject heading. Excerpts from the House Practice chapter on the \"Previous Question\" are included, along with significant precedents from Deschler's Precedents. The series, initiated by Lewis Deschler, continues under the Parliamentarian of the House, with 16 volumes published to date. The Deschler-Brown Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, initiated by Lewis Deschler and continued by his successors, covers precedents established after 1936. The series includes 16 volumes, with coverage extending to the 105th Congress. Revisions are planned to incorporate precedents established after the current edition. The Deschler-Brown Precedents of the United States House of Representatives are organized in topical chapters that roughly follow the order of action in the House. Each chapter is divided into numbered topical sections, often grouped under broader headings. Individual precedents are presented in numbered subsections and can be cited by chapter and number.

Some precedents include a \"Parliamentarian's Note\" for clarification or reference to other parliamentary sources. Additionally, Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents provide valuable coverage of the historical origins and evolution of House procedures up to 1936, with volumes authored by Asher Hinds and Clarence Cannon. Volumes 6-8 of Cannon's Precedents serve as a supplement to Hinds' Precedents, with a comprehensive index in volumes 9-11. Both series are organized into topical chapters reflecting House proceedings, with Cannon's Precedents including updates to House procedures. Sections are numbered sequentially and cited by volume and number, with discussions on Rules of the House and their development. The sections in Hinds' Precedents describe procedural exchanges constituting precedents with citations to various sources like the Congressional Record, House Rules, and House committee reports. Each section carries a headnote stating the principle discussed, and specific procedural topics can be located using the detailed table of contents. The comprehensive index to both series (volumes 9-11) arranges topics into numbered subtopics with specific sections identified by volume, number, and headnote. Cannon's Procedure also serves as an index to Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents, which is valuable for understanding House parliamentary procedure. However, readers not familiar with its historical context may find limited practical value in the 11-volume set for contemporary House practices. Procedure is a comprehensive reference source that summarizes important House precedents from 1959 through 1986. It is organized into 37 chapters covering various topics of House procedure, making it a valuable tool for understanding parliamentary procedures in the House.

It includes citations to Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents and the Congressional Record, as well as sample floor dialogues for parliamentary actions. Many of these dialogues are no longer relevant to current House practices. Cannon's Procedure in the House of Representatives provides precedents and sample dialogues for parliamentary actions, but many are no longer relevant. The House's procedures are governed by the Constitution, formal rules, precedents, and informal practices that supplement the rules. These informal practices, though not formally adopted, help determine the actual courses of action taken in the House. The House's procedures are guided by formal rules, precedents, and informal practices that influence the actual courses of action taken. This includes policies announced by the Speaker and memorandums of understanding between committees. These policies, while not official House Rules, reflect the Speaker's authority and are often developed in consultation with leaders of both parties. The Speaker of the House announces policies at the beginning of each new Congress, which are detailed in the Congressional Record and House Calendar. These policies cover various areas such as privileges of the floor, introduction of measures, decorum in debate, and use of electronic devices on the House floor. The House Calendar includes policies on non-legislative debate and committee jurisdiction. Memorandums of understanding clarify jurisdictional issues between committees and advise the Speaker on referring legislation. Referral decisions are based on House Rule X and precedents, with the Speaker and House Parliamentarian involved in the process. Memorandums of understanding play a crucial role in clarifying jurisdictional issues between committees and advising the Speaker on referring legislation. They have increased in importance due to rules changes in the House, such as the elimination of joint referrals and the designation of a \"primary committee\" for measures referred to multiple committees. These memorandums sometimes specify which committees should have \"primary jurisdiction\" over particular issues. The internal structure of the House of Representatives includes committees and party conferences. Committees, established by House Rules, develop legislative proposals, while party conferences assign members to leadership roles. Each group has its own rules, written and adopted individually. Memorandums of understanding clarify jurisdictional issues between committees and advise the Speaker on legislation referrals. The House of Representatives operates with committees and party conferences, each with its own rules. House Rule XI mandates that standing committees must adopt their own written rules of procedure, covering aspects like quorum and voting requirements. These committee rules must align with House Rules and are enforced within the committee. The House of Representatives operates with committees and party conferences, each with its own rules. House Rule XI mandates that standing committees must adopt their own written rules of procedure, covering aspects like quorum and voting requirements. These committee rules are enforced within the committee, but generally not on the House floor. The House Committee on Rules compiles the rules of procedure adopted by all House standing committees in each Congress. The rules of the House Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference are adopted by House Members during early organizational meetings after the November congressional election. These rules, printed and distributed to members, are not official parliamentary reference sources and are not directly enforceable on the House floor. The rules of the House Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference are adopted by House Members after the November congressional election. These rules govern actions within the organizations and can impact House proceedings. Key components include selecting party leaders, assigning members to committees, and setting procedures for floor and committee actions. For example, Rule 38 of Democratic Caucus rules for the 110th Congress outlines restrictions on considering legislation under certain conditions. The House Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference rules, adopted after the November election, govern party actions and impact House proceedings. Rule 28 of the Republican Conference imposes restrictions on requests costing over $100 million. Various House publications provide valuable information on parliamentary procedures.
