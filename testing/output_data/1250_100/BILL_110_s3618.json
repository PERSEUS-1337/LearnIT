    "content": "The Act titled \"Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008\" focuses on advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicle technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program. Definitions in this section include terms like \"advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle,\" \"greenhouse gas,\" \"plug-in hybrid vehicle,\" \"program,\" and \"retrofit.\" The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to provide grants for projects advancing research and development of advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Selection criteria will be based on the ability of applicants to complete program phases successfully. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to provide grants for projects advancing research and development of advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Applicants must prioritize filling research gaps, achieving technological advances, and reducing fuel consumption and emissions. Projects can be carried out in partnership with other entities. The Secretary will publish a request for applications within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will select grant applicants through a competitive process within 90 days of the application deadline. The number of grants awarded will be based on technical merits, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 grants. At least half of the grants will promote plug-in hybrid vehicle technology. The Secretary will award grant amounts accordingly. The Secretary will award up to $3,000,000 per year for a 3-year project. Grant recipients must complete 2 phases, with phase 1 involving research and demonstration of advanced hybrid technology in heavy-duty vehicles. A report on vehicle performance must be submitted to the Secretary within 60 days of phase 1 completion. The Secretary may terminate the grant program if the recipient cannot complete phase 2 requirements. Phase 1 lasts for 1 year and involves testing components, projected costs, and emission levels of each vehicle. The Secretary will develop standard testing procedures for vehicle performance. In phase 2, recipients must demonstrate advanced manufacturing processes by producing 50 hybrid vehicles and submit a report on technological challenges faced. In phase 2 of the program, recipients must mass produce 50 hybrid vehicles and provide details on manufacturing costs, sale prices, and comparison with non-hybrid vehicles. The research conducted by the Secretary focuses on alternative power train designs for heavy-duty hybrid vehicles, comparing costs and performance with nonhybrid designs under typical usage conditions. The Secretary must report to Congress within 60 days of receiving grant reports, detailing grant recipients, project funding, applicant data, vehicle fuel efficiency analysis, and research results. Coordination and avoiding duplication of efforts are emphasized by the Secretary. The Secretary must coordinate activities and avoid duplication with other programs. Cost sharing applies to the program. A pilot program will research the impact of plug-in hybrid vehicles on the electric grid. $16,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009-2011, with limitations on fund usage for research. The Secretary is authorized to carry out research, pilot programs, and administer the program. SEC. 3. EXPANDING RESEARCH IN HYBRID TECHNOLOGY FOR LARGE VEHICLES. Amends the United States Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007 to include vehicles over 16,000 pounds in research for hybrid technology."
