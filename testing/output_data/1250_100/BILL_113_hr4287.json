    "content": "The \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" may extend the patent term for using biological products. The \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" allows for a 5-year extension of a patent for using biological products, provided certain conditions are met. The extension application must be submitted by the patent owner or agent, and the patent term must not have expired or been previously extended. The application should include details of the biological product and the specific patent claims being extended. The \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" requires proof that the patent was issued to an independent innovator or a qualified small business with an ownership interest. Additionally, an application for commercial marketing of the biological product must have been filed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act, with a minimum of 10 years between the original submission for investigating the method of use and the application for exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" requires proof of patent ownership by an independent innovator or qualified small business. The Director determines patent extension eligibility based on application representations. If eligible, a 5-year extension certificate is issued. The Director can extend the term of a patent for up to one year if an application for extension is pending. Definitions include \"biological product\" and \"Director.\" An \"independent innovator\" is defined as a person or entity. The term \"qualified small business\" refers to an entity with fewer than 500 employees, not affiliated with the holder of a marketing application approved under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act. Affiliation includes relationships of employment, control, or common ownership. Section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act allows for the commercial marketing of biological products. This section will be effective on the enactment date of the Act and applies to any unexpired patents issued before or after that date."
