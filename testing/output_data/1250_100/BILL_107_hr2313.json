The \"Crane Tithe Tax Act of 2001\" repeals various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to corporate taxation. This includes the repeal of corporate income tax, alternative minimum tax for corporations, unrelated business income tax, accumulated earnings tax, personal holding company tax, and taxes imposed on insurance companies, investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and foreign corporations with US business connections. SEC. 3. 10 PERCENT INCOME TAX RATE FOR INDIVIDUALS. Amendment to Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a 10 percent income tax rate for individuals. A 10 percent income tax is imposed on individuals based on earned income exceeding the exemption amount, which is $10,000 adjusted for inflation annually. The term 'CPI' refers to the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. Any increase not a multiple of $10 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Earned income includes wages, self-employment earnings, and certain dividends. The term 'earned income' excludes pension, annuity, and discretionary tips, but includes fringe benefits at employer cost. SEC. 4 grants amnesty for all prior tax liability before January 1, 2000, with exceptions for amounts paid before the enactment of the Act and taxes related to illegal activities. SEC. 5 repeals special deductions, credits, and exclusions from income for individuals. SEC. 6 repeals estate and gift taxes. SEC. 7 of the Act specifies that the amendments will apply to taxable years after the enactment date, with exceptions for estate and gift taxes which will apply to estates of decedents dying after the enactment date. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit any necessary technical changes to the Internal Revenue Code within 90 days of the enactment."
