    "content": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reformed patent and food and drug laws to balance innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Congressional focus has shifted to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, where brand-name companies enforce patents against generic competitors through federal court litigation. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve the brand-name company making cash payments to the generic firm in exchange for the generic firm not challenging the patents or selling a generic version of the drug. These settlements, also known as \"pay-for-delay\" agreements, have sparked debate among observers, with some viewing them as a result of specialized patent litigation procedures and others as anti-competitive violations of antitrust laws. Congress has required litigants to notify federal antitrust authorities of such settlements since 2003. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. on June 17, 2013, established that reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach. This ruling clarified the legality of such agreements, which involve brand-name companies making cash payments to generic firms to delay the release of generic drugs. Lower courts now face the challenge of applying this standard to future cases, while legislation before Congress, such as the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act (S. 214), also addresses reverse payment settlements. The FAIR Generics Act (S. 504) and the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act (S. 214) aim to address reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. These bills introduce reforms to reduce incentives for generic firms to settle with brand-name companies. The legislation is still pending enactment. The report discusses innovation and competition policy issues related to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, including the concept of reverse payment settlements and their status under antitrust laws. It also highlights the process of patent application submission to the USPTO for patent protection. When submitting a patent application to the USPTO, applicants must provide a detailed specification and at least one claim defining their invention. The examiner will assess the invention's novelty and nonobviousness based on prior art. If granted, the patent owner gains exclusive rights to the invention. The patent owner gains exclusive rights to the invention, allowing them to sell, offer, or import the invention in the United States for a period of twenty years. Patent title provides inventors with limited exclusivity to practice their inventions or license others to do so. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement and may need to litigate to enforce their rights. However, FDA permission is required before distributing a patented pharmaceutical product to the public. Before distributing a patented pharmaceutical product, FDA approval is necessary. To obtain FDA marketing approval, developers must demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the new drug through preclinical and clinical investigations submitted in a New Drug Application (NDA). Prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic drug manufacturers had to file their own NDAs to sell their products, sometimes relying on published literature for approval. However, not all generic firms could use this method, and additional studies were sometimes requested by the FDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act was enacted to address safety and efficacy concerns with generic drugs. It created an expedited approval pathway for generic drugs called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). This allowed generic manufacturers to prove bioequivalence to approved pioneer drugs without redundant safety and efficacy studies. The availability of ANDAs allows generic manufacturers to avoid costs and delays associated with filing a full NDA. Congress provided patent proprietors with a means for restoring a portion of the patent term lost while awaiting FDA approval, with a maximum extension period of five years. This extension is intended to compensate brand-name firms for the pre-clinical and clinical data generated for the product. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug marketing applications. NDA applicants must list patents they believe would be infringed by generic drugs in the \"Orange Book.\" Generic manufacturers must certify their views on these patents in their ANDA applications. The ANDA applicant must certify their views on Orange Book-listed patents associated with the drug they seek to market, with four possibilities: (1) no patent information filed, (2) expired patent, (3) agreement not to market until patent expiration, or (4) invalid or non-infringing patent. Certifications are termed paragraph I, II, III, and IV. Approval for paragraphs I or II is immediate, while paragraph III requires waiting for patent expiration. Paragraph IV certification constitutes an act of patent infringement under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act incentivizes challenges to pharmaceutical patents by granting a 180-day exclusivity period to the first generic applicant filing a paragraph IV certification. This provision aims to stimulate patent challenges and competition in the market. Amendments in 2003 introduced circumstances where the first applicant may lose this exclusivity period. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established forfeiture events for generic exclusivity, such as failure to market promptly or obtain FDA approval in a timely manner. This was to prevent 'parking' of exclusivity periods. Generic firms filing a paragraph IV ANDA may face patent infringement suits, leading to injunctions preventing marketing of the product until the NDA holder's patents expire. Generic drug companies often amend their ANDAs, replacing paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III certifications. If the courts rule in favor of the independent generic firm, they may launch their product once FDA approval is obtained. Pharmaceutical patent litigation can also result in settlements where the generic firm agrees not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug in exchange for compensation from the NDA holder. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve the NDA holder compensating the ANDA applicant to avoid litigation expenses and achieve a timely resolution. Opinions on the anticompetitive nature of these settlements vary, with some believing it restricts output and profits, while others see it as a way to promote settlement and preserve judicial resources. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve compensating the defendant to avoid litigation expenses and achieve a timely resolution. Settlement agreements between rational actors involve an exchange of benefits and obligations, potentially allowing for generic competition before the patent expires. These agreements may benefit consumers and promote settlement while preserving judicial resources. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, settlements involve compensating the accused infringer to avoid injunction and damages. The Hatch-Waxman Act alters the balance of risks between patentee and infringer, allowing generic manufacturers to challenge validity without risking infringement damages. This scheme limits the generic firm's exposure to litigation costs while offering immense upside in exclusive generic sales. The patent holder, on the other hand, has no infringement damages to collect. Some commentators believe that the unique procedures of the Hatch-Waxman Act have led to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congressional action on these settlements has been limited, with the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug Act mandating the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field. These agreements trigger notification requirements if they relate to specific topics related to brand-name and generic drugs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act mandated the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field. The MMA imposed a filing obligation on certain patent settlements, but did not set substantive standards for their validity. Various government and private actors asserted that some reverse payment settlements violated antitrust laws, leading to different courts applying general antitrust principles to resolve claims. The report reviews judicial opinions on reverse payment settlements in antitrust law. The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, prohibit anti-competitive conduct. Courts determine unreasonable restraints of trade using the \"rule of reason.\" The \"rule of reason\" is used to determine if a practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition by considering various factors. Per se illegality applies to restraints that are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and illegal without further inquiry. Antitrust violations include price fixing, group boycotts, and market division. Courts may use a \"quick look\" approach between per se illegality and rule of reason standards. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation have faced differing antitrust scrutiny, with some courts holding them per se invalid. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals was per se invalid as a horizontal agreement, a restraint of trade involving businesses at the same level of competition. However, subsequent Courts of Appeals reached different conclusions, allowing reverse payment settlements as long as they do not exceed the scope of the patent. For example, in Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Eleventh Circuit reversed a district court's decision, stating that per se illegality was premature and inappropriate. The Court of Appeals remanded the matter for a determination of whether any part of the agreement exceeded the protections afforded by the brand-name firm's patent. Reverse payment settlements are permitted as long as they do not extend beyond the scope of the patent, the patent infringement claim was not baseless, and the patent was not obtained fraudulently. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test, stating that it improperly restricts antitrust law and goes against the policies of the Hatch-Waxman Act and Supreme Court precedent on patent litigation and competition. The Court of Appeals criticized the scope of the patent test for giving too much weight to the presumption of validity granted to patents. They adopted a \"quick rule of reason\" test that presumed reverse payments were anticompetitive, allowing parties to rebut this by showing pro-competitive benefits. This led to a conflict between lower courts, prompting the Supreme Court to hear the case of Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. The Supreme Court heard the case of Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc., where reverse payment settlements were evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach. The FTC charged the settling parties with unlawfully sharing in monopoly profits and refraining from launching generic products to compete with AndroGel for nine years. The District Court and Eleventh Circuit rejected the FTC's claims. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the rejection of the FTC's claims regarding reverse payment settlements. The Supreme Court later reversed the judgment, stating that anticompetitive effects falling within the scope of a patent do not immunize agreements from antitrust scrutiny. The Court highlighted that litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act may result in the patent holder losing the right to exclude generic products from the market. The Supreme Court ruled that anticompetitive effects within a patent do not protect agreements from antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer emphasized the need to consider traditional antitrust factors in evaluating patent-related settlements. The Court highlighted the importance of assessing likely anticompetitive effects, redeeming virtues, market power, and other legal considerations in such cases. The Supreme Court ruled that reverse payment settlements in patent disputes should be subject to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer outlined five considerations supporting this decision, including the risk of anticompetitive effects, inability to justify large payments, market power from patents, and the possibility of settling disputes without such payments. These factors outweigh the desirability of settlements that led to near-automatic antitrust immunity in the Eleventh Circuit. The Supreme Court ruled that reverse payment settlements in patent disputes should be subject to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer declined to adopt the Commission's suggestion of presumptively unlawful settlements and emphasized the need for a traditional rule of reason analysis to establish antitrust liability. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, arguing that antitrust law should only be violated in specific circumstances related to the scope of the patent or fraud. The Supreme Court's ruling on reverse payment settlements in patent disputes subjects them to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer emphasized the need for a traditional rule of reason analysis, while Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, arguing that antitrust law should only be violated in specific circumstances related to the scope of the patent or fraud. The dissenters expressed concerns about discouraging generic firms from challenging patents and weakening patent protection for innovators. The Court's opinion in Actavis does not eliminate the ability to settle litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act, but parties must carefully structure and explain their agreements. Existing agreements will require lower courts to apply the rule of reason in Hatch-Waxman cases, with differing views on the role of patent validity and infringement in antitrust disputes. Resolution of antitrust issues and infringement is complex and costly. Congress has options to address this, including waiting for judicial developments or regulating pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act in the 113th Congress aims to declare certain settlements as acts of unfair competition. It would presume anticompetitive effects if an ANDA filer receives anything of value and agrees to limit research or sales of the product. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, aims to discourage reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It grants generic firms the right to share regulatory exclusivity and obligates them to abide by settlement terms, while requiring brand-name firms to enforce patents within 45 days of a challenge. This legislation addresses the complexities and costs of resolving antitrust issues and infringement in the pharmaceutical industry. Patent litigation is crucial for our public health system as it involves brand-name and generic drug companies. The Hatch-Waxman Act mediates disputes between these rivals, aiming to balance innovation and consumer access to medications. Settlements that align with antitrust principles can promote medical innovation and benefit consumers."
