    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the exclusion, forced removal, and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC conducted hearings across the country, gathering information from over 750 witnesses, resulting in the reports \"Personal Justice Denied\" and \"Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations\" in 1983. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was not justified by military necessity but driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, acknowledging the grave personal injustice done to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II, apologizing for the violation of their civil liberties and constitutional rights. The actions were driven by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria, resulting in significant human suffering. Appropriate compensation has not been made for the damages incurred. The Legislature aims to establish a state test for eligible aliens seeking permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This test would assess their understanding of English, history, and government of the United States to meet federal requirements. The Legislature intends to create a state test for eligible undocumented foreign nationals seeking permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This test would evaluate their knowledge of English, history, and government of the United States to meet federal requirements. The Superintendent, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, will develop a test to measure the English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government for eligible foreign nationals seeking permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Governor, Superintendent, Chancellor, Senate President pro Tempore, and Assembly Speaker will petition for approval to use this test as a requirement. The Superintendent distributes a test to assess English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government for eligible foreign nationals seeking legal status. Test results are confidential and can only be released with written consent for educational purposes. Test results for eligible foreign nationals seeking legal status may be shared with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. Schools and agencies receiving federal funds must administer the test securely. Section 52613 of the Education Code is amended to require school districts enrolling nonimmigrant foreign nationals to charge a fee covering the full costs of instruction, not exceeding the actual cost. The fee must be adopted by the governing board at least 90 days before classes begin. Section 52651 of the Education Code defines key terms for the chapter, including \"Board of Governors,\" \"Chancellor,\" \"Community-based organizations,\" \"Department,\" and \"Educational outreach activities.\" Educational outreach activities refer to providing information to temporary resident foreign nationals about federal immigration laws, assistance for adjusting resident status, rights and responsibilities, health, employment, and social services. It excludes client counseling and assuming responsibility for residency applications. Additionally, it includes informing newly legalized individuals and other immigrants about educational opportunities available to them. (f) An immigrant is a person from a country other than the US eligible for education services in California or a naturalized US citizen residing in California. \n(g) A newly legalized person is a foreign national granted lawful temporary resident status under specific US Code sections or who has obtained permanent resident or citizenship status after temporary residency.\n(h) A services provider is an approved organization or institution eligible to provide educational services to newly legalized persons.\n(i) SLIAG refers to State Legalization Impact-Assistance Grants under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Education Code is amended to define residence rules, including the establishment of residence by individuals and the residence of unmarried minor children. A woman's residence is not derivative from her husband's. The Education Code is amended to define residence rules, including establishing residence for unmarried minor foreign nationals. A student meeting specific requirements is exempt from paying nonresident tuition at California State University and Community Colleges. To be exempt from nonresident tuition at California State University and Community Colleges, a student must meet criteria such as attending high school in California for three years, graduating from a California high school, enrolling in an accredited institution of higher education in California, and filing an affidavit if without lawful immigration status. This exemption allows the student to be reported as a full-time equivalent student for funding purposes. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Trustees of the California State University will set rules for this section. Student information collected is confidential. Amendments to the Education Code exempt reparation payments for Japanese ancestry interned during World War II from being considered in financial need assessments. The Superintendent of Public Instruction must certify the enactment of specific federal legislation for certain sections of the act to become operative. This legislation replaces the term \"alien\" with \"foreign national\" and \"illegal alien\" with \"undocumented foreign national\" in government language. If certification is made, a section of the act becomes inoperative."
