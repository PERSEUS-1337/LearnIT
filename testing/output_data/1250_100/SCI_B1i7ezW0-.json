    "content": "A new semi-supervised learning framework is developed using an inversion scheme for deep neural networks, applicable to various systems and problems. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST and shows promising performance on SVHN and CIFAR10 datasets. It introduces the use of residual networks for semi-supervised tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness on one-dimensional signals. This method is simple, efficient, and does not require changes to the network architecture. Semi-supervised learning allows for training with both labeled and unlabeled data, improving generalization and reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Limited progress has been made on semi-supervised learning algorithms for DNNs, but current methods have drawbacks such as training instability, lack of topology generalization, and computational complexity. This paper introduces a universal methodology to equip any deep neural net with an inverse for input reconstruction and a new semi-supervised learning approach that incorporates information from unlabeled data into the learning process. The key insight is the simplicity and general applicability of the defined inverse function, allowing for error minimization without extra cost or model changes. The standard approach to DNN inversion for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning is based on autoencoders. The semi-supervised ladder network approach employs per-layer denoising reconstruction loss, turning a deep unsupervised model into a semi-supervised model. The probabilistic formulation of deep convolutional nets natively supports semi-supervised learning. The main drawbacks of the deep convolutional nets approach for semi-supervised learning lie in the requirement of ReLU activation functions and a specific network topology. Temporal Ensembling and Distributional Smoothing with Virtual Adversarial Training propose techniques to improve semi-supervised learning by ensuring stability in representations and regularity in the DNN mapping for unlabeled samples. These methods are similar to the proposed approach in this paper, focusing on DNN stability. The paper proposes a new approach for semi-supervised learning by focusing on the reconstruction ability of deep neural networks (DNNs). It introduces a simple way to invert any piecewise differentiable mapping, including DNNs, without changing their structure. The method is computationally optimal and improves significantly on the state-of-the-art for various DNN topologies. Additionally, the work of BID1 is reviewed, showing that DNNs can be interpreted as linear splines, providing a mathematical justification for the reconstruction in deep learning. The paper introduces a new approach for semi-supervised learning by focusing on the reconstruction ability of deep neural networks (DNNs). It shows that DNNs can be approximated closely by multivariate linear splines, enabling the derivation of an explicit input-output mapping formula. DNNs can be rewritten as a linear spline, with specific input-output mappings provided for different topologies. The differences between standard deep convolutional neural networks (DCN) and Resnet DNN templates are briefly observed. The paper introduces a new approach for semi-supervised learning by focusing on the reconstruction ability of deep neural networks (DNNs). It shows that DNNs can be approximated closely by multivariate linear splines, enabling the derivation of an explicit input-output mapping formula. The differences between standard deep convolutional neural networks (DCN) and Resnet DNN templates are briefly observed. The presence of an extra term in the templates provides stability and a direct linear connection between the input and inner representations, minimizing information loss sensitivity to nonlinear activations. Optimal templates for prediction in DNNs are proportional to the input, positively for the belonging class and negatively for others. The loss cross-entropy function is minimized using softmax final nonlinearity. Theoretical optimal templates imply reconstruction in DNNs. Based on theoretical optimal templates of DNNs, an inverse reconstruction method leveraging input hyperplanes is proposed. This method provides a reconstruction based on DNN representation, distinct from exact input reconstruction. The bias correction is compared to known frameworks, showing similarities to soft-thresholding denoising techniques. Further details on inverting networks and semi-supervised applications are provided in the next section. The inverse strategy is applied to tasks with arbitrary DNNs, with changes made to support semi-supervised learning in the training function. In our application, semi-supervised learning is achieved by modifying the objective loss function using automatic differentiation. This allows for efficient updates in deep networks by rewriting them as linear mappings. The reconstruction error plays a key role in defining the inverse transform for various frameworks, enabling the computation of the matrix efficiently. The reconstruction loss is a key component in semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. It is combined with a \"specialization\" loss, which forces clustering of unlabeled examples towards learned clusters. The complete loss function includes cross entropy for labeled data, reconstruction loss, and entropy loss with adjustable parameters for weighting the losses. The unsupervised loss and the ratio \u03b2 between the two unsupervised losses are crucial for guiding learning towards a better optimum. Results of our approach on a semi-supervised task on the MNIST dataset show reasonable performances with different topologies. The dataset consists of 70000 grayscale images split into a training set of 60000 images and a test set of 10000 images. We focus on the case with N L = 50 labeled samples from the training set, while the rest are unlabeled and used for reconstruction and entropy loss minimization. Different combinations of (\u03b1, \u03b2) and 4 topologies, including mean and max pooling, are tested along with inhibitor DNN (IDNN) to stabilize training and remove biases units. The Resnet topologies show the best performance, with wide Resnet outperforming previous state-of-the-art results. The proposed semi-supervised scheme on MNIST yields results in Tab. 2 using Theano and Lasagne libraries. Results on CIFAR10 with 4000 labeled data and SVHN with 500 labeled data are presented in Tabs 3 and 4, respectively. The study includes deep CNN models and explores the impact of different loss functions and activation functions. The text chunk discusses the use of various neural network models for a supervised task on audio data, specifically classifying bird species based on their songs. Different models and their validation accuracies are compared, showing that regularized networks tend to generalize better than non-regularized ones. The training process involves varying parameters over multiple runs to optimize performance. The text chunk presents an inversion scheme for deep neural networks applied to semi-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on MNIST. It suggests extending the reconstruction loss to a per-layer basis for better flexibility and meaningful reconstruction, especially for noisy input datasets. The text chunk discusses updating weighting coefficients during learning, optimizing hyper-parameters through backpropagation, and using adversarial training to accelerate learning in deep neural networks. It also mentions EBGANs as GANs where the discriminant network measures the energy of input data. The authors propose a new method to compute the energy function of input data in network D, aiming to reduce the parameters needed for reconstruction. Their approach allows for unsupervised tasks like clustering, with the ability to control the reconstruction quality through parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2. This method differs from a deep autoencoder by considering only the final output in the reconstruction loss and incorporating \"activation\" sharing for both forward and backward passes.
