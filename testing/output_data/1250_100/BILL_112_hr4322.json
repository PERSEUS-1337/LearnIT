    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during hydraulic fracturing, citing reports from the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency have found no evidence of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing, as stated in various reports and testimonies. In 2011, Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey stated that there have been no adverse effects from the chemicals used in fracking. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are regulated at the Federal level under environmental statutes, but Congress has chosen not to include it in the underground injection control program. In the same year, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on fracking. The Bureau of Land Management Director stated in 2011 that there have been no adverse effects from chemicals used in fracking. Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing were planned by the Secretary of the Interior in the same year. A study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from fracking fluid in aquifers. Federal land is defined as public lands, National Forest System land, land under the Bureau of Reclamation, and land under the Corps of Engineers. States have sole authority to regulate underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing within their boundaries. On Federal land, state laws apply to hydraulic fracturing activities."
