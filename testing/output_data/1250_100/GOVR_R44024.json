    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amended TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate. Since the enactment of TSCA in 1976, there is ongoing legislative debate on amending the evaluation process and regulatory criteria for chemicals. Proponents argue that the current framework is not sufficiently protective, leading to different state regulations for the same chemicals, which manufacturers find inefficient. EPA's evaluation of risks depends on available resources, with states enacting statutes to address specific chemical concerns not covered by TSCA. The 114th Congress is considering bills to amend Title I of TSCA, with different state regulations for chemicals causing debate. Non-governmental programs offer alternative approaches to regulation, such as voluntary labeling. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act have been introduced for consideration. The Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) was introduced and referred to Senate EPW. Senate EPW held a hearing on S. 697 on March 18, 2015. An amendment for S. 697 was marked up on April 28, 2015, and reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which was forwarded to the full committee for consideration. H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced on May 26, 2015. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce approved the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 with technical amendments on a 47-0 vote. The House passed H.R. 2576 under suspension of the rules on a 398-1 vote. Key debated issues include prioritizing existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting chemicals, EPA's options for regulation, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information to EPA, and EPA's resources for administering the act. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues related to evaluating risks for chemicals in the marketplace. EPA has discretion in selecting chemicals for evaluation under the current TSCA, with over 83,000 chemical substances potentially subject to evaluation. In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for evaluation based on prioritization criteria. The EPA prioritized 90 chemical substances for risk evaluation, assessing five with three presenting risks. For new chemicals, Section 5 of TSCA requires a PMN submission to EPA 90 days prior to manufacturing, allowing EPA to assess risks. EPA received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. Different bills propose various approaches to prioritize and evaluate existing chemical substances for risks. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 propose different criteria for prioritizing and evaluating chemical substances for potential risks. The bills aim to divide existing substances into active and inactive categories, conduct risk-based safety evaluations, and take regulatory action based on the results. Manufacturers can request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee, with EPA having discretion to grant a limited number of requests. Under H.R. 2576, EPA would evaluate risks for substances requested by manufacturers who have paid for the evaluation. S. 697 and S. 725 establish prioritization processes with deadlines for evaluating and taking regulatory actions on chemical substances. EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority under S. 697 and begin safety assessments within five years. Safety assessments must be completed within three years of designation, with a rule promulgated within two years of a negative safety determination. The procedures under S. 725 are similar to those under S. 697. H.R. 2576 requires risk evaluations to be published within three years of a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk. EPA must initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they pay for the evaluation. S. 697 and S. 725 propose assessment procedures for new chemical substances, while H.R. 2576 does not amend the current process for EPA to evaluate risks based on when a notice is submitted. EPA would need to determine if regulatory action is necessary under the Senate bills. Under the Senate bills, EPA would need to determine if regulatory action is warranted for new chemicals within 90 days of receiving a PMN. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to the same safety assessment procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA standard for regulation is based on whether the chemical poses an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. Some argue that the existing regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals in TSCA is difficult for EPA to show and subject to interpretation. The debate revolves around amending the threshold to clarify criteria for determining if substances warrant regulatory control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is not defined in statute but interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately, leading to a conclusion that spending $200-$300 million to save seven lives over thirteen years was not reasonable under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard. S. 697 aims to define \"safety standard\" in TSCA, incorporating qualifiers to assess the risks and benefits of chemical substances. S. 697 and S. 725 aim to establish a safety standard for evaluating chemical risks, with a focus on protecting potentially exposed populations. S. 697 explicitly prohibits considering cost and non-risk factors in risk evaluations, while S. 725 emphasizes ensuring no harm to human health or the environment under intended conditions of use. In contrast, H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors. EPA is directed to promulgate requirements to protect against unreasonable risks using the least burdensome approach under TSCA Section 6. The EPA must protect against risks using the least burdensome requirement, considering costs and alternatives. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's total ban on asbestos lacked substantial evidence as the least burdensome option. This requirement adds an extra standard for EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. EPA must justify choosing a more burdensome requirement over a less burdensome one. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to justify choosing a more burdensome regulatory option over a less burdensome one. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome requirement for restricting chemical substances. Instead, they propose options that are \"necessary\" for meeting safety standards, considering costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 would also focus on protecting potentially exposed subpopulations and ensuring cost-effective rules, with EPA having the authority to exempt certain chemical substance uses from restrictions. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 authorize EPA to grant exemptions for certain chemical substance uses if national security, the economy, or critical infrastructure are at risk. EPA can provide \"critical use exemptions\" if a requirement is not cost-effective and if no safer alternative is available. These exemptions aim to reduce risk and can be renewed for up to five years if criteria are met. EPA relies on scientific and technical information for decision-making. EPA can grant exemptions for certain chemical uses based on national security, the economy, or critical infrastructure risks. The agency relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and determine if they are unreasonable. Section 8 of TSCA allows EPA to require reporting and record-keeping of existing information on chemicals. If testing is needed to gather new risk information, Section 4 mandates manufacturers and processors to conduct testing if certain threshold findings are met. EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances. Limits on EPA's authority under TSCA have hindered its ability to assess chemical risks. EPA faces challenges in requiring new information on chemicals, as it can be time-consuming and costly. Proposed Senate bills would give EPA discretion to mandate testing, while H.R. 2576 still requires specific findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. EPA can grant exemptions for certain chemical uses based on national security or economic reasons. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and determine if they are unreasonable. EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances. The proposed Senate bills would authorize EPA to require new information on chemicals for risk evaluation under TSCA Section 6. State chemical regulations have influenced discussions on TSCA preemption, with EPA having a primary role but states retaining some authority in setting their own requirements. The TSCA amendment allows states some authority in managing chemicals, with exceptions to federal preemption. States can enforce identical federal requirements, regulate disposal, and prohibit certain chemical uses within the state. Advocates for federal preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework to avoid conflicting state regulations. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management, allowing states to act if EPA has not taken action on a chemical. The bill would change the EPA actions triggering preemption, the scope of state laws preempted, and waiver provisions. States could not restrict chemicals EPA found safe or restricted by rule, but could still experiment with more stringent policies to protect citizens. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption, prohibiting states from establishing new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority for safety assessment by EPA. Preemption exceptions would be retained, except for the current exception allowing states to prohibit chemical use. States could still enforce requirements identical to federal ones but not impose duplicative or stricter measures. S. 697 would refine TSCA preemption by adding new provisions to limit states from imposing duplicate or stricter penalties. Exceptions would allow states to enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. Past state actions before August 1, 2015, and actions under laws in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be preempted. The bill would also allow states to apply for waivers based on peer-reviewed science, with EPA required to grant waivers meeting statutory requirements. S. 725 would eliminate TSCA's preemption provisions, allowing states to impose different regulations for chemicals. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to preemption, maintaining preemption for chemicals EPA deems safe. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption under H.R. 2576. H.R. 2576 would add language allowing states to enforce their own requirements identical to EPA's, with penalties. It also includes savings clauses for common law causes of action. TSCA requires chemical information submission to EPA, balancing public access with protection of competitive information. TSCA Section 14 prohibits disclosure of confidential business information (CBI) that could compromise competitiveness, with exceptions for health and safety concerns. EPA employees or contractors face criminal charges for wrongful disclosure. Chemical identities and proprietary information are protected as CBI. Disclosure may be required if necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify information submitters before disclosing information designated as CBI. Submitters only need to label information as CBI for protection, without requiring substantiation. CBI protection lasts indefinitely unless EPA determines otherwise. EPA has increased review of confidentiality claims since 2010, including a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to encourage voluntary withdrawal of CBI claims. All three proposed bills maintain TSCA's framework for protecting information under the FOIA trade secrets exemption. The three proposals would expand EPA's ability to disclose CBI in certain circumstances, including requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, requests from professionals in response to environmental releases, and requests from healthcare professionals for patient diagnoses or treatments. The Senate bills propose more detailed procedural requirements and review processes compared to H.R. 2576. They also outline categories of information presumed protected from disclosure, such as specific chemical identities before commercial distribution. H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting chemical identities in health and safety studies. All three bills require submitters to substantiate information every 10 years. H.R. 2576 proposes limited substantiation requirements for confidentiality claims made after enactment, along with notifying submitters before claim expiration. Congress faces a decision on funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or establishing dedicated funding sources. Appropriations for TSCA were authorized through FY1983, with continued funding through annual appropriations and the authorization for EPA to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. EPA has the authority to assess fees on manufacturers, importers, or processors under Section 5 of the statute, with a maximum limit of $2,500 per action. Small businesses have a fee limit of $100. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Availability of fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. The bills S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under Section 29 of TSCA, while H.R. 2576 would not amend Section 29. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under Section 26(b) of TSCA to varying degrees. S. 697 would authorize the collection of fees for submissions of information to EPA, with fees set to provide a sustainable source of funds capped at $18 million. EPA would deposit fee receipts into a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 propose to authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for evaluating submissions of information related to chemical substances. The bills aim to establish a dedicated fund for fee receipts without fiscal year limitation, subject to appropriations. The fees collected would be used to defray certain costs in administering TSCA. S. 725 does not establish a dedicated account for fee deposits, with collected fees going into the General Fund. Cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576 have been published by the Congressional Budget Office."
