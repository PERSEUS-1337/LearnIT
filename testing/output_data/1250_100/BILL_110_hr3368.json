    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal condition where the blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. The walls of the arteries that take blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs thicken and constrict, causing the right side of the heart to enlarge and ultimately fail. Collaboration among top pulmonary hypertension research centers must be increased to find a cure or effective treatment. Pulmonary hypertension remains difficult to diagnose and is often confused with other heart and lung conditions, but new diagnostic standards have improved diagnosis rates. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981, following 194 patients over several years. Research is focusing on immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of the disease. Research on pulmonary hypertension is progressing, leading to advancements in treatments. There are currently six FDA-approved medications with more in trials, but not all are effective for all patients. These treatments have significant side effects impacting quality of life. Lung transplantation is a last resort option. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has significantly increased over the past decade, highlighting the need for more education for medical professionals. In 2006, there were 3,000 physicians and 30,000 patients involved in pulmonary hypertension treatment. Despite the availability of oral therapies, managing the disease remains complex. A meeting hosted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute emphasized the importance of communication among researchers for future advancements in treating pulmonary hypertension. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on pulmonary hypertension research and training. The Director of the Institute will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct clinical trials and collaborate on new treatment approaches for pulmonary hypertension. The network will include 15 clinical centers, an institute project scientist, and a data and coordinating center. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network includes a data and safety monitoring board, a steering committee, and an independent protocol review committee appointed by the Director. The steering committee determines specific clinical trials, establishes standards for subject selection, develops protocols, and analyzes results, including combination therapies for pulmonary hypertension. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network focuses on combination therapies, new drug avenues, use of endothelial progenitor cells, and predictive treatment effects. The Institute manages program appointments and supports the network, with the project scientist monitoring trial progress and conflicts of interest. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network focuses on clinical trials adherence to Institute policies, fiscal management with grants specialist, and appointments by the Director for committee roles. The Institute supports the network, with the project scientist overseeing trial progress and conflicts of interest. The Director of the Institute will establish a national Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program to educate medical professionals in diagnosing and managing pulmonary hypertension. The program aims to increase the number of trained physicians in the United States. The program aims to establish regional training sites across the United States at recognized health centers, hospitals, or medical practices for educating health professionals in pulmonary hypertension. Each site will have a designated contact and receive a stipend from grant funds. The nonprofit entity awarded the grant will be responsible for participant recruitment and program guidelines in collaboration with the regional training sites and the Institute. Authorization of appropriations is provided for program implementation. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of the program, with necessary funds authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension is emphasized in Section 4. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, incidence, diseases that can lead to it, importance of early diagnosis, and treatment options. Information will be disseminated through a national non-profit entity. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to health professionals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to health care providers, including warning signs, early diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and approved therapies. This information will be shared through a national non-profit entity with expertise in pulmonary hypertension. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 as necessary. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, including all FDA-approved therapies. The study will consider outpatient or home health care settings for service delivery. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment."
