    "content": "There is no relevant information provided in the prev_chunk to summarize the curr_chunk. If an eligible employer elects subsection (b), their liability with respect to the applicable pension plan will be determined under subsection (b). If they do not make this election, their liability will be determined under subsection (c). If the employer elects within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, the applicable pension plan will be treated as spun off to an eligible spunoff plan, and the employer's liability will be determined by reference to the eligible spunoff plan. The employer's liability, as determined under subsection (b), will be in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. For employers electing spinoff, ongoing funding liability will apply until the plan ceases to be an eligible spunoff plan. The employer's liability, as determined under subsection (b), will be subject to the same conditions as under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This liability shall be in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The interest rate for this liability will be determined according to specific sections of the mentioned acts. The liability of the employer maintaining an eligible spunoff plan, if it terminates before December 31, 2010, will be determined according to specific sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The interest rate used in such cases will be the third segment rate determined under certain sections of the Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Employers not electing spinoff are liable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for the unfunded benefit liabilities of the terminated pension plan as of December 31, 2005. The text chunk discusses the transfer of unfunded benefit liabilities to an eligible spunoff plan, defining terms like \"adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities\" and \"fractional portion.\" The curr_chunk discusses the definition of terms related to applicable pension plans, including \"applicable pension plan\" and \"allocable portion.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the requirements for eligible employers making an election under subsection (b). The curr_chunk defines an \"eligible employer\" as a participant in an eligible multiple employer plan after January 1, 2000. It calculates the excess of plan liabilities over assets to determine the employer's share."
