    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve new construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations. The NSR process is triggered for any new source potentially emitting 100 tons annually. The NSR process requires preconstruction permits for new sources potentially emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant. Sources subject to PSD must install BACT, while non-attainment sources must install LAER and obtain offsets. Few permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants. The current U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity has remained steady at 300,000 MW for the last ten years. Emissions trends show a drop in SO2 emissions in 1995 due to the acid rain control program. Phase 1 units reduced SO2 emissions from 10 million tons in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995. The acid rain control program reduced SO2 emissions from coal-fired plants by 4.7 million tons by 1995, but overall emissions only decreased by 3.6 million tons. Similarly, NOx emissions were reduced by 0.4 million tons, but overall reduction was only 0.1 million tons by 1996. Despite a lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have continued to increase over the past decade. Coal consumption has increased over the past decade as utilities have optimized performance of aging coal-fired facilities. Contrary to expectations, utilization of coal-fired capacity has risen without a decrease in efficiency. This suggests a shift in plant maintenance economics, prompting questions in EPA lawsuits about whether maintenance constitutes \"routine maintenance\" or a \"major modification\" under the CAA. The restructuring of the electric utility industry has led to a focus on plant economics, causing issues with the term \"life extension\" for old power plants due to the Clean Air Act regulations. Regulatory activities are ongoing regarding electricity generation and air quality, including the Ozone Transport Rule. Regulatory activities related to air quality include the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates and revised Ozone NAAQS, and NSPS for NOx for electric utilities. NSR enforcement is a primary tool for enforcing existing laws, separate from regulatory development, with the Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits targeting coal-fired utilities since 1996. EPA can seek court-imposed remedial actions and penalties for affected utilities. EPA can enforce NSR violations by requiring affected sources to install the latest pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization units for SO2 and selective catalytic reduction units for NOx. These controls could reduce emissions by 70-90%, leading to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions. Administrator Browner stated that controlling emissions from powerplants could result in an 85 to 95 percent reduction in pollutants, equivalent to taking 26 million cars off the road. The focus on NSR reflects the belief that continuing operation of aging coal-fired plants is a future trend under electric utility restructuring. Extending the life of existing coal-fired capacity is cost-effective and competitive in a restructured industry. The trend towards renovating existing coal-fired capacity has been increasing for almost two decades, with potential emissions impacts recognized early on. EPA is taking legal actions against utilities for maintenance activities it has implicitly approved for years. In October 1988, EPA made efforts to enforce NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities, facing challenges due to budget constraints and defining major modifications. The CAA defined modification as any physical or operational change increasing air pollutant emissions. EPA regulations specified that any replacement exceeding 50% of building costs placed the plant under NSPS. The EPA regulations in 1977 shifted focus from NSPS to NAAQS and PSD, defining \"significant\" emission increases as exceeding 40 tons per year for major sources of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Enforcing these thresholds for NSR has proven challenging, as they are more sensitive triggers than NSPS for life extension efforts in utilities. Life extension mainly improves availability and reliability, not capacity to generate, and typically costs less than the 50% asset value threshold. In the late 1980s, EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension efforts, including Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO). The new \"test\" compares a facility's actual emissions before modification with projected actual emissions after modification to determine NSR applicability. The current NSR regulations for utility plants define modifications as changes that go beyond routine maintenance, repair, or replacement. Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to align with routine maintenance schedules, using terms like capital improvement and rehabilitation program instead of \"life extension.\" This approach helps integrate these efforts into facility operation and maintenance without triggering NSR requirements. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce the Clean Air Act's New Source Review requirements regarding new construction and modifications of coal-fired capacity by utilities. EPA has issued Compliance Orders for modifications by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Tables identify facilities cited for violating NSR requirements. EPA views certain rehabilitations as triggering the modification criterion for NSR. The Justice Department/EPA complaints may be modified and additional complaints issued as investigations proceed. Complaints seek injunctive relief and civil penalties up to $25,000 per day of violation. Relief includes compliance with CAA requirements, installing BACT for past NSR violations, applying for permits, and auditing operations for compliance. TVA's compliance order requires developing a schedule for meeting requirements, auditing coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retiring SO2 allowances for reductions. Industry focuses on NSR exemption for \"routine maintenance.\" Industry argues that EPA is changing the rules by citing routine maintenance activities as triggering NSR violations. They claim these activities are necessary for plant operation and should not be considered major modifications. Emissions must not exceed the cap, but if NSR is applied to capped sources, pollution will be shifted to other sources. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from certain plants could lead to significant reductions in pollutants. This could result in a reduction of 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. Despite the potential for substantial emission reductions through NSR actions, the complexity of the Clean Air Act may impact the actual outcomes. The Clean Air Act's title IV limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons starting in 2000, with interim reductions required in 1995. Emissions are capped at a specified rate based on historical data, and an allowance system was created for compliance, resulting in 100% success. The 1990 CAA Amendments program has been successful with 100% compliance. It does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program, as they have little in common except for focusing on existing facilities and SO2. NSR deals with modifications and BACT installation, while Title IV focuses on reducing aggregate SO2 emissions with flexibility for compliance strategies. NSR requires individual plant standards compliance, while Title IV allows for excess allowances from installing BACT, leading to potential sales. The interaction between NSR enforcement and Title IV could result in excess SO2 allowances available for sale or banking, potentially nullifying reductions achieved through NSR. Title IV does not adjust allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement, leading to a potential \"allowance trap\" unless Congress changes the law or utilities voluntarily surrender excess allowances. The situation with potential NOx reduction is complex due to the interaction of NSR and the NOx NSPS, which historically has not reflected cutting-edge technology. In 1998, the NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities was set at 0.6/0.5 lb. of NOx per million Btu, depending on the type of coal burned. A new standard of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu was introduced in 1998 but was challenged in court. The D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the new standard for modified utility boilers in September 1999, reverting back to the 1979 standard until a revised NSPS is proposed. This uncertainty affects the determination of BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The 1998 NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities set a new standard of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, which was challenged in court. The D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the new standard in 1999, reverting back to the 1979 standard until a revised NSPS is proposed. This uncertainty impacts the determination of BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The interaction of NSR and title IV further complicates matters, with the title IV NOx program differing substantially from the SO2 program. Existing coal-fired facilities may have emission controls more stringent than the existing NSPS due to the title IV program. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, but the effectiveness of this action is questioned. NSR was introduced in 1977 to control emissions, but more efficient methods have been developed since then. Title IV of the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1990, has been more successful in reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants. Title IV of the Clean Air Act has been more successful in reducing SO2 emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities compared to NSR. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV has had 100% compliance, while NSR enforcement has been questioned for its effectiveness. One alternative is to lower the cap on emissions contained in title IV to further reduce SO2 emissions from power plants. Lowering the existing cap by about two-thirds could achieve similar emission reductions as all existing power plants meeting the 1978 NSPS. The EPA is considering a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx emissions to address uncertainties in NSR enforcement. This program could provide utilities with flexibility in achieving emission reductions and potentially streamline compliance with EPA initiatives. However, implementing such a program would require new legislation and regional cooperation. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade program as part of its compliance plans for reducing NOx emissions. The EPA is considering a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx emissions to address uncertainties in NSR enforcement. This program would require regional cooperation and potentially streamline compliance with EPA initiatives. Additionally, there are other regulatory initiatives underway at EPA to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions, such as the OTR and Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. These initiatives do not require further legislative authority but have long implementation schedules. Another alternative to NSR is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide, which could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. The EPA is considering reforms to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide, which could reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. CO2 is not currently considered an air pollutant under the CAA, and regulating Hg emissions from electric utility boilers has been slow. EPA's authority to regulate CO2 is controversial, and alternatives include voluntary initiatives, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, or reforming NSR through new legislation or EPA initiatives. The EPA has been considering reforms to NSR for years, including proposed \"off-ramps\" like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. However, the effectiveness of these alternatives is debatable, as they require time and may need legislation or finalization of regulations. EPA is also looking into cap and trade programs for various pollutants. The EPA is considering cap and trade programs for pollutants and the replacement of NSR with a cap for environmental protection at lower cost. The debate on NSR often focuses on \"grandfathered\" powerplants, which emit more pollution due to exemptions for older plants. \"Grandfathered\" is a term used to indicate if a powerplant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, which sets regulations for new sources. These regulations require new sources to install emission reduction systems. Powerplants that were built before the NSPS regulations are usually considered \"grandfathered\" and are not subject to them. The term \"grandfathered\" in relation to powerplants under the Clean Air Act's Section 111 regulations is ambiguous and potentially meaningless due to various factors. Some pollutants like CO2 and mercury are not covered by NSPS, making all powerplants grandfathered for these emissions. The NSPS is reviewed every eight years, leading to increased stringency for covered pollutants. The definition of \"grandfathered\" is unclear as there is no fixed baseline, with different pollutants having different standards. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing powerplants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments imposed more stringent requirements on existing powerplants for SO2 and NOx emissions compared to previous NSPS standards. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in this context, as age of the plant is not relevant for NOx emissions, but rather the fuel source. For SO2 emissions, the focus is on the emissions cap set by title IV, with age being a factor in allocating emission credits. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is effectively nil as all new sources must offset their emissions. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is a logical approach to reducing emissions from electric generating facilities. EPA favors a cap on NOx emissions as well, with state-by-state emissions caps proposed. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the DOJ/EPA actions on NSR. Interpretations of CAA provisions and potential new legislation are key issues in addressing NSR problems. New legislation amending the Clean Air Act (CAA) is needed to address NSR issues and update regulations for the electric utility industry based on 30 years of CAA implementation."
