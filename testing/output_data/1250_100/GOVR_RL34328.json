It includes provisions for research funding, early career grants, ARPA-E, and Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for research funding, early career grants, and Innovation Institutes. It includes STEM education initiatives such as training programs for K-12 teachers, student-focused programs, scholarships, and new educational activities at DOE, ED, and NSF. White House efforts under OSTP are also included to foster innovation. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for research funding, early career grants, and Innovation Institutes. It includes White House efforts under OSTP to foster innovation and competitiveness activities. To maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy, U.S. companies must engage in trade, retain market shares, and offer high-quality products and services. Scientific and technological advances contribute to the creation of new goods, services, jobs, and capital, enhancing productivity and offsetting disadvantages in cost. Various factors influence technological progress, and two policy approaches have been used to address U.S. competitiveness. Since World War II, the United States has used a combination of direct and indirect approaches to enhance current and future U.S. competitiveness. Concerns about U.S. competitiveness were expressed in the Steelman report following the war, with experts in the 1970s worried about competition from Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries. The United States had lost market share in various industries, leading to concerns about declining technological superiority. The United States faced challenges in competitiveness post-World War II, with concerns about declining technological superiority. This led to a decline in productivity growth, narrowing gap in scientists and engineers, and lower patent grants. Congress responded by passing various acts to address the issue, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act and the Bayh-Dole Act. Additionally, the SEMATECH consortium was established to enhance semiconductor manufacturing technology. In response to competitiveness concerns, Congress passed acts like the Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to increase corporate spending on research and development. The Small Business Development Act set aside federal R&D funds for innovative small firms. By the mid-1990s, the US economy and technological innovation improved, with actions taken by manufacturers, universities, and national laboratories. The US excelled in industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, while Japan's economy declined. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on different issues as the nation enters the 21st century. Today's competitiveness concerns in the 21st century are centered around globalization, federal funding for science and engineering research, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees. The impact of globalization on American companies, workers, and families is both positive and negative, with increased productivity leading to higher living standards, but also concerns about job loss and lower wages as companies compete in a global economy. The America COMPETES Act addresses globalization concerns by focusing on technology, labor supply, and government policies to enhance competitiveness in the global economy. It includes measures to increase federal funding for basic research in science and engineering to stimulate technological progress and create new industries and jobs. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance competitiveness by increasing federal funding for research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. It also focuses on improving the U.S. labor pool's competitiveness and increasing the number of STEM teachers and students pursuing advanced degrees. Additionally, the act addresses government trade and investment policies. The America COMPETES Act authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify actions for the United States to enhance competitiveness. It includes studying costs for U.S. businesses in innovation compared to foreign competitors. Some experts support actions to improve U.S. competitiveness, while others doubt the effectiveness of the proposed actions in the Act. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness through various measures. The focus is on trade balance in high technology products, with the U.S. running a deficit from 2002 to 2005, peaking at $43.6 billion. The deficit dropped to $38.1 billion in 2006 but resumed growing in 2007. The deficit in high technology products grew to $52.6 billion in 2007, but only reached $55.5 billion in 2008. This deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the technology race as many imports are from U.S. companies. However, the growing deficit may require closer policy scrutiny. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. declined after 2000 but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete in export markets. The United States is a major recipient of foreign direct investments, with concerns about displaced workers and lower wages. Most investments are in high-income developed countries, leading to a restructuring of U.S. investments abroad. Most economists believe that direct investment abroad is a result of U.S. manufacturing industry restructuring and does not decrease jobs or incomes for Americans. NSF struggles to accurately determine the science and engineering workforce, as their classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in various occupations. This includes those in science- and engineering-related jobs who may not have formal degrees in the field, such as patent attorneys or physicians. The need for science and engineering knowledge has increased for various occupations, leading to a larger workforce than traditionally accounted for. The National Science Board suggests that in 2006, the science and engineering workforce varied between 5.0 million and 21.4 million individuals, with the most relevant number being 17.0 million individuals with degrees in science and engineering fields. This reflects the diverse ways science and technical knowledge is utilized in the United States. The analysis shows how computerization has changed the skills needed for employment, shifting towards high-level tasks and reducing the need for routine manual and cognitive tasks. This has led to an increased demand for workers with a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge. The U.S. Census Bureau's analysis of science and engineering workforce trends shows significant growth in STEM occupations, outpacing the total labor force. Recent data from BLS indicates a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the workforce since 2000, but projects a 21.4% growth in science and engineering occupations from 2004 to 2014, with computer-related occupations expected to drive most of this growth. The demand for science and engineering-related occupations, including post-secondary teachers, healthcare practitioners, and science managers, is projected to grow. Unemployment in these fields was 1.6% in 2006. STEM workers have higher compensation compared to the U.S. labor force, with salaries ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per annum. Recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients saw a 15% increase in real salary from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree were $65,000, higher than non-S&E bachelor's degree recipients. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness in STEM occupations. Factors such as foreign affiliate sales, global supply chains, and intangibles like knowledge and intellectual property are not considered. They suggest that assessing a nation's trade balance is not as useful anymore, as value is now created through intangible assets in global networks. For individuals, additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be considered. The America COMPETES Act is based on the assumption that STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. It highlights the need for more STEM proficiency in K-12 students and the importance of encouraging individuals to pursue STEM fields to maintain a competitive workforce. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of STEM education for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering. It stresses the need for increased STEM proficiency in K-12 students to maintain a competitive workforce. Additionally, federal funding for basic science and engineering research is crucial for U.S. competitiveness, as it can lead to the creation of new industries and jobs. The United States has lower scores in mathematics literacy compared to the OECD average, with deficiencies in teacher preparation and curriculum contributing to this issue. Additionally, the U.S. has a low rate of first university degrees awarded in STEM fields, and investment in research and development has shown to positively impact economic growth. Some question the assumptions behind U.S. investments in federal research programs and STEM education, wondering if the benefits are exclusive to the U.S. or if other countries can benefit as well. They also question the effectiveness of federal government influence in STEM education and research, and whether these investments will create jobs for all Americans. Additionally, there are doubts about whether actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness are necessary, as other factors beyond STEM research and education also contribute to competitiveness. Some analysts question the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness, doubting the need for additional scientists and engineers and the effectiveness of increasing funding. Concerns also arise about potential oversupply of STEM professionals and the management of increased research funding. Policymakers propose both direct and indirect measures, focusing on direct funding while studying possible indirect approaches. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address, responding to concerns about insufficient investment in science and technology research. Proponents of direct government assistance argue for focusing on technologies with the greatest promise, while those favoring indirect measures support policies that enhance the market's ability to make investment decisions. The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) was introduced in response to concerns about insufficient investment in science and technology research. It included provisions for increased funding in research at NSF, NIST laboratories, and the DOE Office of Science. The America COMPETES Act, which incorporated many ACI provisions, also authorized funding increases for STEM education programs and new research organizations like ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. Additionally, the act encouraged executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their basic research budget to fund high-risk, high-reward projects and emphasized the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels for U.S. innovation. The America COMPETES Act of 2005 authorizes funding increases for NSF, NIST laboratories, and the DOE Office of Science over FY2008-2010, with potential doubling of funding over seven years. Advocates call for increased research funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science based on the National Academies' report. This report recommends a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research to support high-potential high-risk projects and address stagnant funding in key fields. The National Academies recommend a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research to address stagnant funding in key fields. The committee believes this growth rate strikes an appropriate balance between urgency and efficiency in applying new funds. The National Academies recommend a doubling of funding for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over 10 years to address stagnant funding in key fields and enhance the nation's long-term economic competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act proposes doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. It emphasizes NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through research, development, and STEM education. The Act also highlights the importance of robust funding for NASA to support U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The Senate and House appropriations committees express concerns about the President's FY2008 budget not adequately balancing funding for NASA's initiatives. The National Research Council report recommends that NASA's tasks should align with its resources. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes high-risk, high reward projects for executive research agencies. This provision aims to address concerns about funding review mechanisms not being open to new ideas. The National Science Board found that transformative research faces challenges in traditional review systems and limited budgets, leading to reluctance in submitting radical ideas to funding agencies like NSF. The National Institutes of Health has introduced the Pioneer's Award to support high-risk research. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, defines transformative research as revolutionary and cutting-edge, emphasizing the need for fostering such research at NSF. The National Science Board's report highlights the lack of dedicated funds for transformative research at the National Science Foundation. The Appropriations Committees have directed the Foundation to review current practices and provide a report on addressing this issue. The House Committee on Appropriations suggests allocating $10 million for a new program focusing on transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E to develop technologies that enhance economic and energy security in the U.S. The ARPA-E program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and advance energy technologies in the United States. Modeled after DARPA, it focuses on promoting revolutionary advances in science and technology that industry may not pursue due to uncertainty. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past to bridge the gap between scientific discoveries and practical applications. In the 100th and 101st Congresses, proposals were made for a civilian technology agency. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report suggested a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies and fuels. The objectives of ARPA-E, as indicated by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, include bringing excitement to energy research, focusing on transformational research, and utilizing a flat and nimble organization structure. The National Academies proposed creating an ARPA-like organization for energy research with initial funding of $300 million, increasing to $1 billion per year. The organization should bridge gaps between research, development, and innovation, with a flat and nimble structure. Funding for ARPA-E should not jeopardize basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. Details of ARPA-E's organization and mission should be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Undersecretary. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations. The institutes, along with their partners, would support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness, train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, and collaborate with industry partners. The America COMPETES Act authorizes STEM education programs to train engineers in areas like nanoscience and microsystems, reshaping engineering research and education to address global challenges. This requires collaboration between DOE National Laboratories, universities, industry, and other sectors of society. The America COMPETES Act includes STEM education programs such as grants for specialty high schools, internships at national labs, centers of excellence in STEM education, summer institutes for teachers, and a graduate research fellowship program. The Act emphasizes outreach, mentoring for women and minorities, and inclusion of students from high-need schools. The Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) fellowship program for outstanding graduate students in DOE fields emphasizes imagination, creativity, and communication skills. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow grant programs aim to enhance STEM education through partnerships and teacher training programs. Math Now improves math instruction for elementary and middle school students, while the AP/IB Program expands access to advanced coursework for low-income students. Increased support for AP/IB coursework in math, science, and critical foreign languages in high-need schools, including training more high school teachers. Additional support for existing NSF programs such as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, STEM talent expansion program (STEP), Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF), and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program. These initiatives aim to improve STEM education and increase the number of students pursuing STEM degrees. The America COMPETES Act programs managed by the DOE and its National Laboratories are under discussion in Congress. The Administration opposes some DOE-Managed STEM initiatives, but proponents argue that interacting with DOE scientists can inspire K-12 students to learn math and science. Specialty schools for math and science are proposed to improve academic achievement in these subjects. The Administration opposes DOE responsibility for establishing or expanding K-12 schools, advocating for improving existing efforts before starting new programs. Proponents argue that specialty schools in math and science can be a \"nucleus of excellence\" that attracts the best students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education aim to assist teachers in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes DOE involvement in establishing school-based centers in high-need public secondary schools, believing it would divert resources from national laboratories. Proponents argue that such programs benefit teachers and students. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes STEM education programs at NSF and introduces a new program. The Administration opposes increased funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and the establishment of the Laboratory Science Pilot program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes NSF's role in promoting quality math and science education nationwide. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program aims to recruit and prepare STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers. It provides grants to institutions for scholarships and stipends in exchange for teaching in high-need schools. The program is crucial for creating a new generation of innovators and enhancing the education of future science and engineering workforce. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program offers grants for STEM students to become math and science teachers in high-need schools. The program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach, aiming to better prepare teachers for the classroom. Universities involved have had to shift their focus from research to education careers for their students. The NSF authorizes a new program to fund institutions of higher education in creating or improving professional science master's degree programs focused on practical training for high-need fields. PSM programs aim to meet industry workforce needs by combining advanced science training with workplace skills valued by employers. These programs typically include academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications. The America COMPETES Act authorizes grants to improve school laboratories and STEM instruction quality. It includes professional development for teachers, equipment purchase, and hands-on laboratory experiences. A National Research Council report highlights poor lab quality for most students, especially in schools with non-Asian minorities and poor students. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program aims to increase STEM teachers with proper training. The Math Now program aims to increase the number of STEM teachers with training in STEM fields by offering bachelor's and master's degree programs. It focuses on improving math instruction for elementary and middle school students through research-based tools and professional development. The America COMPETES Act includes provisions for establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act established the National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush convened a National Science and Technology Summit in 2008 to assess U.S. science and technology enterprises. The Act directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to align R&D budget priorities with summit recommendations and develop principles for data exchange among federal scientists. The Bush Administration OSTP issued a memorandum to federal research agencies in response to this directive. The Federal government emphasizes scientific openness for sharing information with the public and policymakers. NASA's communication policy serves as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak to the press and public about their work. The America COMPETES Act outlines actions for the OSTP, including studying barriers to innovation and coordinating national research efforts. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on the Nomination of Dr. John Holdren as OSTP Director. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress. Dr. Holdren emphasized the need for scientific integrity in federal agencies, ensuring open communication of data and preventing censorship or distortion of research findings. President Obama issued a memorandum assigning OSTP the responsibility for maintaining the highest level of scientific integrity. The Director of OSTP is tasked with ensuring scientific integrity in the executive branch, including candidate selection based on knowledge and experience, agency procedures for scientific integrity, and accurate reflection of scientific information in policy decisions. Each agency should ensure the integrity of scientific and technological information used in policy decisions, establish procedures to address compromised information, and provide necessary information to the Director of OSTP for recommendations to the President. Coordination with the Director is required for interim procedures to maintain scientific decision-making integrity. The FY2008 and FY2009 appropriation and FY2010 authorization for America COMPETES Act programs are summarized in Table 2. Funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act led to funding of some programs at authorized levels. ARPA-E received $415.0 million in FY2009, raising questions about future funding levels. The FY2008 and FY2009 appropriation and FY2010 authorization for America COMPETES Act programs are summarized in Table 2. Funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act led to funding of some programs at authorized levels. However, there are challenges in determining the status of certain programs due to discrepancies between budget proposals and the America COMPETES Act. Insufficient evidence exists to confirm funding for new America COMPETES Act programs such as DOE Pilot Program of Grants to Specialty Schools and Early Career Awards for Researchers. The America COMPETES Act programs face funding challenges as Congress deliberates FY2010 appropriations. The Obama Administration requested funding below authorized levels, citing FY2009 ARRA funding as a reason for high federal R&D program levels. Some newly authorized programs have not received funding proposals. Authorization levels are set only through FY2010. The America COMPETES Act aims to invest in innovation and improve US competitiveness. Evaluating its success is challenging due to various influencing factors. The goal is to maintain the US's top ranking in international competitiveness despite increasing investments by other countries. Evaluation mechanisms within the act and longitudinal analysis by international organizations help assess the nation's progress. The evaluation mechanisms within the America COMPETES Act and longitudinal analysis by international organizations assess the nation's competitiveness. There are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness, and various indicators play a role in the innovation process. Inputs like increased spending for research and development may not always lead to new technologies. Increased spending for research and development may not always lead to innovative technologies, as innovation can also occur due to market demand or minor alterations in existing products. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all play a major role in funding R&D and innovation, with a focus on basic research in the America COMPETES Act. University-industry cooperation serves as a liaison between basic research and industry for technological advancement. R&D funding for defense-related research differs among countries. Analyzing non-defense R&D and industry R&D investment patterns is crucial. Patent data may not fully capture innovation, as not all outcomes are patentable. The number of scientists and engineers may not solely determine a nation's innovative capacity. Government policy focuses on fostering innovation and competitiveness. The government policy focuses on creating an environment for innovation to flourish, aiming for competitiveness with other nations. Monitoring and assessments are crucial for adjusting policies as other countries also enhance their innovation environments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a key role in monitoring and advising on global trends, opportunities, and metrics for measuring progress. The federal government is implementing recommendations to improve innovation conditions through talent development, investment, and infrastructure. Evaluation of research and education programs, such as ARPA-E and Discovery Science Institutes, is conducted to assess their effectiveness. Agencies use a merit-based process to fund research activities and education programs like DOE summer institutes are required to report on improving STEM teaching skills. The ED STEM programs aim to increase the number of STEM teachers in schools, especially those in need, and to bring more underrepresented groups into STEM teaching. Annual evaluations are conducted to assess the impact on student achievement, with reports submitted to relevant committees. Monitoring mechanisms are in place to evaluate U.S. competitiveness. The evaluation of U.S. competitiveness includes indicators like the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard, which provide information on innovation, trade competitiveness, and productivity. Output indicators such as economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages are used to assess competitiveness. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Census Bureau, and National Science Foundation monitor output indicators regularly. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report that tracks the health of the science and engineering enterprise. Input indicators like quality of education, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are also monitored. These indicators help identify policy areas for the U.S. to focus on relative to its competitors. The U.S. ranks number one overall in the WEF competitiveness analysis but not on all input/output indicators. Key sub-indicators related to the America COMPETES Act programs and U.S. ranking are monitored. Some key sub-indicators related to the America COMPETES Act programs and the U.S. ranking in each out of 131 countries are: quality of primary education (28th), quality of math and science education in higher education (45th), capacity for innovation (9th), quality of scientific research institutions (2nd), and availability of scientists and engineers (12th). Various organizations use unique indicators to analyze state-level competitiveness, such as human capital investment, research and development inputs, risk capital, technology workforce, and technology concentration. The America COMPETES Act focuses on funding for academic R&D, STEM education, and public education. The act established new programs and authorized increases in appropriations for existing programs. However, not all programs received funding at authorized levels in FY2009. Congress is deliberating on the FY2010 budget for America COMPETES Act programs. The America COMPETES Act focuses on funding for academic R&D, STEM education, and public education. Congress is deliberating on providing appropriations for newly authorized programs in the act. Some policymakers are assessing the impact of funding decisions on U.S. competitiveness and the role in the global economy. The America COMPETES Act was passed by the Senate and House in 2007, incorporating several House bills. It focused on funding for academic R&D, STEM education, and public education. The President signed the bill into law on August 9, 2007. In the 109th and 110th Congress, various bills were introduced to address issues related to STEM education and research funding. These bills included the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and the National Competitiveness Investment Act. Senators and House Committees were actively involved in sponsoring and supporting these bills. In the 110th Congress, S. 761 was introduced based on previous bills from the 109th Congress, including the Protecting America's Competitive Edge Through Energy Act and the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act. These bills were largely influenced by the recommendations of the National Academies report Rising Above the Gathering Storm, also known as the \"Gathering Storm Report.\" The America COMPETES Act (S. 2802 /Ensign) was a response to reports like Innovate America and the Gathering Storm report. It directs the President to convene a National Science and Technology Summit and issue a report on the results. The Act also requires the budget to include R&D priorities related to the Summit's conclusions and recommendations. Additionally, it mandates a study by the National Academy of Sciences on science and technology policy. The America COMPETES Act directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study new forms of risk for businesses and report results to Congress. It also renames the National Technology Medal and encourages STEM Days in schools. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of understanding and strategically responding to service science. The America COMPETES Act directs the OSTP Director to study ways the federal government could support service science. It also establishes a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to promote innovation and competitiveness, with the NAS providing a list of recommended advisors. Additionally, the Director of OSTP is required to identify deficiencies in research facilities and coordinate planning for their improvement. The America COMPETES Act requires annual reports to Congress on deficiencies in research infrastructure and budget proposals for federal research facilities. It also emphasizes the importance of supporting innovation through high-risk, high-reward basic research projects and mandates the communication of research results to agencies, policymakers, and the public. Title II of the America COMPETES Act focuses on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), requiring NASA to participate in interagency efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and education. The Act mandates annual reports on NASA's promotional activities and effectiveness assessments of its education programs. NASA is also required to coordinate its aeronautics activities accordingly. The America COMPETES Act mandates NASA to coordinate aeronautics activities with other government departments, including the Joint Planning and Development Office. It also requires coordination of basic research activities with other agencies and addresses aging workforce issues in aerospace. The America COMPETES Act mandates NASA to coordinate aeronautics activities with other government departments and requires the NASA Administrator to support basic research projects primarily conducted by undergraduate students. Additionally, the Administrator must develop education projects utilizing resources from the International Space Station and identify research opportunities to enhance U.S. competitiveness in science, technology, and engineering. The Act also authorizes appropriations to the National Institute of Standards and Technology for scientific research and services. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to various acts related to scientific research and services, construction and maintenance of facilities, and Industrial Technology Services activities.
