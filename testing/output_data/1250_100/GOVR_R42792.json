    "content": "Foster care is a temporary living arrangement for children who cannot safely remain in their own homes. The child welfare agency's goal is to provide necessary services for the child to return to their parents. If reunification is not possible, the agency works to find a permanent home through adoption or legal guardianship. The responsibility for child protection is primarily a state duty, but Congress supports states in improving child welfare services through federal funding. States meeting federal requirements can claim partial reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The Title IV-E program provides federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. States spent $12.4 billion in FY2011, receiving $6.7 billion in federal reimbursement. The program is administered by the Children's Bureau at the federal level and by state child welfare agencies at the state level. The state child welfare agency oversees the administration of the Title IV-E program, ensuring compliance with federal policy. Most of the funding is used for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. The report discusses how children enter foster care, the requirements for states to receive federal funds, and eligibility criteria for the program's components. The child welfare program consists of three components: foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Public child protection agencies conduct family investigations to address child abuse or neglect concerns, with neglect being the most common issue. Investigative caseworkers often find that children can safely remain at home. After investigations, 87.1% of children were living at home, 6.1% in informal kinship arrangements, and 6.3% in formal out-of-home placements. Risk factors for child abuse/neglect include high stress, low social support, substance abuse, domestic violence history, and mental health issues. These factors are more common in families where children are removed from the home. Children removed from the home following investigations are more likely to have risk factors compared to those who remain at home. Foster care is a temporary solution with the goal of reuniting children with their parents. This poses challenges for child welfare agencies. Child welfare agencies face challenges in meeting the goal of reuniting children with their parents. Title IV-E funds are used for required case planning for children in foster care, but can only be used for children who meet eligibility criteria. States rely on various federal funding streams to support child welfare goals. Title IV-E funds ongoing adoption and kinship guardianship assistance to find safe and permanent homes for children in foster care. States provide financial assistance to eligible children after they leave foster care for adoption or guardianship. Post-adoption and post-guardianship support services are not covered by Title IV-E funds, but can be supported by other child welfare programs. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides support for youth aging out of foster care, separate from Title IV-E funding. Title IV-E is a joint federal-state program that reimburses states for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children. The Title IV-E program provides federal funding for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children. Indian tribes can also access this funding by meeting program requirements. Only one tribe had completed the process of developing a tribal Title IV-E program as of September 2012, but more tribes are working towards approval. The program was established in 1980 under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. The Title IV-E program, established in 1980, provides federal funding for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance. Various acts have amended the program, such as the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 and the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, which focused on children's safety, achieving permanency, and well-being in foster care. The program encompasses three separate programs with specific eligibility requirements and assistance types. The Title IV-E program requires states to have a federally approved plan to receive federal funding for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance. The plan must include provisions for foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance agreements, and kinship guardianship assistance agreements. States must also perform administrative tasks to ensure the safety, permanence, and well-being of children in foster care. The Title IV-E plan requirements are crucial for children in foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship programs. States must meet these requirements to receive federal funding, which defines eligible costs and allowable spending. Eligible costs include direct financial assistance and program administration, with any other costs considered administrative. The Title IV-E program covers a wide range of administrative activities to support children in foster care, including case planning, court proceedings, and finding suitable homes. States must report separate spending on program training and other administrative costs. Title IV-E program funds must be used for eligible costs and children, with specific criteria for federal reimbursement. Eligibility is based on age, citizenship, and background checks for foster or adoptive parents. Assistance is typically for children from low-income households who have been removed from their homes. Federal reimbursement varies for different program costs, such as foster care maintenance and adoption assistance. The federal reimbursement for Title IV-E program costs, including foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments, is determined by each state's unique FMAP. The FMAP ranges from 50% to 83% and is calculated annually by HHS. States with higher per capita income receive lower federal reimbursement rates. Administrative costs are reimbursed at 50%, SACWIS costs at 50%, and training costs at 75%. All states receive the same federal reimbursement rates for additional program costs. The federal reimbursement for Title IV-E program costs, including foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments, is determined by each state's unique FMAP. Congress enacted temporary increases in federal share of Title IV-E payments from October 1, 2008 through June 30, 2011, as part of state fiscal relief during the Great Recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act raised each state's FMAP by 6.2 percentage points from 2008 to 2010, with subsequent extensions at lower levels in 2011. Federal participation in the program returned to regular rates after June 30, 2011. As of August 30, 2012, the federal government had obligated $968 million to states under the Title IV-E program due to enhanced FMAP. States can still make adjustments to their Title IV-E claims for the period of enhanced funding from October 1, 2008, to June 30, 2011. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E program costs is authorized on a permanent and open-ended basis, with no limit on annual funding. Congress appropriates funds based on HHS estimates for eligible program costs submitted by states. The IV-E program cost submitted by states is estimated in the Administration's annual budget request based on anticipated state spending. If the estimate exceeds actual funds needed, the excess lapses back to the federal treasury. Additional funds are made available if the estimate falls short. Funding to states under Title IV-E is not limited by a dollar amount but by the state's spending under the program. Federal reimbursement is provided only after the state has spent its own funds on eligible assistance or activities. Title IV-E funding is limited by statutory and regulatory definitions, only available for specific program costs for eligible children. Funds cannot be used for social services or other activities not included in the plan. The focus is on eligibility criteria and funding provided under each program component. The focus of Title IV-E funding is on eligibility criteria and funding provided under each program component, including foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Foster care is a temporary living arrangement for children's safety and well-being, with the goal of returning them to their own home if possible. If not, the agency must find a new permanent home through adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a relative. The number of children entering foster care annually has decreased to around 250,000 from a peak of 300,000 in the mid-2000s. The total number of children in foster care has declined since FY1999, standing at fewer than 401,000 as of FY2011. The decrease is due to more children leaving foster care for adoption or guardianship and fewer children entering care. Less than half of children in foster care receive federally supported foster care maintenance payments under Title IV-E, with eligibility criteria varying by state. Children not meeting Title IV-E criteria require state or other funding for support. Federal Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria are multifaceted, emphasizing the importance of judicial approval for removal from parents' homes, ensuring children's safety, and establishing a permanent home through reunification, adoption, or legal guardianship. States can now extend assistance to youth beyond age 18 if permanent family placement is not achieved, based on research showing better outcomes for older youth in foster care. Eligibility is limited to children from very low-income, primarily single-parent households. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 amended the Title IV-E program to allow states to provide assistance to youth in foster care beyond their 18th birthday. Eligibility criteria include being in school, working, engaged in activities to promote employment, or having a documented medical condition. 16 states had approval to extend Title IV-E foster care to eligible youth beyond age 18 as of October 2012. HHS has informed states that they may choose to permit eligibility for youth who meet certain criteria, such as being in school, working, or having a medical condition. Most states plan to provide foster care assistance to eligible youth based on federal law criteria. Federal funding for foster care originated in 1961 as part of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, with eligibility criteria linked to income standards. Despite the establishment of independent funding for foster care in 1980, eligibility rules remain tied to the previous program. The federal foster care program, established in 1980, repealed the AFDC program in 1996. States submitted $8.327 billion in Title IV-E foster care expenses in FY2011, receiving federal reimbursement of $4.340 billion. Maintenance payments accounted for 29% of spending, while general foster care administrative purposes represented 46%. A portion of spending supported SACWIS and foster care training. 19% of spending was reported under \"demonstrations\" category. Overall spending under the Title IV-E foster care program has been decreasing since FY2002, with a significant decline in foster care maintenance payments starting in FY1999. The number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments also decreased by nearly 45% from FY1998 to FY2011. Total spending on general foster care administrative costs surpassed spending on maintenance payments in FY2000. Foster care administrative spending continued to increase for a few years before trending down since the mid-2000s. Title IV-E foster care spending has fluctuated over the years, with claims for SACWIS development peaking in the late 1990s. Despite expanded authority, spending for foster care training has not increased. Spending under child welfare demonstration projects saw a significant increase in FY2007 and FY2008, with most of the spending in FY2011 related to projects in Florida and California. Waiver projects must be cost neutral to the federal government. Title IV-E funding under demonstration projects allows for broader spending on services and activities, supporting individuals not typically eligible for assistance. Federal support covers 50%-83% of foster care maintenance costs based on state FMAP. Total spending by federal and state shares from FY1997-FY2011 is shown in Figure 2. States set foster care maintenance payment rates based on the child's age, placement setting, and special needs. In 2008-2009, the average monthly payment for children in non-relative foster homes was $679. Rates vary for children in kinship or institutional settings. States also provide support for items like clothing and child care to foster caregivers. In 2008-2009, foster care maintenance payments covered basic living expenses for most non-relative caregivers, but many supplemented with their own funds. Non-relative caregivers generally had higher household income than relative caregivers. The federal government typically covers 54-55% of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments. During FY2010, the federal share of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments peaked at nearly 63%, with states receiving $463 million in additional federal support under the ARRA provision. Children in foster care who are not Title IV-E eligible require state and local funds for full maintenance payment costs. States can utilize other federal funding streams, such as TANF, to assist non-eligible children in foster care. A TANF \"child-only\" payment can be given to a child in foster care living with a relative, regardless of the relative's income. States may also use TANF for foster care maintenance payments for other children in foster care. States often use TANF funds for child welfare purposes, including monthly assistance and other services. Other federal funding sources like SSI and Social Security benefits are sometimes used for room and board payments for children in foster care. States may use TANF for foster care maintenance payments for children in foster care. Medicaid can also supplement payments for children with special medical needs. The use of Medicaid for child welfare purposes has declined in recent years. The federal foster care coverage rate has fluctuated over the years, estimated to be around 40% in FY2011. The federal foster care coverage rate varied among states from 2000 to 2010, with a decline from 68% to 55%. Discrepancies between administrative and survey data may be due to differences in counting methods. Both sources show wide state variation in coverage rates. The federal foster care coverage rate has declined over the past decade. Eligibility for Title IV-E foster care support is determined by the income criteria of the prior law AFDC program, with state need standards varying significantly and generally being quite low. The federal Title IV-E foster care assistance eligibility is based on income criteria from the prior AFDC program, with state standards varying and generally being low. The decline in coverage is attributed to the income test not being adjusted for inflation, although other eligibility criteria also play a role. The relationship between a state's AFDC income test and its coverage rate is not always straightforward due to multiple eligibility criteria. Almost no research has been done on the reasons states find children ineligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments. In a survey by Child Trends, parent's income was a common cause for ineligibility in 26 states, but it varied widely in significance. Other factors included lack of required judicial determinations, unlicensed homes, and ineligible placement settings. On average, 10%\u201320% of ineligible cases for Title IV-E foster care were due to factors like lack of required judicial determinations or being in unlicensed homes. Some states cited \"other\" reasons such as child's age/school attendance or missing legal requirements for ineligibility. Changes in state policy or practice may address declines in federal foster care coverage rates driven by eligibility criteria other than income. Changes in state policy or practice may address declines in federal foster care coverage rates driven by eligibility criteria other than income. States can increase the use of relative placements for children in foster care to potentially increase Title IV-E foster care ineligibility. This can be achieved by actively seeking to license relatives and waiving non-safety licensing standards. Additionally, states can review procedures to ensure required judicial determinations are made in a timely manner and raise awareness among courts about needed findings. Cooperation from the courts is essential for any improvements in this area. The cooperation of the courts is crucial for improving federal funding for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments. States can increase eligibility by utilizing relative placements and ensuring timely judicial determinations. Federal support covers 50% of child placement services and administrative costs under the Title IV-E program. States can claim federal Title IV-E support for administrative costs related to operating a foster care program, with a focus on child-specific case planning and management activities. This funding primarily supports caseworkers in assessing a child and family's needs, developing case plans, and participating in reviews of a child's status. The state child welfare agency can receive federal reimbursement for child-specific activities related to foster care, including court reviews, permanency plans, and transition plans for youth aging out of care. This support is available for children eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, including those living in unlicensed relative homes. The agency can also claim administrative support for children temporarily in care. Title IV-E administrative support can be claimed for a child at imminent risk of removal from home, even if temporarily placed in an ineligible foster care setting, for up to one month. Pre-placement activities, funded by Title IV-E, include child-specific services like court proceedings and finding a suitable home. Children considered \"candidates\" for foster care must be redetermined every 6 months. Federal and state funds cover these costs. The combined federal and state cost for determining Title IV-E foster care eligibility was $184 million in FY2011 (5% of all Title IV-E administrative costs). States can seek federal support for all costs related to Title IV-E eligibility determinations, including determining eligibility for assistance and other administrative costs. This may include licensing requirements, rate setting, background checks, program policies, compliance reviews, and other necessary program costs. Funding for specific administrative purposes may require separate cost allocation processes. In FY2011, there was an apparent increase in Title IV-E foster care administrative costs, particularly in the \"other\" category. This change likely resulted from a new reporting form that no longer includes the \"other\" category but introduced new categories such as \"provider management\" and \"agency management\" to capture additional expenses related to case planning and management for Title IV-E children in foster care. In FY2011, states reported $298 million in provider management costs and $708 million in agency management costs for Title IV-E foster care administration. The introduction of new reporting categories likely influenced how states reported their administrative spending, making comparisons across years challenging. Despite a decline in caseload, administrative spending continued to increase, surpassing maintenance payments in FY2000. In FY2006, Title IV-E foster care administrative costs comprised 55% of all Title IV-E foster care spending, compared to 35% for maintenance payments. By FY2011, administrative costs represented 46% of program costs, a larger share than maintenance payments. Concerns have been raised about the growth of administrative claims, driven by state plan requirements and compliance efforts to improve outcomes for children and families. The focus on compliance in state child welfare agencies aims to enhance outcomes for children and families. Requirements include timely permanency hearings, termination of parental rights when necessary, background checks for caregivers, educational stability plans for foster children, transition plans for aging-out youth, notification of relatives, and annual credit checks for older children in care. Additionally, federal conformity reviews have been implemented to ensure adherence to Title IV-E requirements. The Child and Family Services Review and Title IV-E Eligibility Review have increased Title IV-E administrative costs by driving states to pay closer attention to their child welfare systems. This includes case planning, review, pre-placement, and provider management costs. Participation in these reviews is considered an agency management cost under the Title IV-E program. All children in foster care must receive case planning and review services, with states able to supplement funding with other federal funds if they are not Title IV-E eligible. Recent survey data show a decline in state child welfare agency spending of Medicaid funds, with Title IV-E training support available for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. The total amount of Title IV-E program dollars spent for training purposes has decreased since FY2000. Federal reimbursement for training costs is generally 75% for all states, with most training expenses related to foster care. Training under the Title IV-E program includes activities for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. States can seek federal reimbursement for training costs related to providing care for Title IV-E eligible children. Training topics must be relevant to the Title IV-E program, covering administrative tasks and social work practices. However, training cannot include providing mental health or substance abuse treatment, conducting child abuse investigations, or treating specific needs. The Title IV-E program allows states to seek federal reimbursement for training costs related to caring for eligible children. Training topics must be relevant to the program, covering administrative tasks and social work practices. However, training cannot include mental health or substance abuse treatment, conducting child abuse investigations, or treating specific needs. Additionally, long-term training may be provided to individuals employed by public child welfare agencies or preparing for that employment through direct financial assistance or grants to schools. The federal reimbursement rate for all Title IV-E training claims is 75%. The 2008 act authorized Title IV-E training claims for children, prospective guardians, and individuals handling child abuse cases. Reimbursement rates started at 55% in FY2009, increasing by 5% annually until reaching 75% in FY2013. Most claims are still submitted under pre-existing provisions. In FY2011, 19 states submitted less than $13 million in training claims under the new authority, while all states submitted $284 million under the old authority. The decline in training spending is linked to fewer children eligible for assistance. The broadened authority for federal support was not fully implemented by FY2011. The limited spending by states on training under Title IV-E, along with the discretion states have over training dollars, may explain the lack of increase in overall training claims despite the broadened authority. The Title IV-E plan requires states to adequately prepare foster parents but is mostly silent on training. The weak fiscal position of states post-enactment of P.L. 110-351 also contributes to the lack of increase in training claims. States can claim federal reimbursement under Title IV-E for 50% of the cost to plan, develop, and operate a Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). SACWIS costs may stem from foster care, adoption assistance, or kinship guardianship assistance. As of September 2012, 36 states have an operational SACWIS, three are developing one, and 13 have a non-SACWIS model information system. States are not required to have a SACWIS, but doing so allows them to seek federal reimbursement for costs that would otherwise not be allowed. Under HHS regulations, states must develop comprehensive child welfare data collection systems, including services like foster care and adoption assistance. Congress initially provided a 75% reimbursement rate for SACWIS development costs, which decreased to 50% in FY1998. States can claim federal Title IV-E reimbursement for both development and operation costs of an approved SACWIS, regardless of whether it serves children meeting assistance criteria. States can claim federal Title IV-E reimbursement for both development and operation costs of an approved SACWIS, regardless of whether it serves children meeting assistance criteria. Since the establishment of this funding under Title IV-E, states have invested $4.7 billion in SACWIS operation and development costs, with the federal government reimbursing more than half ($2.6 billion) of those costs. Congress established federal support for assistance to children who cannot be returned home, with specific conditions for adoption assistance. The Title IV-E program provides adoption assistance for children with special needs, aiming to increase the number of children placed in permanent homes. States were required to establish a Title IV-E Adoption Assistance component by FY1983, with the number of children receiving assistance steadily increasing over the years. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 aimed to increase adoptions of children in foster care by expediting permanency planning and providing incentives to states. This led to a significant increase in adoptions, with over 50,000 children adopted annually from FY2000 to FY2011. The number of adoptions out of foster care remained consistently high, with an average time spent in care decreasing from 46 months in FY2000 to 34 months in FY2011. This increase in adoptions led to a growth in children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance, reaching 423,200 by FY2010. However, there was a slight decline in the caseload for FY2011, possibly due to children aging out of the system. The decline in the caseload of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance may be due to various factors such as age eligibility, changes in federal adoption assistance criteria, and data quality concerns. The reported decrease in caseload could also be related to children aging out of the system. Federal adoption assistance under Title IV-E provides reimbursement to states for adoption assistance payments for eligible adopted children with special needs. States must meet requirements for foster care funding, including an approved plan and data reporting. States must also have a written adoption assistance agreement with adoptive parents, providing payments for non-recurring adoption expenses and ongoing monthly subsidies. Additional federal eligibility criteria were based on income and resource limits linked to the prior federal cash aid program until FY2010. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) introduces new federal adoption assistance eligibility rules that delink the program from income or resource tests. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E adoption assistance costs for eligible children includes payments for non-recurring adoption expenses and program administration costs. Adoption assistance payments are reimbursed at the state's FMAP rate, ranging from 50% to 83%, while program-related training costs are reimbursed at 75% in most cases. States with an approved Title IV-E plan can submit adoption assistance claims to HHS quarterly for reimbursement of eligible costs. In FY2011, states received federal reimbursement of 57.8% of the $4.009 billion in adoption assistance expenses. Title IV-E adoption assistance spending is mostly tied to ongoing assistance payments, reimbursed at a higher rate than other claims. Administrative spending accounts for 16-18% of total adoption assistance spending annually. The federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding is typically between 54.0% and 54.5% of the total spending. However, it reached 60% in FY2009 and FY2010 and was close to 58% in FY2011 due to temporary enhanced federal support provided to states. This enhanced funding ended in June 2011. States had obligated over $502 million in federal Title IV-E adoption assistance spending by August 30, 2012, with most of it in FY2009 and FY2010. Spending rose rapidly between FY1997 and FY2002, slowed through FY2010, and declined in FY2011. FY2011 also saw a decrease in the adoption assistance caseload. HHS projected annual growth in federal outlays for Title IV-E adoption assistance through FY2017. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) removes income or resource-related tests from three of the four federal eligibility pathways for Title IV-E adoption assistance. Eligibility for an \"applicable child\" is determined based on age, time spent in foster care, or sibling status. The Title IV-E adoption assistance pathways require special needs children to have been removed from their home via a voluntary placement agreement or judicial determination. Eligibility can also be based on meeting the requirements of the Supplemental Security Income program. A special needs child may be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance if living with a minor parent receiving foster care maintenance payments. If a previous adoption with Title IV-E assistance dissolves, the child remains eligible for assistance in any subsequent adoption. The federal government requires states to reinvest state savings from expanded adoption assistance for children with special needs into child welfare services, including post adoption services. States must provide assurance and document how the funds are spent as mandated by federal laws. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 aims to broaden eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance to most children with special needs. However, some adoptive children may not qualify due to federal criteria, such as completing an adoption assistance agreement and background checks. Table 6 outlines the eligibility criteria for ongoing Title IV-E adoption assistance payments. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expands Title IV-E adoption assistance eligibility to children with special needs. To qualify, a state must determine the child meets special needs criteria and fits one of four eligibility pathways. The child must also meet age, citizenship, and placement requirements. Only children deemed to have special needs by the state are eligible for assistance, based on the child's inability to be returned to parents and the need for adoption assistance for successful adoption. States determine eligibility and make efforts to place the child before providing assistance. States establish conditions for special needs adoption assistance, which must be honored once defined. Sibling group membership is considered a special need factor in every state, with variations in requirements based on group size. Approximately 40 states allow special needs to be established for any sibling group size, while some require additional findings for groups of only two children. Approximately 40 states allow special needs to be established for any sibling group size, while some require additional findings for groups of only two children. Among all states, some require that siblings be placed in the same adoptive home at the same time, while others permit special needs for siblings placed in the same home but at different times. Age is a common special needs condition, with the minimum age requirement varying widely among states. The minimum age to establish special needs for adoption varies among states, with most setting it at five to eight years. Some states allow special needs to be established at any age if the child's age is a barrier to placement. Approximately 14 states have a separate minimum age for special needs based on minority group criteria. Almost half of all states consider a child's membership in a minority group as a factor in establishing special needs status, along with medical, physical, emotional, or behavioral factors. Some states define special needs for adoption based on physical, emotional, or behavioral factors, often requiring documentation by a professional. Two-thirds of states also consider \"high risk\" factors, indicating a likelihood of developing medical conditions or disabilities. Adoption assistance may be contingent on the actual occurrence of symptoms in some cases. Some states define special needs for adoption based on various factors, including the length of time a child has been available for adoption, previous disrupted adoptions, multiple placements, language barriers, adoption by relatives, emotional ties with foster parents, and history of abuse or neglect. The percentage of children adopted with special needs has fluctuated between 84% and 88% annually, with no discernible trend. Membership in a sibling group or having a diagnosed medical condition or disability are primary factors for over half of all children adopted. Age has declined in importance for determining special needs status, while membership in a sibling group and \"other\" reasons have increased in significance. A child's racial/ethnic background is least commonly used as the primary special needs factor. States must enter into an adoption assistance agreement with adoptive parents of children with special needs, specifying payments, services, and Medicaid eligibility. The adoption assistance agreement ensures Medicaid coverage for children with special needs not qualifying for Title IV-E payments. The agreement is binding and can only end if the child reaches the age limit, parents are no longer responsible, or provide no support. Among children adopted from foster care, the majority have adoption assistance agreements with on-going subsidies and Medicaid. A significant portion have used mental health care and tutoring services, even if not included in the agreement. Most children adopted at age 8 or older have not used residential treatment. States may provide monthly adoption assistance payments for eligible children. The federal government provides monthly adoption assistance payments for eligible children placed in adoptive homes. The payment amount is negotiated with the adoptive parents based on the child's needs and the parents' circumstances. Adjustments can be made if circumstances change, but the payment cannot exceed what the child would receive in foster care. There are no restrictions on how the assistance money is spent by the adoptive parents. The adoptive parents receive monthly adoption assistance payments based on the child's needs and the parents' circumstances. The payment amount varies by state and can range from $301 to $750 a month. Two-thirds of children adopted from foster care felt that the payment amount met the child's needs. Some families of Title IV-E-eligible children with special needs may not receive ongoing adoption assistance payments. Having an adoption assistance agreement in place before finalizing the adoption allows for future payments to be established if needed, ensuring the child's Medicaid eligibility. State spending on Title IV-E adoption assistance payments is shown in Table 8 for FY1997 to FY2011, with support for special needs adoptees not meeting federal criteria coming from non-Title IV-E sources. There is no reliable data on the total number of special needs adoptees adopted. State agencies provided data on the share of children receiving adoption assistance payments under the Title IV-E program in FY2010. The median coverage rate was 76%, with most states reporting rates of 71% or higher. Non-recurring adoption expenses are defined as necessary fees related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs. States are required to reimburse adoptive parents for non-recurring adoption expenses for children with special needs, regardless of federal eligibility pathways. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 specifies that children with special needs who are not citizens or residents of the US are not eligible for federal adoption assistance. States can claim federal reimbursement for 50% of non-recurring adoption expenses for these children. States are required to reimburse adoptive parents for non-recurring adoption expenses for children with special needs, with a maximum federal support of $2,000 per child. Roughly half of the states reimburse costs up to $2,000, while others limit reimbursement to smaller amounts. In FY2011, 41 states reported total spending on reimbursement for non-recurring adoption expenses. In FY2011, 41 states reported spending $37.7 million on non-recurring adoption expenses, with federal reimbursement covering half of that amount. The percentage of children adopted with public agency involvement receiving monthly subsidies has remained stable, but the share supported by federal Title IV-E dollars has decreased. Federally supported adoption subsidies accounted for 75% of adoptions in FY2000, dropping to 66% in FY2011. The decline in adoptions completed with public child welfare agency involvement is expected to be reversed due to federal support for special needs adoptees. The Title IV-E adoption assistance pathway, linked to prior law AFDC program criteria, may depress federal eligibility for some children. FY2011 marked the phase-in of new eligibility rules removing the income standard from Title IV-E eligibility. The new eligibility rules for federal Title IV-E adoption assistance removed the income standard requirement for children aged 14 or older. The majority of children eligible for adoption assistance had to meet income criteria in FY2010 and FY2011. The median age of children adopted from foster care has remained around five years for the past five years. The \"applicable child\" eligibility rules may not apply to most children adopted from foster care until at least FY2015. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments for children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with relatives. This federal support aims to reduce the overrepresentation of African American children in foster care. States have the option to provide this assistance by amending their Title IV-E plan. States can seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance by amending their Title IV-E plan. As of September 2012, 31 states had submitted plan amendments, with most not yet claiming reimbursement. States can seek reimbursement for expenses up to two years after incurring them, following the effective date of the plan amendment. States can seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance by amending their Title IV-E plan. Through FY2011, three states had submitted post-demonstration related kinship guardianship assistance claims. Kinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of eligible children are reimbursed at the state's FMAP. Administrative costs for the program may be reimbursed at 50%. States can claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance, including funds for non-recurring costs of legal guardianship. They can also seek reimbursement for training related to serving children under Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance, with a federal reimbursement rate of 75%. Table 12 displays eligible spending and federal reimbursement for states under this program through FY2011. The average monthly number of children assisted is also provided. HHS estimates federal outlays for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance to increase to $81 million for FY2013 and $174 million by FY2017, with 14,000 and 28,000 children assisted monthly, respectively. The Title IV-E agency must outline steps taken to determine permanency options for children placed with relative guardians receiving kinship guardianship assistance. Discussions on adoption as a more permanent alternative to legal guardianship must also be documented in the foster child's case plan. To be eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments, there must be a kinship guardianship assistance agreement in place between the state agency and the eligible prospective relative guardian. The child must have been eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments while living in the home of that relative guardian. This case plan requirement applies to children in foster care, and once they leave foster care permanently, there is no requirement for the Title IV-E agency to maintain a case plan for the child. Eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments is tied to a child's previous eligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments while living with a prospective relative guardian. The child must have entered foster care through a voluntary placement agreement or a court determination that living at home was not in their best interest. The family's income must also meet eligibility standards. The eligibility criteria for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments require the child to have been eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments while living with a prospective relative guardian. The home must meet licensing requirements for a foster family home, and the guardian must pass federal background checks. States must conduct specific background checks before kinship guardianship assistance payments can be received. When a foster parent seeks to become a child's relative guardian, if the background check remains valid and the time frame has not expired, the state may consider the requirement met. To receive Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments, the individual must have been the child's foster parent for at least six consecutive months, met licensing requirements, and have no prohibited felony convictions. The legal guardian must be a grandparent or relative with a commitment to care for the child permanently through legal guardianship. States can define \"relative\" for their kinship guardianship assistance program. To be eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments, a state must determine that neither reunification with parents nor adoption are suitable options for the child. The child must have a strong attachment to the prospective relative guardian, and if aged 14 or older, must be consulted about the guardianship arrangement. Assistance may continue after age 18 if the child has a disability or if the state extends assistance up to age 21. States can provide extended assistance to youth in Title IV-E kinship guardianship arrangements if they entered the arrangement after age 16 and meet certain requirements. Siblings of eligible children can also receive assistance if they are placed with the same relative guardian and both parties agree to the joint placement. The sibling does not need to meet all eligibility requirements. HHS allows states to impose additional conditions on Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance eligibility, beyond federal law requirements. States must get HHS approval for these conditions. Examples include longer foster care residency with the guardian, minimum age requirements, and cooperation with child support enforcement. States seeking reimbursement must have a written kinship guardianship agreement in place. The kinship guardianship assistance agreement must be in writing and binding, specifying payment details, additional services, and non-recurring expenses. It remains valid as long as the child meets eligibility criteria and the relative guardian remains legally responsible. The kinship guardianship assistance agreement must be in writing and binding, specifying payment details, additional services, and non-recurring expenses. The relative guardian remains legally responsible for the child and as long as providing support. The law ensures that the kinship guardianship assistance payment is not more than what the child would receive in foster care. Any child eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance is categorically eligible for Medicaid. Tribal participation in the Title IV-E program allows tribes to receive support for foster care. The Port Gamble S'Klallam tribe became the first tribe to independently operate a Title IV-E program in 2012. Other tribes are working towards approval for their plans. States and tribes can enter agreements for Title IV-E funds to support children in tribal custody. The federal reimbursement rate for children under tribal authority is equal to the tribal FMAP. The Appendix provides an overview of the statutory provisions related to tribal receipt of direct federal funding under the Title IV-E program. Requirements for Direct Title IV-E Funding to Tribes include applying the same requirements and entitlements as states, with modifications for tribes defining service areas in their plans and demonstrating compliance with audit exceptions. The law clarifies that tribal Title IV-E plans must be submitted with contracts related to social services administration. Licensing of foster family homes and child care institutions must be done by tribal authorities. Eligibility for tribal Title IV-E programs is similar to state programs. AFDC rules from the state where the child lived when removed from home apply for eligibility. Tribal licensing standards apply for approving foster homes and child care institutions. Background checks for caregivers remain a separate requirement under tribal Title IV-E plans. Under a tribal Title IV-E plan, background checks for prospective foster or adoptive parents must meet all requirements in the Social Security Act. Tribes seeking direct Title IV-E funding must have an approved plan that meets federal requirements and have processes in place for federal reimbursement. Foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance payments are reimbursed under the program. Under a tribal Title IV-E plan, reimbursement for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance payments is based on a tribe's unique FMAP, which must not be lower than any state's rate and cannot exceed 83%. Tribal training costs are reimbursed at 75%, while child placement and administrative costs are covered at 50% of eligible spending. Tribes can only seek federal reimbursement for costs related to Title IV-E eligible children, requiring accurate eligibility determination. Tribes must accurately determine Title IV-E eligibility to receive federal support. They need a valid cost allocation methodology for training and administrative claims, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs as the \"cognizant\" agency. Any unreimbursed Title IV-E spending must come from non-federal sources. Certain federal funds received by tribes can count as \"non-federal.\" Tribes can use federal funds from specific programs as \"non-federal\" dollars for Title IV-E spending. They are allowed to use third-party in-kind expenditures for administrative and training costs. Data collection and reporting requirements include submitting data on children in foster care electronically to the HHS Children's Bureau. The tribal Title IV-E agency must report data on children in foster care and adoption, regardless of their eligibility for Title IV-E assistance. Tribes seeking direct funding need a system to track children in foster care, such as a Tribal Automated Child Welfare Information System (TACWIS). Approved tribes can claim federal reimbursement for developing and operating the data collection system. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) outlines federal rules for transferring child custody proceedings from state to tribal courts. Tribes with approved Title IV-E plans can submit administrative claims for operating a data collection system. Reporting data via NCANDS and NYTD is not required for tribes operating a Title IV-E program. The Fostering Connections Act mandated HHS to regulate the transfer of child care responsibilities from state to tribal agencies for Title IV-E and Medicaid eligibility. Interim regulations issued in 2012 require states to establish transfer procedures in consultation with tribes, ensuring eligibility determination and providing essential documents for continued assistance. The Fostering Connections Act mandated HHS to regulate the transfer of child care responsibilities from state to tribal agencies for Title IV-E and Medicaid eligibility. Essential documentation for Title IV-E eligibility includes judicial determinations, case plans, placement settings, and other federal program eligibility information. Tribal Title IV-E Implementation Grants provide up to $300,000 for tribes developing and submitting Title IV-E plans. The Fostering Connections Act mandated HHS to regulate the transfer of child care responsibilities from state to tribal agencies for Title IV-E and Medicaid eligibility. Tribal Title IV-E Implementation Grants provide up to $300,000 for tribes developing and submitting Title IV-E plans. These grants are available to tribes planning to submit a Title IV-E plan within 24 months, with the requirement to repay the grant if the plan is not submitted within that timeframe. HHS can waive repayment if circumstances beyond the tribe's control caused the delay. The grants can be used for various development costs related to implementing a Title IV-E program. The HHS awarded tribal implementation grants to 12 tribes, tribal organizations, or consortiums, including Tohono O'odham Nation, Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes, and Navajo Nation. These tribes are working to finalize their Title IV-E plans. HHS also provides technical assistance to tribes regarding child welfare programs authorized in Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. In September 2009, HHS awarded funding to the Tribal Law and Policy Institute for a National Resource Center for Tribes, expected to last up to five years.
