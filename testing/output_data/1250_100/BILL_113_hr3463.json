The \"Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013\" aims to strengthen U.S. Customs and Border Protection by ensuring Border Patrol agents are ready for necessary work and can perform overtime hours as needed. It also provides flexibility for shift changes and work assignments based on operational requirements. The Act introduces a new section, \"Border Patrol rate of pay,\" in the United States Code to define terms like \"available to work\" and \"Border Patrol agent.\" The \"Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013\" defines terms like \"Border Patrol agent\" as individuals performing specific functions related to border enforcement. Covered activities include detecting illegal entry, making arrests, attending training, and being on leave or travel status. The \"Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013\" defines various activities for Border Patrol agents, including administrative leave, travel status, official time, excused absence for relocation, light duty, administrative duties, caring for assigned canines, and similar activities away from regular duty. The term \"level 1 border patrol rate of pay\" is defined as 1.25 times the agent's hourly basic pay rate. The \"Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013\" defines the level 1 and level 2 border patrol rates of pay for Border Patrol agents, with level 1 being 1.25 times the basic pay rate and level 2 being 1.125 times the basic pay rate. Agents must elect their pay level annually. The Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013 establishes level 2 border patrol rates of pay. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will set procedures for agent elections. U.S. Customs and Border Protection must provide agents with election information annually. Failure to elect results in a default election. Congress recommends limiting the number of agents affected to 10 percent. More than 10 percent of Border Patrol agents decline to be assigned to level 1 or level 2 border patrol rates of pay. Level 1 border patrol rate of pay includes 8 hours of regular time per day and 2 additional hours of scheduled overtime, with pay at the level 1 rate. Regularly scheduled overtime does not receive additional compensation. The Border Patrol agent shall receive compensatory time off or pay at the overtime hourly rate of pay for hours of work in excess of 100 hours during a work period, as determined in accordance with section 5542(a)(7). The agent shall be charged leave in increments of 8 hours for 1 shift of leave, regardless of the length of the shift. The Border Patrol agent is scheduled to work 5 days a week, with 8 hours of regular time per day and 1 additional hour of scheduled overtime each day. Regular time work pays at the level 2 border patrol rate, while overtime work does not receive additional compensation or compensatory time off.

They are eligible for premium pay for night work, Sunday, and holiday pay, but not for any other form of premium pay.

The Border Patrol agent's rate of pay, including the level 2 border patrol rate, is considered as basic pay for various purposes outlined in the regulations. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has the authority to require overtime work as needed, even in emergencies. Additionally, a Border Patrol agent may elect to be assigned to the level 1 border patrol rate of pay for overtime work. Border Patrol agents can elect to be assigned to different pay levels for overtime work. For those at the level 1 border patrol rate, overtime work is defined as hours exceeding 100 in a 14-day period, with compensation either in pay at the overtime rate or compensatory time off.

Border Patrol agents can receive compensatory time off for hours of overtime work that are officially ordered or approved in advance. There is a limit of 8 hours of overtime work per 14-day pay period, but this limit can be waived by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Agents cannot earn more than 240 hours of compensatory time off in a year and must use any accrued time off within 1 year. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include Border Patrol agents as eligible for compensatory time off for overtime work. Border Patrol agents are now eligible for compensatory time off for overtime work."
