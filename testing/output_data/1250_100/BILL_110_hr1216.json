Safety Act of 2007\" mandates the Secretary of Transportation to consider implementing safety standards for power windows on motor vehicles to prevent accidents involving children and others. If deemed reasonable, practicable, and appropriate, these standards must be prescribed within 30 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will report to Congress if no additional safety standards are deemed feasible, and will provide information to the public on vehicles with power windows that automatically reverse when obstructed. Additionally, within 12 months, a rulemaking will be initiated to expand rearward visibility in vehicles to enhance driver awareness and reduce accidents. The Secretary will establish safety standards for motor vehicles to improve rearward visibility, reducing accidents involving small children and disabled persons. Compliance with the standards must be achieved within 48 months of the final rule issuance. The Secretary will prioritize phasing in rearward visibility safety standards for different types of motor vehicles based on backing incident data. Motor vehicles with automatic transmission manufactured after September 1, 2010, must have a system that requires the brake to be depressed before shifting out of \"park\".
