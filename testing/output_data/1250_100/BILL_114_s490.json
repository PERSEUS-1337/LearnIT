    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Land Freedom Act of 2015\" and includes findings. The \"Federal Land Freedom Act of 2015\" finds that there are 113,000,000 acres of onshore Federal land open for oil and gas development, while 166,000,000 acres are off-limits. Despite a recent boom, leased Federal land for oil and gas exploration has decreased by 24% since 2008. In 2013, only 36,000,000 acres were leased, compared to 131,000,000 acres in 1984, harming economic growth and Federal revenues. It took 197 days to process drilling permits on Federal land in 2013, while states have sufficient regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nAvailable Federal land refers to Federal land within a State not held for Indian tribes, National Park or Wildlife Refuge Systems, or designated wilderness areas. State includes a State and the District of Columbia. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory program regulates energy exploration on State land.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE CONTROL OF ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ON ALL AVAILABLE FEDERAL LAND. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory programs allow states to declare and seek responsibility for energy development on federal land. States can lease, permit, and regulate oil, natural gas, and other energy forms instead of the federal government. State actions are not considered federal actions under this provision. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for actions to be considered Federal actions, permits, or licenses under various federal laws including the Administrative Procedure Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Endangered Species Act, and National Environmental Policy Act. These laws govern the process for federal actions and permits. The curr_chunk outlines the provisions for collecting royalties or revenues on leases or permits issued by a State on Federal land, ensuring no impact on Federal revenues. State-collected revenues must be deposited in the same Federal account as if issued by the Federal Government, while States can still charge processing fees for administrative costs."
