    "content": "The federal government has been involved in collecting educational statistics for over 150 years. The National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were established in the 1970s to centralize research efforts. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) replaced NIE in 1985, and later the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) took over in 2002 under the Education Sciences Reform Act. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) with a Director appointed by the President. ESRA also created a technical panel, the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES), to advise the Director and oversee research priorities. Three National Education Centers were established: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). P.L. 108-446 added the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) to IES. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) with a Director appointed by the President and created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to oversee research priorities. ESRA also led to the creation of the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). Additionally, ESRA authorized grants for technical assistance activities and statewide data systems, and emphasized \"scientifically-based\" or \"scientifically-valid\" standards for research. ESRA established IES and NBES, created NCER, NCES, and NCEE, authorized grants for technical assistance and data systems, and emphasized scientifically based research standards. Funding for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA continued through appropriations. House passed H.R. 4366 in 113th Congress, Senate passed S. 227 in 114th Congress for reauthorization. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established IES as a research institute within ED to provide national leadership in expanding knowledge of education. IES aims to provide information on education progress, practices that improve academic achievement, and the effectiveness of federal education programs. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to provide national leadership in expanding knowledge of education. IES aims to compile statistics, conduct research and evaluations, and disseminate information on education progress and the effectiveness of federal education programs. The IES Director is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and is responsible for proposing research priorities, establishing review procedures, advising the Secretary, and ensuring activities are objective and free of bias. ESRA also authorized the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) to advise and consult with the Director on IES policies, research priorities, and grant funding. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to provide national leadership in expanding knowledge of education. ESRA specifies requirements related to the Board, including composition, qualification, compensation, and travel expenses. IES is composed of four research centers, each with specific duties outlined in ESRA. The National Center for Education Research (NCER) has specific duties outlined in ESRA to sponsor research that improves student academic achievement, closes achievement gaps, and promotes postsecondary education. NCER maintains peer-review processes, proposes research plans, ensures research relevance to education practice and policy, and disseminates research findings. The Commissioner of NCER is authorized to support national research and development centers focusing on various education topics. Grants are awarded for up to five years, with the possibility of continuation grants for up to 10 years. The research plan includes basic and applied research, field-initiated research efforts, and ongoing initiatives, with at least 50% of funds allocated for long-term research. NCES is authorized to use 50% of funds for long-term research programs of at least five years. Its primary duty is to collect, analyze, and disseminate education statistics objectively and timely. Other duties include publishing reports on collected statistics, setting standards for state educational agencies, and comparing student achievement with other nations. The Commissioner of NCES is authorized to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for collecting data on various education topics such as student achievement, school violence, teacher supply, educational technology, and more. ESRA specifies the data that must be collected, including information on state and local education reform activities, student achievement in reading, math, and science, school completions and dropouts, teacher practices, violence affecting students, education financing, children's social and economic status, and more. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) requires data collection on various education topics such as student achievement, school violence, teacher supply, and educational technology. Data must be disaggregated by gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other population characteristics to facilitate decision-making. The National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) supports evaluation, technical assistance, and dissemination activities to determine the impact of federal education programs on student academic achievement in core areas. NCEE encourages the use of scientifically valid education research and evaluation throughout the United States. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) mandates evaluations by the National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) through grants, contracts, and technical assistance. NCEE must adhere to high standards for scientifically valid evaluations, focusing on Title I programs and supplementing other federal education evaluations. NCEE's technical assistance is primarily provided through the Regional Educational Laboratories (REL) program, which conducts research, development, and dissemination activities to meet regional needs. The Director of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) contracts with 10 RELs to serve children nationwide, with specific objectives and measurable indicators to assess their performance. The Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) provide training and technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, school boards, and state boards of education on ESEA implementation, research on teaching methods, and dissemination of educational practices. The RELs also facilitate communication between educational experts and stakeholders to develop plans to meet state education goals. NCEE evaluates the RELs and NCSER sponsors research to expand knowledge. NCSER, under ESRA, sponsors research to improve services under IDEA, identify best practices for learning and academic achievement, align state standards for students with disabilities, address overidentification and underidentification of children with disabilities, improve personnel preparation, and examine the special needs of limited English proficient children. The National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) conducts research to enhance services under IDEA, identify best practices for academic achievement, address overidentification and underidentification of children with disabilities, improve personnel preparation, and examine the needs of limited English proficient children with disabilities. NCSER is authorized to award grants for research activities in accordance with established standards. ESRA Part F includes provisions on confidentiality, data availability, performance management, and appropriations for funding research activities. Funding for NCSER and related activities was authorized for FY2003 and subsequent fiscal years. Title II of P.L. 107-279, known as the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA), authorizes grants for technical assistance and evaluation. The Secretary can award grants for comprehensive centers to provide training, disseminate information, and develop teacher training models. Each center must work with SEAs, LEAs, and schools in its region. Funding has continued through annual appropriations legislation since FY2008. The Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) authorizes grants for comprehensive centers to provide training, disseminate information, and develop teacher training models. Each center must coordinate activities with its local REL, NCEE, state service agency, and other technical assistance providers. The Secretary conducts independent evaluations of the centers and reports to congressional committees. The Secretary can also make competitive grants to SEAs for statewide longitudinal data systems. Funding for these activities was authorized until FY2008. The National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) established the National Assessment Governing Board and charges the Commissioner of Education Statistics with conducting the NAEP assessments. NAEP includes national, state, long-term trend, and urban district assessment programs. Participation in NAEP assessments is voluntary for students, schools, and local entities. The NAEP assessment is voluntary for students, schools, and local educational agencies. The Assessment Board includes various stakeholders and sets duties such as selecting subject areas, developing achievement levels, and ensuring validity and reliability of assessments. The National Assessment Governing Board ensures the validity and reliability of assessment items, measures student academic achievement in grades 4, 8, and 12, develops guidelines for reporting results, and plans the release of National Assessment of Educational Progress reports. Funding for these activities has been ongoing through annual appropriations legislation. The Education through Research Act (H.R. 4366) and a similar Senate bill (S. 227) aimed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, with changes in IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and accountability. Both bills proposed giving the Director of IES more authority and amending provisions related to NBES independence and board composition. The Education through Research Act and a Senate bill aimed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA with changes in IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and accountability. Both bills proposed giving the Director of IES more authority and amending provisions related to NBES independence and board composition, including requirements for practitioner board members and peer review processes for grants and contracts exceeding $100,000. The bills proposed changes in IES research standards, including requiring peer review for grants and contracts, renaming \"scientifically based research standards\" to \"principles of scientific research,\" and allowing strong claims of causal relationships only with research designs that eliminate competing explanations. The bills also adjusted research priorities for IES, focusing on educational problems relevant to federal laws and improving early childhood and K-12 education quality.

The bills also adjusted research priorities for IES, focusing on improving the quality of early childhood and K-12 education. Both bills aimed to streamline the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs), limiting the number of RELs to not more than 10 and specifying their mission as conducting applied research, development, evaluation, and dissemination activities. The bills proposed changes in IES research standards, including peer review for grants and contracts, renaming \"scientifically based research standards\" to \"principles of scientific research,\" and allowing strong claims of causal relationships only with research designs that eliminate competing explanations. Both bills aimed to streamline the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs), limiting the number of RELs to not more than 10 and specifying their mission as conducting applied research, development, evaluation, and dissemination activities. H.R. 4366 and S. 227 would assign technical assistance responsibility to ED-administered Comprehensive Centers, with a limit of 17 awards. The Secretary would have the authority to determine the appropriate number of centers in consultation with advisory boards, based on performance indicators and regional needs.

The Secretary would have the authority to determine the appropriate number of centers in consultation with advisory boards, based on performance indicators and regional needs. Both bills would have designated IES as the primary entity responsible for conducting research on and evaluations of federal education programs and programs within ED, aiming to ensure rigor and independence of such research and evaluation. Both bills would have authorized the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of IES, to reserve not more than 0.5% of appropriated funds for each program under ESEA (other than Part A of Title I) and 0.25% of appropriated funds for Part A of Title I for evaluations of programs authorized under ESEA. Both bills would have authorized the Secretary to consolidate funds reserved for ESEA evaluation and specified no requirement to evaluate all programs authorized under ESEA. Both bills would have required the Director of IES, in consultation with the Secretary, to submit an ESEA evaluation plan to Congress on a biennial basis. Both bills would have clarified the Commissioner of Education Statistics' duty to protect the privacy and identity of individuals on whom data are collected. The bills aimed to amend the role of the National Assessment Governing Board and required evaluations of National Education Centers. They proposed an expanded performance management system with measurable indicators for IES activities. Renewal of IES-supported grants would be tied to progress on these indicators. The bills propose changes to the renewal process for NCER national research and development centers and Statistics Commissioner grants, requiring progress in meeting performance management system requirements. Renewal authority would be for up to two years instead of five, and recipients must demonstrate progress. The Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner and Special Education Research Commissioner would also have renewed support authority for up to two years, with recipients needing to show progress. Directors must report on all awards within 120 days. Both bills would codify current regulatory requirements for data access on grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements within 120 days of the award. They would authorize specific levels of appropriations for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA for FY2015 through FY2020. The bills would also allocate 16.13% of funds appropriated for ESRA to the RELs, instead of a fixed amount for FY2003 and subsequent years."
