    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The vouchers cover the difference between rent and the tenant's contribution (30% of adjusted income) and are administered by local public housing authorities. The cost to a PHA is based on the tenant's actual rent or the maximum subsidy level, adjusting with changes in tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards. HUD has made changes to the voucher renewal funding distribution to local PHAs, causing funding uncertainty and pressure on Congress to enact permanent funding reform. The funding formula changes started in FY2003, with PHAs previously funded based on average per-voucher cost, adjusted for inflation. Despite full funding, few PHAs leased all authorized vouchers, leading to concerns about low utilization rates. Congress has been addressing this issue through annual appropriations. In FY2000 and FY2001, national voucher utilization rates were just over 91%, below the expected 95% for PHAs. PHAs had low budget utilization due to not using all vouchers, resulting in excess funds. HUD reconciled budgets with PHAs and recaptured excess funds. Funding for tenant-based Section 8 vouchers was determined based on actual costs and inflation. PHAs could use excess funds for new vouchers through maximized leasing. Congress provided more funds each year based on costs. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for PHAs to limit recaptures of unspent funds and provide more accurate funding levels based on actual voucher use. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, and multiplied by the number of vouchers expected to be leased. This change reduced the amount of appropriations needed for the program. HUD implemented a provision to base PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from their financial statements, adjusted for inflation. Renewal calculations for FY2003 were based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data. Funding increments were generally renewed for three months to enable more accurate funding calculations. HUD implemented short renewal terms to calculate funding more accurately. Congress created a Central Reserve fund for PHAs to replenish reserves if needed. Restrictions were placed on maximized leasing to prevent over-leasing issues. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the direction of the FY2003 law, funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricting funds for maximized leasing. The conference report expressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program and expected the Secretary to control costs by renewing expiring contracts based on leased unit months. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the direction of the FY2003 law, funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricting funds for maximized leasing. The Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 implementing the FY2004 appropriations law. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 (PIH 2004-7) implementing the FY2004 appropriations law. PHAs' budgets would be based on their utilization rates and costs from their end-of-the-year statements as of August 1, 2003, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF). PHAs could appeal if rental costs had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400 that applied, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on their voucher costs and utilization rates as of specific time periods. If data was not available, funding would be based on financial statements. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve provided. HUD would provide flexibility for agencies to adjust payment standards and policies as needed. The FY2005 appropriations act made changes to how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided guidance on budget adjustments, with agencies notified of preliminary budget levels in December 2004. Appeals were limited to data errors, with final calculations published in January 2005. The FY2005 appropriations act changed how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, with agencies funded at 4.03% less than actual costs plus the 2005 AAF. The proration factor of 96% was due to insufficient funding from Congress. HUD analysis showed a median increase of 0.17% in PHA renewal budgets, with a wide variance. HUD also provided options for PHAs to lower costs in 2005, such as adjusting payment standards and monitoring income eligibility. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) continued funding PHAs based on the previous year's eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. The Secretary had $45 million to adjust agency budgets for low leasing or unforeseen costs. PHAs received projected funding letters in January 2006, with Congress providing insufficient funds for full funding. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided insufficient funding for PHAs, leading to funding at 94% of their eligibility. Changes enacted up to FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, resulting in flat average annual per voucher costs from 2004 to 2005 and a 1.5% decline from 2005 to 2006. Utilization dropped from over 98% in 2004 to around 90% in September 2006, leading to 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from 2005 to 2006. In FY2007, the debate continued between a budget-based funding formula and a unit-based formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula, but Congress rejected this proposal in the final FY2007 appropriations law. 168 PHAs were at their cap on authorized vouchers, with excess funding they were not permitted to use. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal for a budget-based funding formula for PHAs. Instead, the law adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors. The law included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain PHAs. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's budget-based funding formula for PHAs. Instead, a formula based on leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months was adopted, with adjustments for various factors. Certain PHAs received funding based on their FY2006 amounts, with exceptions for agencies affected by Hurricane Katrina and those under receivership. The funding provided was sufficient to fund all PHAs at more than 105% of their eligibility. The FY2007 formula for PHAs funding was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed a strictly \"budget-based\" formula, similar to FY2007. Agencies were to be funded based on their eligibility in 2007, adjusted for certain factors, and pro-rated to fit within the appropriated amount. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies, similar to FY2007. It included adjustments for leasing costs, AAF, FSS deposits, tenant protection vouchers, and project-based commitments. The Act also provided a central reserve fund for HUD to make adjustments and an alternative formula for specific categories of agencies. Additionally, it included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in FY2008 renewal funding, freeing up unusable reserves above 7% of total funding. This allowed Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without affecting total funding available to PHAs. In FY2009, President Bush proposed a budget-based funding formula, but Congress maintained a hybrid formula based on cost and utilization. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding, allowing Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without affecting total funding available to PHAs. In FY2009, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on the number and cost of vouchers leased in FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors. PHAs were expected to supplement their allocations with unused Net Restricted Assets. HUD also included a $100 million renewal set-aside for adjustments under certain circumstances. HUD based CY2009 allocations on utilization and cost data submitted by PHAs for FY2008. Some PHAs faced funding shortfalls in CY2009 due to inaccurate estimates of costs and utilization by HUD. Approximately 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program were affected. HUD provided additional funding from a $100 million renewal set-aside and advised agencies on cost-cutting measures. PHAs with insufficient funding may have to stop issuing vouchers, leading to families losing assistance. In response to funding shortfalls in CY2009, HUD provided additional funding to PHAs at risk of terminating assistance to families. Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million to prevent assistance termination. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, with the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves. The Administration requested authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing or needy agencies. The FY2010 funding law adopted a similar formula but did not grant the Secretary the authority to offset budgets or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. FY2011 and FY2012 funding laws allocated Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding based on costs and utilization, with no offset from PHA reserves in FY2011 and a $650 million rescission in FY2012. Following changes in funding formulas from FY2003 to FY2006, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) saw a decrease in the number of families served and a lower utilization of federal funding. However, with the shift to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model, PHAs have started to see an increase in funding utilization, serving over 150,000 more families by the end of 2009 compared to 2006. This marks a significant increase in families served compared to 2003. By the end of FY2009, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) had spent down reserves due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Some Members of Congress have introduced voucher reform legislation, but Appropriations Committees have the authority to override any new funding formula. Prior to FY2003, the Section 8 voucher program was funded like an entitlement program. The Section 8 voucher program was initially funded like an entitlement program, with Congress determining the amount based on a formula. However, funding changes enacted from FY2003 converted the program to a fixed sum structure, giving Congress more control over the budget but making it harder for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to administer the program efficiently. PHAs have limited control over costs, as subsidies are statutorily set based on rent and income. Many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) made changes to the Section 8 voucher program by lowering payment standards, conducting rent reviews, and selecting higher-income families. Some PHAs intentionally reduced their utilization rates to save money, leading to fewer households receiving vouchers in FY2005. Changes to the Section 8 voucher program in FY2005 and FY2006 resulted in fewer households receiving vouchers, as voucher costs leveled off and utilization rates declined. Some agencies had more funding than they could spend, leading to calls for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula by low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the one in place before changes began. PHAs were funded based on previous year's usage, not received amount. PHAs with large surpluses received less funding, but program had enough to serve all families. FY2008 and FY2009 formulas followed closely, with reductions for agencies with excess reserves. Rescissions and offsets made unused funding usable, reducing appropriations needed. The funding model for PHAs changed from a budget-based to a cost and utilization-based model, leading to increased costs and utilization. Rising costs may pressure policy makers to contain costs, which could impact the number of families served. Future cost containment strategies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation includes formula changes to maximize efficiency. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation aims to maximize the number of families served without firmly capping future cost growth, which could be overridden by future appropriations legislation."
