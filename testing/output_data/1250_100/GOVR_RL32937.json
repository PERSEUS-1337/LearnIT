    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and funded by general revenues, providing services to families receiving TANF benefits. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program provides services to families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage. Child support collected on behalf of non-welfare families goes to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly. However, the program still only collects 18% of child support obligations for which it is responsible. The CSE program handles 50% of child support cases, providing services like parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment, modification, and collection methods such as income withholding and intercepts. Legislation like P.L. 105-187 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. P.L. 104-193 mandated states to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and seizing assets. It also required states to withhold licenses and conduct data matches with financial institutions to seize resources of noncustodial parents in debt. Additionally, the law authorized the denial, revocation, or restriction of passports for parents in debt. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established by P.L. 104-193, required states to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) and expand full faith and credit procedures. It clarified jurisdiction in cases with multiple child support orders and established reimbursement and incentive payment systems for states. The CSE program aims to promote self-sufficiency, parental responsibility, and strengthen families. The CSE program aims to strengthen families by securing financial support for children from noncustodial parents, helping families remain self-sufficient, and reducing reliance on public assistance. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, with an average of 17% of family income coming from child support. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 seek to improve the CSE program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for all single-parent families. Both bills aim to simplify CSE rules, strengthen \"family-first\" policies, and enhance enforcement tools. The Senate Finance Committee-reported bill includes a larger list of CSE provisions than the House Subcommittee bill. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state, with assigned collections kept by states and the federal government. Nonwelfare families applying for CSE services do not need to assign their child support rights. The assignment process for child support rights depends on the date it was entered. If entered before September 30, 1997, all arrearages are permanently assigned to the state. If entered after October 1, 1997, only arrearages during assistance are permanently assigned. Under S. 667, only child support accrued during TANF benefits would be assigned to the state, not pre-assistance arrearages. Child support collected on behalf of former TANF families for pre-assistance arrearages would go to the family. H.R. 240 does not change child support assignment rules. Distribution rules determine the order of child support payments, with states deciding how much to pass through to the family. The federal government requires states to pay their share of child support collections for TANF families. Some states continue to pass through and disregard a portion of child support payments to families. Two bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing child support to families rather than reimbursing welfare benefits. The bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing and support for state pass-through policies. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for state pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay child support directly to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. In contrast, the House bill H.R. 240 incentivizes states to increase pass-through policies without requiring federal reimbursement. The House bill proposes subsidized child support pass-through payments for former TANF families, with federal cost-sharing limited to $100 per month or $50 more than the state's previous share. States must prioritize distributing child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursement. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritized distributing child support to families after leaving TANF, aiming to reduce dependence on public assistance. Child support accrued before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. S. 667 would allow states to give former TANF families full child support collected on their behalf, simplifying the distribution process and eliminating special treatment of arrearages. The CSE distribution process would be simplified under S. 667 and H.R. 240, allowing states to share costs with the federal government for paying child support arrearages to families. Both bills also include provisions for passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and using the federal income tax refund offset program for past-due child support. The bill includes provisions for passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and using the federal income tax refund offset program to collect past-due child support. It also authorizes the HHS Secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents who owe child support with insurer information and allows assisting states to establish child support interstate cases. Additional provisions in the bill expand states' ability to collect child support payments, such as seizing financial assets of noncustodial parents and requiring medical support for children. The CSE agency notifies health care plan administrators when a child loses coverage. Both bills require states to review and adjust child support orders of TANF families every three years. They also establish minimum funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service. H.R. 240 includes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services. S. 667 increases funding for the CSE access and visitation program and allows Texas to adopt a later version of UIFSA for interstate child support cases. The comparison of child support provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240 with current law shows differences in funding levels, fee requirements, and interstate case handling. Texas is allowed to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver."
