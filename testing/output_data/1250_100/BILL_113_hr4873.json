    "content": "The \"Cabin Fee Act of 2014\" may be cited as the official title. It pertains to cabin user fees. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a fee for special use permits on National Forest System land for recreational residences. An interim fee will be assessed until the current appraisal cycle is completed, with the fee not exceeding $5,600 or a 25% increase over the previous year's fee determined under the Cabin User Fees Fairness Act. The Secretary must complete the current appraisal cycle for recreational residences within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will establish fees for special use permits on National Forest System land for recreational residences based on appraisals conducted during the current appraisal cycle. A 1-time adjustment to the value of each appraised lot will be made before assessing fees. After appraising each lot with a recreational residence, a 1-time adjustment will be made to reflect any value changes since the last appraisal, based on the 4th quarter of 2012 National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index. Following this adjustment, the Secretary will implement a tiered fee structure for annual fees for recreational residences on National Forest System land. The fee structure for annual permits for recreational residences on National Forest System land is tiered, with fees ranging from $600 to $5,600 based on different tiers representing varying percentages of permits nationally. The Secretary adjusts annual fees based on changes in the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product.
