    "content": "The basic intent of HIPAA's health insurance provisions is to ensure individuals and small employers maintain coverage, facilitate plan switching, and prevent denial of coverage due to preexisting conditions. The reforms also aim to guarantee access to coverage, renewal of existing plans, non-discrimination based on health status, and affordability through tax deductions. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) aimed to make health insurance more affordable by raising tax deductions for self-employed individuals, introducing Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) with high deductible plans, providing tax incentives for long-term care insurance, and implementing administrative simplification and privacy provisions. Additional federal protections were added post-HIPAA, including requirements for minimum hospital stays for newborn delivery, coverage for mental health services, and reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) aimed to help insured Americans with preexisting conditions and those who have been denied insurance due to their health status. It does not address the larger issue of the uninsured population. HIPAA provisions may encourage some uninsured, self-employed individuals to purchase coverage, but the cost of insurance for those eligible under HIPAA's group-to-individual portability provisions may be significantly higher, potentially discouraging them from buying insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) does not require employers to offer or pay for health insurance for their employees, family coverage, or cover part-time, seasonal, or temporary employees. However, employers sponsoring a group health plan must comply with certain requirements, including restrictions on preexisting condition limitations, non-discrimination based on health status, and documentation of creditable coverage. HIPAA's \"portability\" protection allows individuals to use evidence of prior coverage to reduce costs. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) allows individuals to use evidence of prior coverage to reduce or eliminate preexisting condition exclusion periods when switching health plans. Portability applies when moving between group health plans, from group to individual policies, or vice versa. Creditable coverage includes various types of insurance such as group health plans, individual health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, military health care, and more. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) allows individuals to use prior coverage to reduce or eliminate preexisting condition exclusion periods when switching health plans. Preexisting conditions are defined as physical or mental conditions for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the 6-month period before enrollment. Pregnancy is not considered a preexisting condition, and limits or exclusions cannot be imposed on newborns or newly adopted children if they are covered under creditable coverage within 30 days. Final regulations implementing the health coverage portability provisions of HIPAA require plans to bring specific benefit exclusions into compliance by July 1, 2005. These exclusions include coverage restrictions on pregnancy and injuries from accidents prior to enrollment. The Act also prohibits the use of genetic information as a preexisting condition, except in cases where there is a diagnosis of a related medical condition. Plans can exclude or restrict coverage of preexisting conditions for up to 12 months. Under the HIPAA Act, group health plans cannot impose more than a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period (18 months for late enrollees). Portability protection is provided for HIPAA-eligible individuals in the individual market. Group health plans must meet requirements related to portability, including limitations on preexisting conditions based on creditable coverage. Waiting periods cannot be applied to pregnancy, covered newborns, or adopted children under 18. The HIPAA Act prohibits group health plans from imposing more than a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period (18 months for late enrollees). Portability protection is provided for HIPAA-eligible individuals in the individual market, with requirements related to limitations on preexisting conditions based on creditable coverage. Waiting periods cannot be applied to pregnancy, covered newborns, or adopted children under 18. Employers may require a waiting period before individuals can participate in the health plan, but this should not be confused with a preexisting condition limitation period. Individuals should maintain continuous coverage to benefit from the Act's portability protection. The HIPAA Act prohibits group health plans from imposing more than a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period (18 months for late enrollees). Individuals should maintain continuous coverage to benefit from the Act's portability protection, which limits preexisting condition exclusions based on creditable coverage. Moving between group plans or from individual to group coverage can reduce preexisting condition limitation periods. Once a 12-month limitation period is met, no new limitation may ever be imposed as long as continuous coverage is maintained. Individuals must maintain continuous coverage to avoid preexisting condition exclusion periods under the HIPAA Act. Certifications documenting prior creditable coverage are required to establish eligibility for a waiver of limitations. Health plans and insurers must provide written certifications of coverage periods, including COBRA continuation provisions. The certification must be provided when coverage ends or upon request within 24 months. Interim rules issued by administering agencies offer guidance and model forms to streamline the certification process. Late enrollment in a group health plan occurs when an individual enrolls outside of the initial eligibility period or a special enrollment period. A waiting period may be imposed before coverage begins, but it must be applied uniformly regardless of health status. Waiting periods do not count towards breaks in coverage of 63 days or more. Plans can determine the length of waiting periods, but they cannot exclude coverage based on preexisting conditions. Plans can exclude coverage for preexisting health conditions for up to 12 months. Waiting periods before enrollment must run concurrently with the preexisting condition limitation period. If an individual had 7 or more months of creditable coverage, no limitation period can be imposed. New benefit packages may cover additional benefits not included in the prior plan. Plans have discretion in applying prior creditable coverage to new benefits. Issuers have two options for determining creditable coverage: including all periods from qualified sources or examining prior coverage on a benefit-specific basis. Categories like mental health, substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, dental care, and vision care can be considered separately. Plans can exclude certain benefits not covered in the prior plan for up to 12 months. Employers offering family coverage must extend the same protections to spouses and dependents. HIPAA guarantees coverage for spouses and dependents, prohibiting denial based on family members' health status. States can choose to enforce federal HIPAA guarantees or establish alternative mechanisms. Health insurance issuers in the individual market must offer coverage to all eligible individuals without limitations on preexisting conditions. Compliance with HIPAA can be achieved in three ways: offering coverage to all individual insurance policies, the two most popular policies, or a lower-level policy. HIPAA's portability rules require issuers in the individual market to offer coverage to eligible individuals without preexisting condition limitations. Eligible individuals must meet specific criteria, including having prior creditable health insurance coverage and no breaks in coverage of 63 days or more. Issuers can refuse coverage if financial or provider capacity would be impaired, but must apply this uniformly without regard to health status. Individuals who do not meet HIPAA's eligibility criteria are not protected by its portability and guaranteed availability provisions. These protections only apply to those whose most recent coverage was through traditional employer-based group plans, governmental plans, or church-sponsored plans. People with coverage from military, college-sponsored student plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and other specified plans are not eligible for these federal protections. State laws may offer protection to these individuals. An acceptable alternative state mechanism for coverage of eligible individuals must provide a choice of health insurance coverage to all eligible individuals without preexisting condition restrictions. It should include at least one policy form of coverage comparable to comprehensive health insurance offered in the state's individual market or a standard option under group or individual health insurance laws. States may implement mechanisms like NAIC Model Acts, high-risk pools, risk spreading approaches, financial subsidies, or other mechanisms to provide eligible individuals with a choice of available individual health insurance coverage. The Act's group-to-individual portability provisions are implemented differently by each state, with some utilizing high-risk pools or a combination of mechanisms. States may provide information on health insurance regulation through their department of insurance. Missouri is the only state not enforcing these standards itself, leading to CMS enforcement in the state. The Act provides two special enrollment periods for individuals losing group health insurance coverage to easily obtain other group coverage. Employees eligible but not enrolled must be allowed to join the plan if certain conditions are met, such as having previous coverage under a group health plan or COBRA continuation provision. Written statements may be required for declining enrollment. The special enrollment period allows individuals who have lost group health insurance coverage due to various reasons to enroll in a new plan within 30 days. This includes employees who had coverage terminated for reasons like legal separation, divorce, or termination of employment, as well as dependent beneficiaries who gain eligibility through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement of adoption. Individuals eligible for special enrollment, including spouses not previously enrolled, can enroll for coverage effective on the date of birth, adoption, or marriage. The Act prohibits group health plans from denying enrollment based on health status factors like medical history or disability. Plans cannot charge different premiums based on health status and must re-enroll participants regardless of health status. HIPAA's non-discrimination provision prohibits group health plans from denying enrollment based on health status factors. This includes individuals participating in high-risk activities. The protection extends to enrollment policies and premiums, but not to coverage of benefits. The Act does not require coverage for injuries from high-risk activities under a group health plan. Employers are not mandated to offer coverage to spouses or children, but if they do, non-discrimination protections apply. Premium amounts are not restricted, but plans cannot charge higher premiums based on health factors. Discounts for health programs are allowed, but plans cannot discriminate based on health status. The Act mandates insurers to accept small employers for coverage regardless of health status. Small employers are defined as having 2 to 50 employees. Guaranteed issue also applies to eligible individuals within the employer's group. Exceptions exist for network plans with capacity limits or if employees do not reside in the plan's area. Employers with over 50 employees are not covered by this requirement. The Act mandates insurers to accept small employers for coverage regardless of health status, defined as having 2 to 50 employees. Larger employer groups with over 50 employees are not protected by this requirement. Health insurance issuers did not typically consider health status when accepting larger employer groups for coverage. The Act requires reporting on access to health insurance in the large group market every three years. All health insurance issuers must provide guaranteed renewability for any group requesting renewal, with exceptions for non-payment of premiums or fraud. Insurers are not limited in the amounts they can charge. HIPAA initially did not require specific benefits, but Congress later added protections by mandating specific benefits. Congress has added to HIPAA's protections by mandating specific benefits for certain services, such as mental health \"parity\" and prohibiting limitations on hospital stays for newborn delivery. Private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses compared to other illnesses, with some states passing laws for full parity in treatment limitations and financial requirements. Several states have enacted laws requiring health plans to provide specific mental health benefits, but these laws have limited impact as they do not cover self-insured plans. The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 established federal standards for mental health coverage in employer-sponsored plans, focusing on parity for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage. However, insurers are not compelled to offer full-parity coverage. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) imposes restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing on mental health coverage. Employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt, and those experiencing a 1% increase in claims costs can apply for an exemption. Legislation to expand MHPA for full-parity coverage failed in Congress due to concerns about increased healthcare costs. The Act prohibits group health plans from limiting hospital stays for childbirth to less than 48 hours for normal deliveries and 96 hours for caesarian deliveries. Title IX of the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act requires coverage for mastectomies to also include prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery. Employers can exclude specific illnesses from health benefit plans, but many states have laws mandating certain benefits be included in insurance products. Small employers may have limited discretion in choosing coverage due to insurance company policies. ERISA allows self-funded plans to customize benefits, while HIPAA imposes specific coverage requirements on these plans. Dental-only policies can be exempt from the Act under certain conditions. Association plans must comply with Act requirements, such as not dropping groups based on medical services usage and adhering to preexisting condition limitations. The Act allows for creditable coverage, renewal of coverage, and overrides state laws on portability issues. States can impose their own requirements, but HIPAA ensures consumer protections are upheld. Exceptions to state laws include shorter preexisting condition periods and breaks in coverage longer than 62 days. The Act allows states to impose their own requirements on group health plans, but HIPAA ensures consumer protections are upheld. State laws on preexisting condition limitations can be overridden by the Act, with a 6-month limit allowed instead of 12 months. The FEHBP program falls under HIPAA's definition of a group health plan. The Act does not restrict premium amounts, but some states limit insurance premiums in the individual market. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury jointly enforce the Act's provisions. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury jointly enforce the provisions of the Act, with specific responsibilities for enforcing requirements on employer plans, group health plans, and health insurance issuers. States have primary responsibility for enforcing HIPAA's standards, but DHHS may step in if states do not comply. Noncomplying group health plans under ERISA may face penalties. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to enforce compliance with ERISA requirements, including imposing civil money penalties. Group health plans may be fined $100 per day per violation by the IRS for noncompliance. States enforce requirements on issuers, with the Secretary of HHS in Missouri imposing fines for violations. The Secretary of HHS can promulgate regulations for HIPAA's insurance provisions. COBRA continuation coverage is considered creditable coverage when transitioning between group policies. The Act clarifies that COBRA continuation coverage is considered creditable coverage when moving between group policies, allowing individuals to switch to a new health plan without waiting for coverage of preexisting conditions, as long as there is no lapse in coverage of 63 days or more. In the individual market, eligibility for guaranteed availability and portability requires exhausting COBRA or other continuation coverage first. Insurers in the individual market can charge rates allowed under state law, with no limit on premiums. The Act also makes changes to COBRA continuation coverage laws. The Act clarifies COBRA continuation coverage eligibility for disabled qualified beneficiaries and their family members, including an additional 11 months of coverage. It also includes provisions for newborn or adopted children of covered employees. COBRA can be terminated if a beneficiary becomes covered under a group health plan without exclusions. Individuals can use funds from their Medical Savings Account to pay COBRA premiums. HIPAA includes other health care provisions. HIPAA directed the Secretary of HHS to issue standards for electronic transmission of health care information between payers and providers, streamlining administrative operations in the health care system. The Act also required the development of security standards to protect health information from unauthorized access. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandated security standards to protect health information from unauthorized access. Compliance was required by April 21, 2005. HIPAA also called for unique health identifiers for patients, employers, health plans, and providers. While standards for employer and provider identifiers have been issued, the health plan identifier is still in development. Congress has prevented the development of a unique patient identifier standard since FY1999. Concerns over privacy of medical information have grown with the increased use of information technology in healthcare. Patients worry about unauthorized access to their medical records and potential misuse of their health information. HIPAA addressed concerns about the privacy of health information by setting a deadline for Congress to enact comprehensive legislation. When Congress failed to meet the deadline, the Secretary developed a health information privacy rule. The final rule was issued on December 28, 2000, with modifications published on August 14, 2002. For more information on the privacy rule, refer to CRS Report RS20500, Medical Records Privacy: Questions and Answers on the HIPAA Rule by [author name scrubbed].HIPAA also authorized tax-advantaged medical savings accounts (MSAs) under a demonstration that began in 1997. MSAs, formally known as Archer MSAs, are personal savings accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses. They can be used to pay for healthcare not covered by insurance, including deductibles and copayments. Taxpayers with qualifying high deductible insurance can establish MSAs if they are self-employed or covered by a high deductible plan from their small employer. Employer contributions are tax-free, while individual contributions are tax-deductible. MSAs are held by financial institutions, with tax-exempt earnings. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, while non-qualified distributions are subject to income tax and a 15% penalty. HIPAA set a deadline for establishing new accounts and limited total contributions. The IRS estimated 78,913 MSA returns filed for tax year 2001, with 20,592 new accounts established in the first six months of 2002. Amendments extended the deadline for new accounts to December 31, 2003. Current MSA owners can maintain their accounts and make contributions if they have qualifying high-deductible insurance. MSA owners can now have HSAs, and their MSA balances can be rolled over. For more information on MSAs and HSAs, refer to CRS reports. HIPAA increased the deduction for self-employed taxpayers' health insurance premiums from 30% to 100% starting in 2003. It also allowed for the deduction of long-term care insurance premiums. Payments for personal injury or sickness through certain insurance arrangements are exempt from taxation. HIPAA established new rules for the tax treatment of long-term care insurance and expenses, effective January 1, 1997. Qualified long-term care insurance benefits are excluded from gross income and employer contributions to premiums are also excluded. Unreimbursed long-term care expenses can be deducted if they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Long-term care insurance premiums can be counted as expenses subject to age-adjusted limits. Self-employed individuals can include these premiums in their deduction for health insurance expenses. Qualified long-term care insurance must meet specific criteria. Long-term care insurance requirements at the time the policy was issued are considered qualified insurance for favorable tax treatment. Qualified long-term care services include necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, and personal care services for chronically ill individuals. Services provided by a spouse or relative are not eligible for tax benefits unless provided by a licensed professional. Chronically ill individuals are defined as those unable to perform at least two activities of daily living without assistance for at least 90 days. HIPAA requires certification by a licensed health practitioner for individuals with disabilities or cognitive impairments needing substantial supervision for health and safety. Exclusions from gross income include accelerated death benefits and amounts from viatical settlements. Terminally ill individuals are certified by a physician as having an illness with a poor prognosis. The exclusion of accelerated death benefits is limited to the actual costs of long-term care incurred by chronically ill individuals. Contracts must not pay expenses reimbursable under Medicare. HIPAA added organizations exempt from federal income tax. HIPAA added state-sponsored membership organizations providing insurance to high-risk individuals and workmen's compensation reinsurance organizations to the list of tax-exempt entities. It also allowed certain health insurance providers to deduct expenses and claims, exempted IRA distributions for medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of income from early withdrawal penalties, and waived penalties for IRA distributions used to pay health insurance premiums after job loss with unemployment compensation. The Secretary of the Treasury included organ and tissue donor information in tax refunds from February 1, 1997 through June 30, 1997. Medical savings accounts (MSAs) were authorized under a demonstration starting in 1997."
