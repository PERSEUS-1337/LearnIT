    "content": "On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig experienced an uncontained release of hydrocarbons, causing explosions and fire, leading to 11 crew member fatalities. This incident resulted in the largest oil spill in U.S. waters, lasting approximately 84 days until responders gained control on July 15, 2010. The well ultimately released over 200 million gallons of crude oil. Satellite data showed decreasing daily quantities of oil on the ocean's surface after the spill. The government's GeoPlatform database reported no oil on the ocean's surface on August 20, 2010, the first day without observed oil since the spill began. Satellite analyses were discontinued on August 25, 2010, after several days of no oil sightings. Despite decreasing oil on the ocean surface post-well containment, oil was found in other areas, raising questions about its fate. The report focuses on assessing the oil's fate, separate from its impacts on Gulf ecosystems. Congressional interest and action may be influenced by perceptions of the oil's fate, which could be shaped by various factors, including assessment methods and biases. The fate of oil released into a marine environment is influenced by various factors, including the chemical composition of the oil, natural processes, spill location, and human intervention. The 2010 Gulf spill involved crude oil, a complex mixture of chemical compounds that react differently in the environment. Policymakers' perceptions of the oil's impact can affect attention to consequences and industry pressure. Monitoring oil spills and response performance is crucial for oversight and assessing government capabilities. The 2010 Gulf spill involved crude oil, a complex mixture of chemical compounds that react differently in the environment. Evaporation can remove about one-third of the volume of a medium crude oil slick within the first day of a release, but other components may persist longer. When oil enters a marine environment, natural processes alter its physical and chemical makeup, a process known as \"weathering.\" The altered materials are incorporated into natural systems over varying timeframes. The fate of oil released into the marine environment is influenced by various factors such as location, weather events, and water temperature. The 2010 Gulf spill, originating from a depth of 5,000 feet, presented unique challenges that affected the oil's fate. Severe weather events can transport oil to sensitive areas or impede response efforts. The 2010 Gulf spill, originating from a depth of 5,000 feet, introduced complications compared to surface oil spills. The oil well blowout discharged oil rapidly into the Gulf waters, leading to natural dispersion. Responders used mechanical removal, in situ burning, and chemical dispersants to address the spill. The use of mechanical removal, in situ burning, and chemical dispersants had different consequences for the fate of the oil spilled in the Gulf. In situ burning transfers some pollution risk to the air, while dispersants alter the physical properties of oil to minimize surface oil reaching shoreline habitats. The use of dispersants in the Gulf oil spill increased the hydrocarbon load in the water column while reducing it in coastal wetlands. Approximately 1.8 million gallons of dispersants were authorized, with 42% applied at the wellhead. Dispersant use stopped when the well was sealed, but the long-term impacts are unknown. The National Incident Command released an oil spill budget estimate on August 4, 2010. The Horizon incident received significant media attention and a press conference was held with key Administration personnel. Questions were raised about the August 4 oil budget estimates, leading to the release of a peer-reviewed \"Technical Document\" on November 23, 2010. This document explained how the estimates were derived and clarified that they were used for operational and response purposes, not to track the final fate of the spilled oil. The November 2010 oil budget estimates categorize oil into human intervention, natural processes, and other groups. Direct recovery from wellhead accounted for 17% of the total release, with 820,000 barrels captured. Responders burned 260,000 barrels (5% of total release) based on ASTM standards. Skimmed oil estimate was a rough calculation based on collected oil/water mixtures. The oil budget estimate for the spill is 160,000 barrels, with 770,000 barrels chemically dispersed using 1.8 million gallons of dispersants. The original estimate was conservative and now represents the low end of the range, with uncertainties in chemically dispersed oil being much larger than other categories. The Technical Document discusses challenges in estimating the effectiveness of dispersant operations for the oil spill. It estimates that 630,000 barrels of oil were naturally dispersed, defined as droplets smaller than 100 microns. Additionally, 1.2 million barrels of oil evaporated or dissolved. The uncertainty ranges for natural dispersion are not clearly specified in the data. The authors estimate that 1.2 million barrels of oil evaporated or dissolved, accounting for 24% of the total estimated release. Dissolution played a significant role due to the nature and depth of the spill. The remaining oil, categorized as \"other,\" amounts to 1.1 million barrels. The November Technical Document highlights uncertainties in estimating the fate of the oil spilled from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The estimates are based on formulas and assumptions, with the final mass balance calculation yet to be determined. The document includes uncertainty ranges for various categories, emphasizing the need for further studies to provide a more accurate assessment. The November Technical Document emphasizes uncertainties in estimating the fate of oil spilled from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The document includes uncertainty ranges for various categories, highlighting the need for further studies to provide a more accurate assessment. The remaining oil in the Gulf, over 100 million gallons, raises questions about its location and physical/chemical state. The debate over releasing estimates to the public due to uncertainty and potential misapplication is also discussed. The OSAT report from December 17, 2010, provides data on oil samples collected in the Gulf from May to October 2010. Despite efforts to prevent oil from reaching shorelines, around 1,100 miles were contaminated, decreasing to 481 miles by October 2011. This data sheds light on the fate of the oil spilled from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The comparison between oiling in October 2010 and October 2011 shows a decline in the total number of oiled shoreline miles, especially in the \"heavy\" category. However, a significant amount of oiled shoreline still remains compared to the previous year. The quantification of the oil in beached shoreline debris is crucial in determining its contribution to the overall oil content. Independent researchers initially reported potential underwater plumes of weathered oil near the spill source after the Deepwater Horizon incident, which was met with skepticism. A different research team confirmed evidence of an undersea plume linked to the Deepwater Horizon incident. Peer-reviewed papers documented subsea plumes, including one over 35 kilometers long at a depth of 3,300 feet. The Administration established a Joint Analysis Group (JAG) to coordinate subsea monitoring in the Gulf, which reported diminished dissolved oxygen levels as a proxy for subsurface dispersed oil. The OSAT report provided water column sampling results showing elevated PAH levels in June and July 2010, exceeding EPA benchmarks by a factor of 10. Samples after August 3, 2010, did not exceed PAH benchmarks. The report lacks pre-spill data but offers limited insights on the fate of the oil. Some oil from the 2010 Gulf spill may have settled on the ocean floor, as indicated by sediment samples showing an oil layer on top sediment. Researchers could not definitively link the oil to the spill, but initial observations suggest it is not from natural seeps. The November Technical Document discounts the claim of extensive oil on the Gulf bottom from Deepwater Horizon, stating ongoing sampling programs have not confirmed it. OSAT sampling suggests some oil may have settled in various sea floor locations, with nearshore sediment samples showing elevated PAH levels in early weeks of the spill. Sampling concluded in October with all sediment samples below pre-spill reference levels, indicating pre-impact average concentrations had been reached. The OSAT report identified oil in nearshore locations where \"tar mat formations\" had been previously observed by SCAT teams. A sampling data gap was noted in waters less than 10 feet deep, prompting further evaluation by a specific OSAT team. Offshore samples collected between August and October did not show elevated PAH concentrations, with most samples at or below pre-spill levels. Deepwater sediment samples within three kilometers of the wellhead had the highest percentage exceeding PAH benchmarks, likely influenced by microbial organisms. Natural oil seeps in the Gulf may have also played a role in the fate of the oil. The Gulf of Mexico has natural oil seeps that release large volumes of oil each year, supporting oil-eating bacteria. Studies have shown that these organisms played a role in the Gulf spill, with some questioning their impact. Research from Woods Hole suggested that the subsurface plume persisted without substantial biodegradation, while a paper from Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory presented different findings. The Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory documented results showing hydrocarbon-degrading populations in the deep-sea plume, suggesting potential for bioremediation of oil contaminants. Another study from Woods Hole found that microbes digested oil at an unprecedented rate in surface waters during the spill. The fate of the remaining oil from the Macondo well in the Gulf environment remains unknown. Challenges such as the complexity of the Gulf system, resources needed for data collection, and varied interpretations hinder efforts to determine the oil's fate conclusively. Researchers are studying damages to natural resources in the Gulf, which may provide clues over time. Efforts are being made to study damages to natural resources in the Gulf, which could offer clues about the fate of the oil."
