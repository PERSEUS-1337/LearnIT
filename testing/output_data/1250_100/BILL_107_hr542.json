The Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 aims to enhance small businesses' participation in the federal regulatory process by clarifying and strengthening the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process and expanding the number of federal agencies required to convene such panels. SEC. 3. Ensuring full analysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules proposed by certain agencies. Section 609(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require covered agencies to notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration before publishing an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. This includes providing information on potential impacts on small entities and seeking advice from identified small entity representatives. The draft proposed rule requires covered agencies to convene a review panel consisting of federal employees, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Chief Counsel. The panel reviews agency materials, collects advice from small entity representatives, and allows for oral presentations. The covered agency must complete this process within 60 days. The review panel convened by covered agencies must report to the agency head within 60 days on comments from small entity representatives and findings on specific issues. The agency head must publish the panel's report in the Federal Register within 120 days or as part of the proposed rulemaking notice. The agency should make modifications to the proposed rule or regulatory analysis as needed. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\nSection 609(d) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to define 'covered agency' as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor, and the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury, and 'small entity representative' as a small entity or an individual/organization representing a small entity.\n\nSEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act will be effective after a 90-day period from its enactment."
