The Congress finds that free trade agreements benefit citizens by improving income and prosperity, APEC aims for free and open trade by 2020, economic growth in the Pacific Rim is crucial for the US, and the Asian financial crisis is a concern. The financial crisis in Asia has disrupted US export growth, leading to pressure for protectionist policies. Free trade agreements with allies like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore aim to open markets for US goods and services, benefiting economic growth. Coordination with friendly countries will be crucial for trade liberalization in the next century. In the next century, the United States must continue promoting its interests in the Asia-Pacific region through aggressive trade and investment negotiations. Bilateral trade agreements can positively influence multilateral and regional trade talks by expanding common areas of agreement on trade disciplines. Resolving trade disputes with Pacific Rim countries through mutually agreed-upon disciplines and dispute settlement mechanisms is more effective than issue-by-issue confrontations. Free trade agreements can provide a solid foundation for enhanced cooperation between the United States and its trading partners. Free trade agreements between the United States and Pacific Rim countries will enhance market access and help stabilize the bilateral trade balance, ensuring mutually beneficial economic and political relations. The United States will implement trade policy with eligible Pacific Rim countries. The United States aims to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries. Nontariff barriers include regulatory obstacles, lack of intellectual property protection, discriminatory standards, and unfair trade practices. The President will identify eligible Pacific Rim countries and initiate consultations within 60 days of the Act's enactment. If feasible, a ministerial meeting will be requested within 60 days to discuss conditions for formal trade negotiations. The International Trade Commission will advise the President on the economic effects of providing duty-free treatment to products from these countries. The Ministerial Meeting Recommendations will be discussed within 60 days of the Act's enactment to consider conditions for formal trade negotiations with eligible Pacific Rim countries. The President recommends establishing a council of public and private sector officials to review aspects of the bilateral relationship for a free trade agreement. The council analyzes trade practices, customs laws, economic data, disputes, and issues a report within 6 months. The President suggests creating a council to review trade practices and customs laws for a free trade agreement, including dispute settlement mechanisms for resolving bilateral trade issues effectively. The President proposes establishing a council to assess the feasibility and desirability of negotiating free trade agreements with eligible countries. The President, after receiving advice, shall determine the feasibility of negotiating a free trade agreement with a Pacific Rim country and submit a report to the Senate and House committees. Factors considered include WTO membership and expressed interest in bilateral negotiations. The country has shown interest in negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States, pursued trade liberalization and economic reforms, aligned with US trade policy objectives, actively participated in WTO preparations, and is working to eliminate export requirements. The country seeks harmonization of standards, increases economic opportunities for small- and medium-sized businesses, eliminates trade barriers, provides national treatment for foreign investment, accommodates US market access objectives, resolves trade disputes with the US, benefits from improved dispute settlement mechanisms, and enhances the market for US products and services by eliminating trade barriers. The President must consult regularly with specific congressional committees regarding the implementation of the Act. The Act defines eligible Pacific Rim countries as those that are WTO members and members of APEC."
