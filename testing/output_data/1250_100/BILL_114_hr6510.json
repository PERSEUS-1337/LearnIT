    "content": "The \"Save the Children Act of 2016\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress expresses its sense through this act. Congress expresses its sense that thousands of Syrian children are in a humanitarian crisis due to the civil war, and the US should facilitate the relocation of up to 25,000 young Syrian minor children refugees over three years. The US should facilitate family reunification or safe relocation of young Syrian child refugees to Syria after a reduction in civil war violence and displaced inhabitants. SEC. 3. SAVE THE CHILDREN PROGRAM. The Save the Children Program aims to grant visas to young minor children from Syria aged three to ten to enter and stay in the US until there is a significant reduction in civil war violence and displaced inhabitants in Syria. The program allows for a six-month grace period after the designated time by the Department of State for proper guardianship identification. Only children with established guardians present or proven orphaned are eligible for the visa. An Office of Coordination is established within the Office of Refugee. The Coordinator of the Save the Children Program in the Office of Refugee Resettlement has supervisory authority over its operations in the United States. The Coordinator appoints additional personnel with approval from the Office of Personnel Management. The Coordinator of the Save the Children Program may request personnel from federal departments to assist in carrying out duties. The Coordinator is responsible for identifying qualifying young minor children for the Program and implementing their temporary resettlement in the United States. The Coordinator of the Save the Children Program works with nongovernmental organizations and government authorities to implement the Program and assist children admitted under it. They consult with relevant government officials to ensure operations are in line with laws, international agreements, and national security interests. The Program aims to reunite families in the United States within six months after a significant reduction in civil war violence and displacement in Syria. The Program will end six months after the Secretary of State certifies the reduction in violence and displacement. The Program, in coordination with various government departments, aims to reunite minor children admitted to the United States with their parents or caretakers as required by international agreements and US laws. The Program may be suspended or terminated based on the President's determination for foreign policy and domestic security interests. Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year, and reporting requirements must be met within 180 days. The Coordinator must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of the Act detailing the implementation of the Program. SEC. 4. TEMPORARY NONIMMIGRANT VISA. The Program shall admit up to 5,000 alien minor children aged three to ten in the first year, and 10,000 more in each of the following two years. Preference will be given to children already in US or ally custody outside Syria. An amendment allows for a temporary nonimmigrant visa until the Secretary of State certifies a reduction in civil war violence and displaced Syria inhabitants. Alien children aged three to ten, residing in Syria or born in Syria but currently displaced, can be approved to temporarily reside in the United States under the Save the Children Program. They can remain in the US until the Secretary of State certifies a reduction in civil war violence in Syria. The Secretary of State must certify a sustained reduction in civil war violence in Syria and a decrease in newly displaced Syrian inhabitants before alien children aged three to ten can be approved to temporarily reside in the United States under the Save the Children Program."
