    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the Truth in Employment Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The tactic of \"salting\" by union organizers has evolved into aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of collective bargaining rights. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm. Employers should not discriminate based on employees' views on collective bargaining, but should have the right to expect job performance. Employers should expect job applicants to be interested in utilizing their skills to further the employer's business goals. The purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and alleviate pressure on employers from disruptive individuals. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. Amends Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals seeking employment primarily to further another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants under the Act. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accurate analysis. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to determine single location bargaining unit appropriateness. A blanket rule limiting factors considered detracts from promoting stability in labor relations.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n    This title aims to ensure the National Labor Relations Board conducts a specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit based on all relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nSEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. SEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to require a hearing to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of an employer if there is no agreement between parties. Factors considered include functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions from the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field. Therefore, this title aims to award fees and costs to small entities when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board to ensure they are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions brought by the Board. The purpose of this title is to award fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board, aiming to reduce disparities in resources and expertise and hold the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. SEC. 302 amends the National Labor Relations Act to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 outlines the conditions under which an employer or labor organization with specific size and financial criteria can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in administrative and court proceedings under certain circumstances. Employers or labor organizations with less than 100 employees and a net worth under $1,400,000 at the time of filing a civil action can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party under section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code, without needing justification from the United States. Appeals regarding fee determinations will also not consider the justification of the United States. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act applies to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of this Act."
