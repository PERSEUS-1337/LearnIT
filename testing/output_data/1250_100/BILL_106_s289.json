This part of the Act applies to programs providing Federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It excludes awards for other purposes. Definitions include 'designated award recipient' and 'designated direct award'. The Act applies to programs providing Federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. Definitions include terms like 'designated subaward', 'designated program', 'financial assistance', 'program beneficiary', 'program participant', 'program services', and 'religious organization'. The curr_chunk defines terms related to voucherized assistance in a program, including the definition of a religious organization as a nonprofit entity. Voucherized assistance involves selecting and reimbursing program services through a document given to the beneficiary, who then chooses the service provider according to specified rules. The selected organization is then reimbursed for the services provided. The curr_chunk describes program services where the beneficiary chooses a service provider to allocate program funds. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term \"program participant\" includes entities that receive direct awards or subawards, even if they only provide services through voucherized assistance. Religious organizations can participate in program services with voucherized assistance without compromising their religious character or freedom. The establishment clause does not require discrimination against faith-based providers or force them to abandon their religious identity to receive federal program funding. Religious organizations participating in program services can maintain their independence and religious character. They are not required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols to receive funding. Religious organizations participating in program services can require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs and practices, as well as rules on drug and alcohol use. This does not affect discrimination laws. Program beneficiaries can object to religious organizations, but if the organization received direct funding, they must make alternative arrangements. Religious organizations can require employees to adhere to their beliefs and rules on drug and alcohol use. Program beneficiaries can object to this, but if the organization received direct funding, they must arrange for individuals to receive program services through an alternative entity with equal value. Religious organizations participating in programs cannot discriminate based on religion but may require beneficiaries to engage in religious practices and follow religious rules. Additionally, these organizations must adhere to fiscal accountability measures. Religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance must comply with auditing regulations. If they keep federal funds separate, only those funds are subject to audit. Organizations can seek judicial review of agency actions for compliance with these regulations. SEC. 583 prohibits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is redeemed. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of programs and treatment of funds. SEC. 584 outlines that financial assistance in a designated program is aid to the beneficiary, not the organization providing services. It also prohibits state discrimination in using funds in religious facilities. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder services. States must recognize religious education for personnel in program services. The text chunk discusses the establishment of formal educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing drug treatment services, with an exception for religious organizations with a successful track record in drug treatment. The text chunk discusses the waiver of educational qualifications for personnel in drug treatment programs if the organization has a successful track record and the government fails to prove the necessity of these qualifications."
