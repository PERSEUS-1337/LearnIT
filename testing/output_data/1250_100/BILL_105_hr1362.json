    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medicare Reimbursement Demonstration Act of 1997\" establishes a demonstration project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project starting in 1998. The project involves reimbursing the Department of Veterans Affairs for healthcare services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to waive certain Medicare requirements for this project. Selected facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs will participate in providing these services. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The selection plan will prioritize facilities capable of serving targeted Medicare-eligible veterans with high demand and billing capability. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate facilities in geographic service areas for a demonstration project. Facilities must have billing capability, quality care indicators, and meet relevant factors. At least one facility near a closed military medical base will be selected. Participation by targeted Medicare-eligible veterans is voluntary, based on facility capacity and funding. The Secretary will establish cost-sharing requirements for veterans in the demonstration project, mirroring those for targeted Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services under a demonstration project at 95 percent of regular Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services under a demonstration project at 95 percent of regular Medicare payment rates, with an annual limit of $50,000,000. Payment amounts may be reduced if the Department of Veterans Affairs fails to maintain a certain level of effort in providing medical services for targeted veterans. The maintenance of effort level for any fiscal year is determined based on the preceding fiscal year's level or the amount of VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans in fiscal year 1997. It is adjusted based on the percentage difference in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the previous year, and any decrease in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans. The VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are defined as the amount spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a fiscal year for providing medical care to targeted veterans. This includes factors such as the rate of increase in medical care appropriations and the impact of changes in service delivery priorities for medicare-eligible veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs defines VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans as the amount spent in a fiscal year for hospital care and medical services under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. This excludes expenditures for medical examinations for claims adjudication and services reimbursed under a demonstration project. The Secretaries, in consultation with the Comptroller General, monitor the impact on Medicare program costs for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project period. The Comptroller General audits the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Medicare program annually during a demonstration project. If expenditures increase due to the project, steps are taken to recoup the amount and prevent further increases. To prevent future increases in expenditures, steps may include the Secretary paying the increased amount from the current medical care appropriation to the medicare trust funds and suspending or terminating the demonstration project or adjusting the percentage under subsection (a)(1). SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. An independent entity evaluates the health services demonstration project annually. Reports are submitted to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year, assessing costs, quality of care compliance, and program participation costs. The Secretaries are required to submit a report to Congress regarding the health services demonstration project, including recommendations on extending or making it permanent, expanding to cover more sites, and adjusting reimbursement amounts. The report should also address savings or costs to the Medicare programs, changes in access to care or quality of care for participating veterans, and the project's impact on access to care for non-participating veterans. The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress by March 1, 1999, regarding a new demonstration project for reimbursing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The terms defined in this Act include \"demonstration project,\" \"geographic service area,\" \"Medicare program,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting jointly. A \"targeted medicare-eligible veteran\" is a veteran entitled to Medicare benefits, with income between specified thresholds."
