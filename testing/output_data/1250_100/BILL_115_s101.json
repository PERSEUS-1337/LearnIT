The term \"Wilderness\" specifically denotes the Izembek Wilderness designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE REQUIRED. The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land for the purpose of designating a road corridor and constructing a gravel road. The value of the exchanged lands must be equal as determined by appraisals. The appraiser selected must conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with recognized standards. If the Federal land value exceeds the non-Federal land value, equalization can be achieved by conveying additional non-Federal land or making a cash payment to the State. The land exchange process allows for equalization of land values through cash payments or adjusting acreage. The Secretary can accept payments exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. Upon completion, the Wilderness boundary will be modified. The Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and include non-Federal land, which will be administered according to the Wilderness Act and other laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road construction will adhere to specified regulations. The land exchange and road construction under this Act will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act."
