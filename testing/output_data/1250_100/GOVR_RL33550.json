    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports. Relief is provided through additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury from imports, and the International Trade Administration must confirm subsidies. In a 2007 investigation on Chinese paper imports, the ITA changed its stance on applying CVD laws to nonmarket economy countries like China. In 2007, the ITA determined that subsidies in China could be identified due to market principles in many industries. China was reaffirmed as a nonmarket economy country. The ITA is responsible for designating countries as nonmarket economies based on various criteria. The ITA-designated NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. China, designated as an NME country in 1983, is a significant trading partner of the United States with a large trade deficit. Concerns have been raised about Chinese imports impacting U.S. industries and workers, leading to calls for increased use of trade remedy laws against Chinese products. China has been accused of using illegal subsidy programs to boost its industries and exports. The US has imposed over 80 antidumping duty orders on Chinese imports, citing undervalued currency as a factor contributing to the trade deficit and harming US production and employment in various sectors. The US has imposed antidumping duty orders on Chinese imports due to alleged currency manipulation and illegal subsidy programs. Legislation has been proposed to address currency misalignment issues with China, with the ITA determining China as a nonmarket economy country. The ITA had not taken countervailing action against China since 1991, until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. China's NME designation can only be used for a limited time, as per its WTO accession package. The US and other WTO members can no longer use nonmarket economy methodology for CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. The US had two countervailing duty laws in force during the 1983-1984 investigations. The countervailing duty laws in the US required determination of subsidization and injury to domestic industries. Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in 1995, levied duties on subsidized imports from countries not \"under the Agreement.\" The law defined subsidization as any form of grant or bounty. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 broadened countervailing legislation to include provisions from the international Subsidies and Countervailing Code. This U.S. law required a determination of subsidization and injury to domestic industries, with duties imposed on subsidized imports causing harm to U.S. industries. The URAA repealed section 303 and amended the countervailing duty law of the 1979 Act. It incorporated provisions similar to section 303, requiring injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries not under the Subsidies Agreement. Investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated based on petitions alleging public benefits provided to manufacturers in those countries. The petitions for countervailing action alleged that \"bounties or grants\" were provided in both Czechoslovakia and Poland through various programs. Both countries were found to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and were considered nonmarket economy (NME) countries. The investigations proceeded in parallel with identical determinations on common issues, with minor country-specific differences. The investigations into countervailing duties on imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland, both nonmarket economy countries, raised the question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to NME countries. The issue was addressed in preliminary determinations for carbon steel wire rod cases, where it was found that NME countries are not exempt from the law. The ITA considered the effects of government intervention in market vs. nonmarket economies but was inclined to not exclude nonmarket economies from the law. The ITA, in a market and nonmarket economy, was disposed to not exclude nonmarket economies from its application without further review. It focused on prices as key elements of subsidization, noting that in nonmarket economies, central planners set prices without regard to economic value. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy and if the conclusion would differ for a nonmarket economy. The ITA preliminarily concluded that various programs in nonmarket economies did not constitute bounties or grants under the CVD law. Despite not exempting NME countries, the alleged practices in Czechoslovakia and Poland were found not to provide bounties or grants. The investigations continued into the final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. The ITA found that Congress never directly addressed whether the countervailing duty law applies to nonmarket economy countries. Despite provisions for injurious imports from State-controlled-economy or Communist countries, Congress did not legislate on countervailing action in 1974 or 1979. The ITA found that Congress recognized the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries due to ineffective traditional trade remedies. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address the application of the CVD law to NME countries, but GATT signatories were permitted to regulate imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The ITA concluded that it is difficult to identify and quantify subsidies in nonmarket economy (NME) countries. They stated that the countervailing duty law does not apply to NMEs as there is no market reference point to determine subsidies. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland were NMEs due to their nonmarket cost or pricing structures. Manufacturers in these countries were found not to be subsidizing according to the ITA. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Investigations on potassium chloride imports from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union were initiated but later rescinded due to findings in other cases. No further countervailing investigations on allegedly subsidized imports from NME countries were initiated, except for one specialized exception in 1991. Based on a petition filed on October 1, 1991, the ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China. The petitioner claimed that the Chinese fan industry operated substantially based on market principles, allowing for objective investigation. In its investigation, the ITA found that prices of key inputs in the PC fans industry were not market-determined, leading to the industry not being considered an MOI. The CVD law could not be applied, resulting in a final negative determination. Petitioners challenged the ITA's decisions in court, which ruled that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies due to potential governmental subsidies. The CIT reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for determinations consistent with the court's opinion. It set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The CIT addressed the grounds on which the ITA based its determination of nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries, emphasizing that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies according to the CVD law. The CIT reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for determinations consistent with the court's opinion. It set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The CIT emphasized that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies according to the CVD law, rejecting the ITA's attempt to exempt countries with nonmarket economies from countervailing procedures. The ITA's redefinition of \"subsidy\" was seen as an attempt to amend the CVD law, which the court deemed illogical and contradictory. The CIT stated that the difficulties with the CVD law lie in measurement, an area within the expertise of the agency, which must investigate deviations regardless of the form of the economy. The CIT rejected the ITA's argument that subsidies cannot exist in nonmarket economies, emphasizing that the CVD law applies regardless of the form of the economy. The court dismissed the ITA's attempt to exempt nonmarket economies from countervailing procedures and stated that the agency must investigate deviations in subsidy practices. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws and concluded that the countervailing duty statute had remained substantially unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to undefined terms in the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the countervailing duty statute and found that it had not excluded nonmarket economies. The court determined that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports did not violate the CVD law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed countervailing duty laws, finding that subsidies from the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports were not in violation. The court's decision led to immediate congressional reaction, with H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress proposing the application of countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries. The proposed statute in H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress included procedural provisions for injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were introduced but not further considered. In the 103rd Congress, the Trade Enforcement Act of 1993 expanded countervailable subsidy definitions to NME countries. In the 104th to 109th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to non-market economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to NME countries, including China, for investigations of subsidies and foreign exchange-rate manipulation. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to NME countries, including China, for investigations of subsidies and foreign exchange-rate manipulation. In the 111th Congress, several bills sought to specifically apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies, regardless of ownership or subsidy type. The bills introduced in Congress aim to address subsidies in nonmarket economy countries like China. They prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping proceedings and provide a China-specific methodology for calculating subsidies. Administrative authorities are directed to use appropriate benchmarks when determining subsidy amounts in China. The bills introduced in Congress aim to address subsidies in nonmarket economy countries like China. Authorities are directed to use terms and conditions prevailing in China to calculate subsidies, but if not practicable, they can use terms outside of China. If China is deemed an NME country, authorities must presume special difficulties exist and use external terms and conditions to calculate subsidies. The bills also propose that a country's NME status can only be revoked with a joint resolution of Congress. The Bush Administration took steps in 2006 to address China's alleged subsidies. In late 2006, the Bush Administration initiated steps to address China's alleged subsidies. The ITA conducted a CVD investigation on a product from China and consultations were started in the WTO on China's subsidy regime. The ITC preliminarily determined that a U.S. domestic industry was threatened by subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35% in the CVD investigation. The ITA made a final determination that countervailable subsidies are provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's status as a non-market economy, the ITA noted significant differences in China's present-day economy compared to Soviet-style economies. The state plays a significant role in China's economy, controlling investment decisions, money and credit allocation, wage bills, and access to foreign currency. Private ownership is limited to consumer goods, with market forces determining prices. The ITA determined that market forces determine prices for over 90% of products in China, with wages negotiated and private ownership rights acknowledged by the government. Despite China being a non-market economy, the government has reduced its role in some areas while retaining control over the economy. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in investigations on CFS paper due to limited production capacity in China and Indonesia, no potential for product shifting, and lack of significant price effects from imports. Based on the evidence of price effects from imports, moderate inventories, and absence of negative effects on the domestic industry, it was concluded that the domestic CFSP industry is not threatened by imports from China and Indonesia. The investigation was terminated with refunds issued, and although subsidies were measured in China, no countervailing duties were imposed. In late July 2008, the first CVD order was placed on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed suit to prevent the CVD investigation, but the Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the US on preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. The U.S. Trade Representative requested public comments on a dispute with China over illegal subsidies. China has been active in using AD investigations against products from the U.S. and initiated its first CVD case in 2009. The U.S. requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China in 2007. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs in response to the U.S. request. The USTR raised concerns about Chinese subsidies benefiting domestic businesses over foreign ones, leading to trade distortions. China agreed to end disputed subsidies by January 1, 2008, as per WTO rules. By 2010, the USTR confirmed China had eliminated the subsidies. In December 2009, a settlement agreement was reached with China regarding export-contingent benefits. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, Congress may consider legislation to address unfair trade practices. This decision does not impact China's nonmarket economy status or subsidies in other NME countries. Legislation may need to ensure that CVD laws apply to other NME countries like Vietnam. There are no significant trade disputes with other NME countries currently. Specific factors for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies are lacking. AD duties are generally higher than countervailing duties. AD duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries tend to be higher due to the third-country data methodology. If China retains its NME status and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise with existing AD duties, some duties may need to be revised to avoid double counting. This could result in an overall reduction in protection provided, as noted by the Government Accountability Office. Some U.S. industries may find relief through CVD procedures for manipulation, expanding options beyond the AD statute."
