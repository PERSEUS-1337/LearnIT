    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989, ensuring a transitional increase amount is added to their primary insurance amount. The Social Security Act amendments provide transitional increase amounts for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1979 and 1988, with varying percentages based on the year of eligibility. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the recalculated amount without certain provisions. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' refers to the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under specific conditions outlined in the Social Security Act amendments. This calculation excludes certain provisions and bases the computation on criteria from December 1978. The paragraph discusses the application of specific provisions in calculating an individual's primary insurance amount under the Social Security Act amendments. It ensures that the amount is greater than if computed without considering these provisions. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE AND RELATED RULES. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 based on specific criteria. The Commissioner of Social Security will recalculate the primary insurance amount to reflect the amendments made by this Act, effective as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977 with no benefit increases before January 2007."
