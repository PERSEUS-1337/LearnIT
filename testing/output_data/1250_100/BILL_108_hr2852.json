    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to cord blood stem cells. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution for various diseases. Cord blood, normally discarded after childbirth, contains stem cells that can be collected without risk to the donor and preserved for transplantation or research purposes. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications. Matching unrelated donors increases success rates, especially for ethnic minorities who struggle to find fully matched donors. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity for donors, leading to quicker identification of fully or partially matched transplant units. This reduces the risk of complications like graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplants. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units can provide appropriate matches for 90% of those seeking transplants within days. Matching donors from the same ethnic background increases the likelihood of success. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, a genetic condition more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, have a high risk of severe infections and painful crises. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has shown promising results in curing the disease, especially when done early in the course of severe illness. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients due to less stringent matching requirements compared to bone marrow. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank could provide suitable matches for 90% of African American patients with conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia. The National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants since 1987, with cord blood transplantation complementing conventional methods, especially for non-caucasoid patients. Recent scientific developments suggest that further research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases and improve therapies for debilitating conditions like Parkinson's disease and diabetes. This research could potentially result in cures for such diseases. Chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer contribute significantly to disabilities and healthcare costs in the US. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes definitions for terms like Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, human cord blood stem cells, and National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The Secretary will contract with qualified cord blood stem cell banks to establish a National Network of Cord Blood Stem Cell Banks with at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of the donor banks in the Network is to acquire, test, store donated cord blood units for transplantation, and allocate 10% of inventory for research. A cord blood stem cell bank must have necessary licenses, implement donor screening practices, ensure confidentiality, and comply with regulations to be eligible as a donor bank. The Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 outlines requirements for cord blood stem cell banks, including encouraging donation from diverse donors, establishing communication systems with other banks and transplant centers, tracking recipients' outcomes, and educating the public about the benefits of cord blood stem cells. The Secretary will establish a Board of Directors to administer the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, which includes creating a national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinating donor banks. Board members will serve 3-year terms and represent cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians from birthing hospitals, and the cord blood stem cell community. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from the cord blood stem cell research community, transplant recipients, family members of patients, social science experts, the general public, the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation, and network donor banks. Members serve up to two consecutive 3-year terms. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes representatives from various backgrounds and serves up to two consecutive 3-year terms. To ensure continuity, approximately 1/3 of the Board members' terms expire each year, and a member can continue to serve until a successor is appointed. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry to identify, acquire, and distribute donated units of cord blood for candidate patients. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network aims to provide transplant physicians with a website to search for suitable donor matches and maintain a database to track cord blood units' collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes. The database must adhere to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality as per regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Administrator will use the database to report on network activities. The Administrator will report to the Secretary on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's activities. The Board of Directors will ensure donor banks meet requirements and that collection sites are distributed throughout the US. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006-2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
