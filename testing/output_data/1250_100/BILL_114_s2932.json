    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2016\". The Congress recognizes the importance of controlled substances in emergency medical services for saving lives and improving health outcomes. There is a need for regulatory oversight to prevent diversion of these substances in all healthcare settings. Regulatory oversight in healthcare settings, including emergency medical services, should be tailored to unique care delivery models and promote uniformity to prevent diversion of controlled substances. This oversight should also establish clear guidelines for various types of emergency medical services agencies. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act adds regulations for emergency medical services. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act defines key terms related to emergency medical services, including emergency medical services, emergency medical services agency, and emergency medical services practitioner. The Controlled Substances Act defines terms related to emergency medical services, such as medical director, medical oversight, standing order, verbal order, and online medical direction. The Controlled Substances Act allows emergency medical services agencies to register under the Attorney General to dispense controlled substances to patients in need of emergency medical services. This registration is done at the agency level, rather than individually for practitioners or medical directors, with a single registration required per State. The Attorney General requires a single registration per State for emergency medical services agencies to dispense controlled substances. Guidance is tailored to recognize existing medical care delivery models. Each agency must have one or more licensed medical directors for oversight. The medical director, licensed by the State, has responsibilities including decisions on patient transportation, approving medical protocols, and overseeing patient care by EMS practitioners. This includes evaluation, treatment, online medical direction, and drug establishment. The medical director oversees drug formularies, medication dispensing, medical education programs, quality improvement, and administration of controlled substances by EMS practitioners under standing orders. The medical director can issue standing orders or online medical directions that include verbal orders for specific patients or mass casualty incidents. The medical director can issue standing orders for specific patient situations to ensure proper care and treatment. The medical directors of the emergency medical services agency are not required to be present or provide a written prescription when administering a controlled substance. The agency must keep the standing order on file and provide it to the Attorney General upon request. The registrant emergency medical services agency must have a policy for documenting verbal orders and controlled substance administration. Controlled substances can only be received at designated agency locations. Movement and delivery of controlled substances are regulated. The registrant emergency medical services agency is allowed to move, deliver, and store controlled substances at designated locations. They are not considered distributors of controlled substances for these actions. This section does not affect requirements under the Social Security Act or limit the Attorney General's authority to enforce diversion of controlled substances."
