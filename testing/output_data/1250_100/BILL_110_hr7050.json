The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a successful Federal program that provided work and vocational training for unemployed young Americans to develop and conserve natural resources. Projects included environmental clean up, erosion control, reforestation, and disaster response, contributing to the modern national and State park systems. Today, a significant number of young adults are neither employed nor in school. High school dropouts face high incarceration risk, with 16% of young men aged 18-24 without a diploma or GED being incarcerated or on parole. The cost of incarceration is $40 billion annually. Dropouts cost the nation over $260 billion in lost wages and productivity. Energy inefficiencies contribute to 50% of US energy use, but efficiency gains could reduce electricity use by 70%. Estimates show that low-income households spend a higher percentage of their earnings on energy compared to the average household. Disconnected youth can be mobilized to improve energy efficiency in residential and public facilities, benefiting both the youth and the environment. Service and conservation corps provide educational and training opportunities for disconnected youth through national and community service projects. The Energy Conservation Corps aims to engage disadvantaged youth in energy conservation projects, promoting environmental stewardship and community service. It is established within the Department of Energy for individuals aged 16-25, with at least 50% from disadvantaged backgrounds, without regard to civil service. The Energy Conservation Corps allows individuals aged 16-25 to enroll for up to 24 months, providing opportunities for education and job training. Projects focus on increasing energy efficiency and natural resource use. Eligible applicants include service and conservation corps, nonprofit organizations, and government entities. The Energy Conservation Corps aims to support Corpsmembers in obtaining education, job training, and employment opportunities. The Secretary may set a cost per member based on the needs of disconnected young people. Flexibility is provided to grantees in recruitment and retention efforts. Alternative success measurement methods are also considered. The Energy Conservation Corps provides training and technical assistance to Corpsmembers, aged 16-25, with a preference for disadvantaged youth. Projects related to energy and resource conservation are eligible for funding. The Energy Conservation Corps focuses on service projects related to energy and resource conservation, including building, retrofitting, weatherizing facilities, conducting energy assessments, providing education and training on energy efficiency, installing renewable energy improvements, and building alternative transportation routes. Preference is given to projects that provide development and training for young individuals in energy efficiency career fields. The Energy Conservation Corps focuses on service projects related to energy efficiency, instilling work ethic and public service, being labor-intensive, prompt initiation, and providing educational opportunities. Projects must be consistent with relevant laws and policies, and nondisplacement requirements apply. The Secretary can accept donations for the projects. The Energy Conservation Corps can accept donations for operating and service projects. Definitions include disadvantaged youth, disconnected youth, and qualified service and conservation corps. The \"qualified service and conservation corps\" program offers full-time work for individuals aged 16-25 in infrastructure, housing, or transportation. Participants gain work experience, skills, education, and citizenship values. The Secretary of Energy is responsible for overseeing this program, with $100,000,000 authorized annually from 2009 to 2013."
