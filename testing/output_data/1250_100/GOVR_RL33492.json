Congress passed a transportation appropriations act providing Amtrak with $1.565 billion for FY2010. The legislation also allocated $2.5 billion for high-speed rail projects and required Amtrak to implement procedures for transporting firearms in checked baggage. Interim CEO Joseph Boardman's appointment was extended indefinitely in December 2009. In March 2009, Joseph Boardman was chosen to succeed Alexander Kummant as the CEO of Amtrak. Congress passed the FY2009 transportation appropriation act, providing $1.490 billion for Amtrak, along with additional funding for capital grants and intercity passenger rail infrastructure. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized nearly $10 billion over five years for Amtrak, including capital and operating grants. Additionally, Congress allocated $1.9 billion for intercity passenger rail capital grants to states on a federal/state matching basis. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion in capital grants for high-speed rail corridors and $325 million for rail network congestion mitigation grants. Congress allocated an annual average of $2.7 billion for intercity passenger rail, doubling previous funding levels. The act also established a process for proposals for high-speed rail projects but would require further legislation for implementation. Amtrak, the nation's sole intercity passenger rail provider, was given priority over freight trains on shared tracks. Amtrak, the nation's only provider of intercity passenger rail service, was created by Congress in 1970 to maintain a minimum level of service. Despite being structured as a private company, most of its shares are held by the United States Department of Transportation. Over the years, federal assistance to Amtrak has totaled approximately $37 billion. Amtrak operates 44 routes over 21,000 miles of track, with the Northeast Corridor being one of the most heavily used segments. Amtrak operates commuter and freight trains on the NEC, with corridor routes under 400 miles and long-distance routes over 400 miles. Some corridor routes receive state assistance. Amtrak's FY2005-FY2009 Strategic Plan called for $8 billion in federal aid, but actual funding averaged $1.3 billion annually until FY2009. Congress then allocated $2.8 billion, close to the plan's target. Amtrak has not released a Strategic Plan for FY2010-FY2014. Amtrak lacks a Strategic Plan for FY2010-FY2014 and faces financial challenges. The Department of Transportation Inspector General highlights the need for $2 billion annually to improve the system. Amtrak's current model leads to financial instability and poor service quality. The GAO criticized Amtrak's management and performance in 2005. Amtrak's President and CEO, David Gunn, was fired in 2005 for opposing restructuring proposals. The new CEO, Alexander Kummant, testified in 2006 about the importance of long-distance trains and developing rail corridors. Amtrak has shown the potential of rail travel in certain corridors, with more people traveling by train than flying between New York City and Washington, DC. Congress has included provisions in recent appropriations for Amtrak. Amtrak's recent appropriations, starting in FY2003, aim to increase transparency in finances and give DOT more control. Amtrak must submit an annual Strategic Plan and monthly financial statements to Congress. Funding now goes through the Secretary of Transportation, who grants it to Amtrak quarterly. Additional requirements were added in the 2008 reauthorization legislation, including performance improvement plans for long-distance routes and assessments of Amtrak management's implementation of the reauthorization act. Amtrak operates at a deficit of over a billion dollars. Amtrak runs a deficit of over a billion dollars each year, with long-distance routes being the most unprofitable. The DOT IG found that eliminating long-distance service would only reduce operating losses by about $300 million. Long-distance trains account for 15% of total intercity rail ridership, with 77% of passengers traveling only portions of the routes. The IG estimated potential annual operating savings of $75-158 million by eliminating highly subsidized sleeper class service. Amtrak's sleeper class service includes sleeping rooms and prepaid meals, while coach class passengers sleep in their seats on overnight trips. The DOT IG reported Amtrak's restructuring of sleeper class service to save up to $20 million in FY2007. Amtrak faces major liabilities due to deferred maintenance and accumulated debt, with an estimated $6 billion in backlogged capital maintenance needs. The DOT IG criticizes Amtrak's deferral of maintenance, which increases the risk of system failure. Amtrak has made capital spending choices like refurbishing sleeper cars instead of replacing aging bridges. The DOT IG estimates Amtrak needs $1.5 billion to $2 billion in federal support annually. Despite cost-cutting measures and workforce reductions, Amtrak's expenses still exceed its annual deficit. The DOT IG suggests addressing state-supported routes, route restructuring, and labor contracts to reduce operating subsidy. Amtrak faces competition from freight and commuter railroads for retaining its workforce and from airlines for labor productivity on corridor routes. Labor agreements did not provide flexibility in work rules for Amtrak. Amtrak faces challenges in reducing its annual deficit, with limited options for cost-cutting. The main cost categories are operating losses of long-distance trains and maintenance costs of the Northeast Corridor. Despite potential savings from reducing the system size, Amtrak's interpretation of U.S.C. 24701 as requiring nationwide service hinders significant restructuring without congressional direction. While same-route ridership has increased, increasing revenues sufficiently remains unlikely. Amtrak's revenues increased by $588 million from FY2004 to FY2008, but expenses also rose, resulting in a narrowed annual loss of $128 million. In FY2008, Congress provided $1.325 billion for Amtrak, including $475 million for operating grants and $850 million for capital and debt service grants. President Bush requested $900 million, while Amtrak requested $1.671 billion citing rising fuel, healthcare, and wage costs. Labor agreements with unions also impacted costs. Amtrak's budget request did not include $114 million in \"back pay\" recommended by the President Emergency Board for employees. The request highlighted issues with cracking concrete ties on the Northeast Corridor and the need to replace aging rolling stock. Congress provided $1.490 billion for Amtrak in 2009, $165 million more than FY2008, and allocated $90 million for passenger rail-related capital improvements. Congress provided Amtrak with additional funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including $1.3 billion for capital grants and $8 billion for high-speed rail projects. President Obama announced grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail, with $112 million allocated for improvements to the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak also received funding for operating grants and the Inspector General's Office in the FY2010 budget request. The Administration requested $1.0 billion for grants for high-speed rail projects, intercity passenger rail projects, and rail network congestion mitigation projects. Amtrak's FY2010 budget request totaled $1.84 billion, with Congress providing $1.584 billion for Amtrak. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform launched an investigation into the resignation of Amtrak's Inspector General in 2009. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding Amtrak's Office of the Inspector General as an independent agency. An amendment required Amtrak to allow passengers to transport firearms in checked baggage by a certain date or risk losing federal funding. Amtrak was given one year to implement procedures for this. The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 authorized Amtrak until December 2002 to operate without federal operating assistance. Between 2002 and 2008, Amtrak's reauthorization was delayed due to disagreements over U.S. passenger rail policy. Congress struggled to decide on funding levels and restructuring options for Amtrak, including expanding the system, maintaining the current system, focusing on profitable corridors, reducing funding and network, or eliminating Amtrak altogether. Various combinations of these options were considered. The DOT IG stated that federal funding of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for Amtrak was necessary to prevent service cuts but not enough for system improvements or new corridor development. The IG recommended that states, not Amtrak, should decide on intercity passenger rail service, and the federal government should provide funding for infrastructure repairs. In the 110th Congress, a bill was introduced for $3.3 billion in operating grants and $6.3 billion in capital grants for Amtrak. The 110th Congress introduced a bill for $3.3 billion in operating grants and $6.3 billion in capital grants for Amtrak. The bill allowed states to use operators other than Amtrak for rail service, created a capital match program with an 80% federal share, and required Amtrak to reduce operating subsidies by 40%. It also expanded Amtrak's board of directors and directed a percentage of capital grants to states. The 110th Congress introduced a bill for $3.3 billion in operating grants and $6.3 billion in capital grants for Amtrak. S. 294 was approved by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on April 25, 2007, and passed by the full Senate on October 20, 2007. Amendments included requiring Amtrak to publish annual revenue and cost amounts for each route, giving additional consideration to states with limited Amtrak service, and expressing the need to maintain Amtrak as a national passenger rail system. The House version of an Amtrak reauthorization bill (H.R. 6003) was introduced on May 8, 2008, and passed by the House on June 11, 2008, authorizing $6.7 billion in capital grants to Amtrak for FY2009-FY2013. The House bill proposed $6.7 billion in capital grants to Amtrak, including $2.5 billion for states, $3.0 billion for operating grants, $1.7 billion for debt service, and $1.1 billion for ADA compliance. It also allocated $1.8 billion for high-speed rail corridors, with one between Washington, DC, and New York City. Private companies would bid for the development and operation of these corridors. Amtrak was required to submit a plan for restoring service between New Orleans and Sanford, Florida. The bill would restructure Amtrak's board of directors and involve the Surface Transportation Board. The Senate and House bills involve the Surface Transportation Board (STB) in resolving disputes between freight railroads and passenger train interests. The Senate bill allows Amtrak or states subsidizing Amtrak service to petition the STB for investigations into on-time performance issues. The House bill requires non-binding mediation between freight railroads and public transit authorities seeking access to freight railroad right-of-ways for passenger service. Congress reauthorized Amtrak in 2008 with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013. Amtrak's funding breakdown includes operating grants of $2.9 billion, capital grants of $5.3 billion, and grants for repayment of debts and leases of $1.4 billion. The total authorized funding for Amtrak averages $1.955 billion annually, a significant increase from previous years. Additionally, new federal intercity passenger rail grant programs are authorized, including the Intercity Passenger Rail Service Corridor Capital Assistance Program and High-Speed Rail Corridor Development. Total authorized funding for these programs ranges from $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion over FY2009-FY2013. The Federal Railroad Administration authorizes grants for congestion relief and ridership growth in intercity rail corridors, with a federal share not to exceed 80%. Funding totals $325 billion over FY2010-FY2013. The act also outlines criteria for measuring Amtrak's performance, standards for route decisions, and cost allocation methodologies. Additionally, it allows for petitions to the Surface Transportation Board for on-time performance issues and negative impacts on freight railroads. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act requires the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to mediate disputes between freight railroads and public transit authorities seeking access to freight railroad right-of-ways for passenger service. It also expands Amtrak's Board of Directors and removes restrictions on board member affiliations with rail labor or management."
