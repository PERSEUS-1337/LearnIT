    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in West Africa. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, with almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO updates EVD cases regularly at http://www.who.int/ebola. Cases may be two to four times higher than reported, with concerns about weak surveillance systems in neighboring countries missing Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases. Mali reported its first EVD case on October 23, and suspicions of undetected cases in Cote d'Ivoire. WHO is sending a team to Mali for clinical management, contact tracing, and social mobilization. Efforts are underway to develop drugs for EVD treatment, with plans to test Ebola vaccines on health workers and volunteers. Supportive care is currently used for EVD symptoms, along with disease surveillance and containment measures to limit spread. WHO has released manuals for patient care, safe burial practices, and diagnostic protocols to contain outbreaks. The Ebola virus circulating in West Africa is not new, but the health systems in affected countries are ill-equipped to contain it. This outbreak is different due to its emergence in West Africa and simultaneous multi-country spread. Contact tracing and containment efforts have been successful in some countries, but challenges remain in others. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected 20 people and killed eight. A new case is being investigated in Mali by WHO. The virus is spreading in both rural and urban areas, with cases doubling every 15-20 days in Liberia and every 30-40 days in Sierra Leone. Weak health systems are contributing to the rapid spread of Ebola in affected countries. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to 20 infections and 8 deaths. A separate outbreak in the DRC began in late July, with 66 cases and 49 deaths reported. Congressional actions have been taken to address the outbreaks, including providing $88 million for response efforts and research. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to 20 infections and 8 deaths. Congress has allocated $88 million for response efforts and research. The Department of Defense has reprogrammed $750 million for Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The health systems in affected countries are weak and struggling to cope with the crisis, facing severe deficiencies in key areas. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to 20 infections and 8 deaths. Congress has allocated $88 million for response efforts and research. The Department of Defense has reprogrammed $750 million for Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The health systems in affected countries are weak and struggling to cope with the crisis, facing severe deficiencies in key areas. The unabated spread of the outbreak in affected countries has led to perceptions of government ineptitude, prompting mistrust of public officials and resistance to government responses. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist, leading to the use of armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods, deepening public resentment. Concerns about the effectiveness of quarantines have been raised, with some countries stopping quarantines in response to criticisms and protests. Despite low per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, efforts such as a sensitization campaign have been deemed successful in detecting Ebola cases. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities. Delays in compensation for health workers contribute to absenteeism. Some workers abandoned their posts during the Ebola outbreak due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, are providing financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The affected countries lack sufficient financial resources for their Ebola response plans and require support. The United Nations estimates it will cost Guinea $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the outbreak and its effects. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone requires significant financial resources for addressing health needs. Shortages of health workers and clinics in these countries are leading to inadequate access to medical care and treatment for Ebola patients. This lack of healthcare infrastructure is also impacting broader health issues, such as maternal and child health, with high mortality rates even before the outbreak. The estimated costs for addressing the outbreak are $194 million for Guinea, $473 million for Liberia, and $220 million for Sierra Leone. In 2012, over 46,000 women died from pregnancy-related complications in affected countries, along with nearly 1 million children dying before their fifth birthday. Many of these deaths could have been prevented with access to vaccines, clean water, and nutrition. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting Ebola, leading to clinic closures and limited medical attention during labor. The lack of healthcare workers in these countries contributes to high maternal and child mortality rates. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia led to a severe shortage of healthcare workers, with only about 50 doctors remaining to provide clinical care. The evacuation of expatriate doctors and deaths among health workers further diminished staffing levels. WHO reported that 443 health workers contracted Ebola, with 244 deaths, mostly in Liberia. The affected countries needed over 13,000 health workers for Ebola control, with only 5% from foreign countries. Deployment of medics from other countries has begun to address the shortage. The Ebola outbreak has led to a severe shortage of healthcare workers in affected countries, with many health facilities closed. Limited access to clinics has resulted in delayed health-seeking practices, reducing survival prospects for those sickened by Ebola. The affected countries face severe deficiencies in health services such as Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services. New health services are quickly filled up as demand exceeds supply. The Ebola outbreak has caused a severe shortage of healthcare workers in affected countries, leading to limited access to clinics and delayed health-seeking practices. Patients turned away from treatment facilities often return to their communities, potentially infecting more people. Liberia faces the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of needed beds available. U.S. plans to support the construction of 27 ETUs in Liberia. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with 90% being removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working with community leaders to adapt traditional funeral practices to prevent transmission. The poor quality of health care delivery in Ebola-affected areas is a concern, with inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols contributing to cases among health workers. CDC investigations in Liberia found multiple opportunities for transmission to healthcare workers, including inadequate use of protective equipment and lack of sanitation facilities. Water supply interruptions in health clinics further hinder sanitation efforts, with only one out of 29 health centers having running water. Ambulance services are scarce, especially in rural areas. Shortages of protective gear and equipment in Ebola-affected areas pose a risk to healthcare workers and the general population. Limited supplies of antibiotics, safe blood, and disinfectants have led to challenges in treating Ebola patients and preventing the spread of the disease. Transportation of aid workers and supplies is also hindered by resource constraints. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by poor road conditions, limited air service, and weak laboratory and surveillance systems. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but poverty, infrastructural deficiencies, and health system constraints contribute to the spread of the disease. Consumption of wild animals, driven by food insecurity, poses a risk of infection. Health officials are working to educate the public about the dangers of eating wild animals carrying EVD. Health experts are uncertain about the number and location of Ebola cases, especially in Liberia where limited laboratory capacity has led to diagnosis backlogs. The financial requirements to contain the outbreak are increasing as the number of cases rises. WHO estimated it would cost $4.8 million in March, but revised the estimate to $490 million in August as the outbreak spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The Ebola outbreak has caused over 3,600 cases and 1,800 deaths in Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The UN established a $988 million plan to address health and social impacts, with donors contributing $493 million and pledging an additional $279 million. The outbreak is causing economic disruptions and has infected over 10,000 people. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimates that $894 million has been committed for addressing the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. The World Health Organization (WHO) is leading efforts to contain the outbreak by January 2014, requesting donors to provide $490 million for various measures including building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. pledges to send health workers to the region have increased since September. Since September, countries have pledged medical support to the region to combat the Ebola outbreak, including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, China, the African Union, and the East African Community. In response to human resource constraints, the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners developed the Community Care Campaign to establish community care centers managed by NGOs, community health workers, and family members of EVD patients. The United States is a major funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global responses, with key goals including controlling the outbreak and advancing global health security. The U.S. Global Ebola strategy focuses primarily on Liberia. The United States is heavily involved in the international Ebola response, with a focus on Liberia. Nearly 900 U.S. Government personnel are stationed in the region, with over 700 military personnel deployed. U.S. efforts are built on prior capacity-building initiatives to prepare for disease outbreaks, primarily led by USAID and CDC. Since 2005, USAID has invested approximately $1 billion in pandemic preparedness programs. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million on pandemic preparedness efforts through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, operating in 18 countries in Africa and Asia. The program focuses on viral detection, risk determination, one health approach institutionalization, outbreak response capacity, and risk reduction. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak. Between March and October 2014, USAID has committed over $300 million for combating Ebola in West Africa, providing treatment beds, protective equipment, hygiene kits, and support for public awareness and disease prevention efforts. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts, including Global Disease Detection, Emerging Infectious Diseases, Global Health, Immunization, and Public Health Preparedness. Additional funding is requested for activities supporting the Global Health Security Agenda to address infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic preparedness in over 50 countries by sending experts and forming cooperative agreements. Teams were sent to Guinea and Liberia in 2014 to assist with outbreak control and management. CDC is actively involved in managing EVD cases, conducting contact tracing, and improving data management. Despite a temporary slowdown, new cases resurfaced, prompting CDC to provide technical assistance once again. In addition to training airport personnel and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages, CDC has committed over $16.7 million for Ebola responses. DOD has focused on researching treatments and vaccines, providing laboratory diagnostic assistance, and setting up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia for healthcare workers. HHS U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to manage and staff the hospital, with military personnel establishing and supplying the facility. President Barack Obama announced the launch of \"Operation United Assistance\" in Monrovia, Liberia, deploying 4,000 U.S. military forces overseen by DOD U.S. Africa Command. The operation supports relief efforts, trains health workers, and establishes 12 treatment centers in Liberia. Efforts include building ETCs, deploying medical labs for EVD testing, and funding for supplies and technical advisors. The current Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia has overwhelmed the governments and weakened health systems. Congress has allocated over $1 billion in funding for the global Ebola response. The WHO estimates that 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the outbreak, with a shortage of personnel in Liberia. The United States has deployed military forces and provided funding for treatment centers and technical support. Additional funds may be requested to contain the outbreak. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia has led to limited access to care. The Community Care Campaign faces challenges in quality control and infection prevention, raising concerns about virus transmission within the CCC. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the campaign turning into \"contamination centers\" without proper measures in place. The concern arises regarding adherence to IPC protocols by organizations, community health workers, and family members, especially lay personnel providing Ebola care in CCCs. WHO recommends only one family member should provide care for each patient in CCCs to prevent EVD spread. Challenges may arise in enforcing this guideline due to common collective familial care practices in Liberia, along with factors like loss of income and emotional stress. IPC protocol mandates PPE use for handling soiled linen, cleaning CCCs, and safe burial practices. In order to prevent the spread of EVD within CCCs, caretakers must follow strict protocol in using PPE and managing waste. The affected countries face deficiencies in waste management, with less than 20% having access to improved sanitation facilities. Ensuring adherence to IPC protocol among lay care takers without medical training may be a challenge. The Community Care Campaign calls for once daily supervisory visits by health care workers trained in IPC to monitor compliance with protocols. Due to poor supply chain management, health clinics in affected countries lack essential medical supplies like gloves, masks, and gowns, leading to a lack of protective equipment in ETUs and clinics. WHO advises a gradual approach to ensuring continuous supply of commodities to CCCs. USAID is overseeing the management of Community Care Centers in the U.S. with grants to NGOs. The White House reports that the United States Government has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia. NGOs have autonomy over USAID grants implementation, with oversight to ensure program targets are met. Concerns exist about U.S. oversight of grantees managing CCCs and standardization of quality control. Critics question WHO leadership in the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts affecting effectiveness and outbreak containment. WHO's budget reduction in outbreak response activities has led to staff cuts and operational capacity limitations. Critics also point to bureaucratic bloat and undue influence hindering WHO's response efforts. Critics argue that WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak has been hindered by bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff. There are debates on whether WHO should focus on advisory roles or maintain operational capacity. Some suggest creating a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO to address long-term health system capacity and emergencies like Ebola. The spread of EVD in West Africa is due to weak health systems. Donors have struggled with how to address health emergencies in countries with dysfunctional health systems. Donors shifted to disease-specific funding through non-governmental organizations, sparking debate on its impact on public health systems. The introduction of PEPFAR aimed to combat HIV/AIDS deaths by funding non-governmental organizations, saving millions of lives but creating dependency on U.S. support. In the second phase of PEPFAR, resources were directed towards strengthening health systems to build country capacity. In its third phase, debate on the use of PEPFAR funds for building health systems has resumed. A 2013 GAO report noted that roughly 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. Health system advocates fear that budgetary reforms may imperil efforts to bolster health systems. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries need support to contain it. If the outbreak is arrested, countries may not be better prepared for future disease outbreaks without strong health systems. Ken Isaacs from Samaritan's Purse highlighted the importance of focusing on emergency response during deadly disease outbreaks like Ebola, rather than solely building capacity. USAID has formed a working group to strengthen health systems post-outbreak, but funding for broader health system strengthening efforts is limited. The U.S. Congress may need to reassess how global health funds are allocated in response to the ongoing Ebola crisis. A variety of U.S. agencies are responding to the ongoing Ebola outbreak, with the Department of State leading diplomatic engagements, USAID coordinating responses, CDC heading public health activities, and DOD providing support for foreign armed forces. The budgetary structure of these agencies allows them to draw from flexible accounts for unanticipated events. The Department of State's coordination efforts do not require additional funding, while CDC and DOD activities can be financed through various accounts without explicit congressional direction. Congress has established directives on foreign aid fund usage. USAID receives specific direction from Congress on fund usage, limiting flexibility during unanticipated events like the Ebola outbreak. Funds are being reprogrammed from other health efforts to address the current outbreak. Supporters view congressional directives as necessary for oversight, while opponents argue it hinders agility in the field. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with proper surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be minimized. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, but with the emergence of Ebola in West Africa, there is concern about the region's readiness for another outbreak. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is lower than the previous year, and even if funded at the previous level, it may not be sufficient. Experts predict containment by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing long-term disruptions. Villages in Sierra Leone have lost many adults, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Observers are concerned about the growing number of children orphaned by Ebola in West and Central Africa, adding to existing orphan populations due to armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. The outbreak is hindering governments' capacity to address health issues, leading to fears of rising child and maternal mortality rates. The full health effects of Ebola may not be known until containment, prompting a reassessment of global health assistance funds by Congress. Since 1976, multiple Ebola outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa with no specific cure or vaccine available. Experimental treatments are being tested, raising ethical debates about fairness in distribution. Advocates are pushing for increased health assistance funds to address worsening health and development issues post-Ebola, including maternal and child mortality, poverty, and water-borne infections. WHO announced in August that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions for Ebola treatment under certain conditions. In October, they planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. A limited amount of experimental treatment may be available in Liberia by early November. WHO convened a meeting with various stakeholders to discuss and agree on the use of experimental treatments. Regulatory agencies, vaccine manufacturers, and funding agencies met to fast track testing and deployment of Ebola vaccines. WHO warned neighboring countries of Ebola risk, with Mali reporting its first case. Oxford University study raised concerns about future outbreaks in Central and West Africa. Human mobility could impact Ebola dispersion. The potential impacts of future Ebola outbreaks in urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness capacity are being questioned, including the effectiveness of the U.S. response, support for pandemic preparedness efforts, and the reprogramming of USAID funds. Ongoing outbreak responses aim to improve the capacity of affected countries and regions to identify, detect, and respond to future outbreaks."
