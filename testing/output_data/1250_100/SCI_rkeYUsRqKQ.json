    "content": "In this paper, the phredGAN system extends the persona-based Seq2Seq neural network conversation model to a multi-turn dialogue scenario by modifying the hredGAN architecture. It includes a persona-based HRED generator (PHRED) and a conditional discriminator. Two approaches are explored for the conditional discriminator: $phredGAN_a$ passes attribute representation as an additional input into an adversarial discriminator, while $phredGAN_d$ uses a dual discriminator system. Performance is evaluated on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and TV series transcripts from Big Bang Theory and Friends using quantitative measures and human evaluation. Trade-offs from using either variant of $phredGAN$ are also discussed. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly with deep neural networks, have greatly advanced natural language processing and dialogue modeling research. However, developing a conversation model that enables fluent interaction between humans and machines is still in its early stages. Existing work often relies on limited dialogue history, assuming that model parameters can capture all dataset modalities. Yet, dialogue corpora are typically multi-modal, making it challenging for neural network models to disambiguate characteristics like speaker personality and location. Most research in this area has focused on optimizing dialogue consistency, with approaches like the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (HRED) network architecture. BID8 introduces a modified HRED generator with an adversarial discriminator to enhance diversity and guarantee the generator's output. While hredGAN improves response quality, it lacks capturing speaker attributes and generating persona-specific responses. Previous work includes integrating attribute embeddings into a Seq2Seq generative dialogue model to capture speaker identity and interactions. The PHRED generator with local attention allows the system to condition its response on utterance attributes like speaker identity. Different approaches have been proposed to capture speaker attributes, but existing persona-based models have limitations in dialogue history and response generation. To address these issues, two variants of an adversarially trained persona model are proposed. The proposed variants of an adversarially trained persona conversational generative system, phredGAN a and phredGAN d, aim to maintain response quality while capturing speaker and other attribute modalities within the conversation. Both systems use the same PHRED generator architecture with additional utterance attribute representation. Injecting attributes allows for generating responses conditioned on specific attributes across conversation turns. The difference between the two systems lies in the discriminator architecture based on how the attribute is treated. The phredGAN models are trained on customer service data and TV show transcripts to demonstrate their capabilities. They outperform state-of-the-art conversational models in terms of response quality and various evaluation metrics. The models combine the hredGAN architecture with attribute representation to generate responses conditioned on specific attributes. The dual discriminator system includes a word-level discriminator for dialogue coherency and an utterance-level attribute discriminator. The hredGAN BID8 model formulates multi-turn dialogue response generation using a conditional GAN structure. The generator is trained to produce sequences that are indistinguishable from the ground truth, minimizing cross-entropy loss. The framework includes a dual discriminator system for dialogue coherency and attribute prediction. The phredGAN architecture, derived from hredGAN BID8, utilizes a shared encoder and embedding representation for the generator and discriminator. It introduces an additional input attribute C i representing speaker/utterance attributes. The generator's input/output attributes are C i and C i+1, with learned embeddings for attribute tokens. The encoder incorporates the source attribute C i in the context RNN, cRNN, using attention over source attribute representations. Both phredGAN versions share the same generator architecture (PHRED) but have different discriminators. The generator in the phredGAN architecture uses the output of eRN N and dRN N to create a context state for a turn i. Different noise injection methods are explored, and the optimization objective includes adversarial and attribute prediction loss. The MLE loss is also common in the architecture. phredGAN architecture incorporates attribute discrimination at both word and utterance levels to capture attribute modalities and shape generator outputs. Attributes such as style, gender, and location are used to exhibit personality traits in dialogue models. The phredGAN architecture includes attribute discrimination at word and utterance levels to influence generator outputs. The encoder and decoder RNNs have specific configurations and shared components for end-to-end training. The system utilizes word and attribute embeddings with specific sizes and configurations for effective training. The phredGAN architecture incorporates various discriminators, including a generator decoder RNN, an adversarial discriminator, and an attribute discriminator. These components have specific configurations and utilize different mechanisms for training and evaluation. The model is trained using full softmax for evaluation and parameters updates are based on word-level discriminator accuracy. The model is implemented, trained, and evaluated using TensorFlow. A linear search is performed for \u03b1 with sample size L = 1 to determine the optimum value for all inferences and evaluations. During inference, dialogue response generation is conditioned on various inputs including encoder outputs, noise samples, word embedding, and attribute embedding. Multiple noise samples are used to rank generator outputs by the discriminator, with the final response being the highest ranked. In this section, the performance of PHRED, phredGAN a, and phredGAN d on conversational datasets is explored and compared to non-adversarial persona Seq2seq models and adversarial hredGAN. The models are trained on transcripts from TV series like Big Bang Theory and Friends, with a corpus of 5,008 lines of dialogue split into training, development, and test sets. The models are first trained on the Movie Triplets Corpus before fine-tuning on the TV series transcripts due to the small dataset size. The model is pre-trained on the Movie Triplets Corpus to avoid overfitting on a small persona TV series dataset. It is then reinitialized for training on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, consisting of 1.85 million conversations with two speaker types: questioner and helper. The dataset also includes utterances that do not fit these categories, but for consistency, it is assumed that there are only two speaker types. The experiment results show that phredGAN a and phredGAN d can differentiate between the two speaker types in the dataset. Evaluation metrics include perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, distinct n-gram, and normalized average sequence length scores. Human evaluation involves judges ranking response quality based on relevance, informativeness, and persona. The scores are normalized between 0 and 1 and averaged over samples and judges. Comparisons are made between non-adversarial persona HRED model, PHRED, and adversarially trained models hredGAN, phredGAN a. The comparison between persona HRED model, PHRED, and adversarially trained models hredGAN, phredGAN a is conducted to demonstrate the impact of adversarial training. Additionally, Li et al.'s work BID5, which incorporates persona embeddings into a Seq2Seq framework, is also compared. Optimal noise injection methods and variance values are determined for phredGAN models on different datasets. The optimal noise injection methods and variance values for phredGAN models on different datasets are determined. Performance comparisons of phredGAN against baselines, PHRED, hredGAN, and Li et al.'s persona Seq2Seq models are presented, showing significant improvements with the addition of persona information. PHRED performs worse than baseline models on limited datasets due to less informative responses. The study compares the performance of different models, including phredGAN, PHRED, hredGAN, and persona Seq2Seq models, on response diversity and quality when conditioned on persona information. PhredGAN shows improvements in generating diverse and informative responses, even with limited dataset, due to adversarial training. The evaluation results on the UDC dataset show that phredGAN outperforms other models in various metrics, including perplexity. PhredGAN variants outperform hredGAN in evaluation metrics, showing better response quality with persona attributes. PhredGAN strikes a balance between diversity and precision, with phredGAN d performing best. Recommendations are made based on dataset attributes. Human evaluation results are also reported. The human evaluation results for TV Series and UDC datasets are presented in tables 1 and 2. PhredGAN shows superior performance on TV Series, while both hredGAN and phredGAN perform similarly on UDC, indicating a trade-off between diversity and persona. Qualitative assessment in TAB2 shows that phredGAN responses are more informative than BID5 Speaker-Addressee model for TV drama series. The phredGAN model demonstrates the ability to construct distinct attribute embeddings for each character, even with limited data. It can infer context and important character information about the addressee, as shown in tables 3 and 4. The model improves upon persona-based response generation models by responding differently to input utterances while staying close to the conversation context. In this paper, phredGAN models improve persona-based response generation by incorporating attribute representation into an adversarial discriminator. The dual discriminator system, phredGAN d, predicts intrinsic attributes of input utterances, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements over previous models. Future work includes leveraging phredGAN d's ability to predict utterance attributes like speaker identity. The study highlights the benefits of adversarial training for persona generative dialogue systems. The study demonstrates the benefits of adversarial training for persona generative dialogue systems, showcasing improvements in response generation. The phredGAN models incorporate attribute representation into an adversarial discriminator, leading to quantitative and qualitative enhancements in predicting utterance attributes. Future work may involve utilizing phredGAN's ability to predict speaker identity. The study shows the advantages of adversarial training for persona generative dialogue systems, improving response generation. PhredGAN models use attribute representation in a discriminator, enhancing the prediction of utterance attributes. The discriminator scores responses based on persona attributes, with longer and more informative responses receiving higher scores. The responses also show contextual consistency, referencing background information in the conversation.

Additionally, distinct communication styles are observed between the asker and the helper, as seen in TAB7 where the helper suggests the asker may not be using the correct driver when unable to hear music. Samples from the PHRED generator on both UDC and TV series datasets are also provided in TAB5 for completion."
