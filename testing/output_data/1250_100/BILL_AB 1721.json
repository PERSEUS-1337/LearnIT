    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges the need to produce 11,900,000 degrees and credentials by 2025, with a projected gap of 2,400,000. California's community colleges are vital in closing this gap, especially for low-income students. Financial aid programs like the Cal Grant and BOG Fee Waiver are crucial in supporting students' enrollment and success in college. The Cal Grant Program awards over $2 billion annually, making it the largest state grant program in the nation. The BOG Fee Waiver Program provides free tuition to almost half of all California Community College students. However, access grants do not cover all college costs, leaving many low-income students without support. Needy students at California community colleges face higher costs compared to attending UC or CSU after accounting for all financial aid available. The California Master Plan for Higher Education guarantees affordable education for all Californians. The Legislature aims to increase grant aid to cover nontuition costs for community college students, especially those in career technical education programs. California community colleges are encouraged to educate students about financial aid options and urge them to apply by the deadline. Starting from the 2001-02 academic year, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program was established for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award. These awards are not entitlements and the selection process is based on specific criteria set by the commission. From the 2016-17 academic year onwards, up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards are granted annually on a competitive basis for eligible applicants. Starting from the 2001-02 academic year, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program was established for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award. These awards are not entitlements and the selection process is based on specific criteria set by the commission. Up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards are granted annually on a competitive basis for eligible applicants. Fifteen thousand awards are available to all students meeting financial and academic requirements, with a March 2 deadline for baccalaureate degree institutions and a choice of March 2 or September 2 deadline for California community college students. Nineteen thousand awards are reserved for California community college students, with a September 2 deadline for application. Additionally, students in occupational or technical training courses at a California community college are eligible for Cal Grant B awards starting from the 2017-18 academic year. The commission will distribute any remaining awards to eligible students based on lowest expected family contribution and highest academic merit, with special consideration for disadvantaged students. Selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards under the competitive program will be established by February 1, 2001, considering various hindrances to postsecondary education access. Additional consideration is given to students pursuing Cal Grant B awards who reestablish their grade point averages and those who did not receive awards in previous articles. All other eligible students can compete for an award. Terms like \"career pathway,\" \"economic security,\" \"industry cluster,\" and \"long-term unemployed\" are defined in this section. Cal Grant C awards are for occupational or technical training lasting at least four months. The number of awards remains the same each year as in 2015-16. The commission considers various criteria when selecting grant recipients, giving priority to disadvantaged students facing economic hardship or barriers to employment. Factors include family income, household size, and household status. Cal Grant C awards can be renewed until completion of training, with a maximum duration of two years. Recipients can use the grants for tuition, fees, training-related costs, and living expenses. The commission considers the applicant's financial situation and available state and federal programs when determining award amounts. The commission, in consultation with state and federal agencies, identifies areas of occupational training for Cal Grant C awards. They consult with industry clusters and educators to prioritize programs. The training areas are reviewed every five years, with an update required by January 1, 2016. The commission prioritizes Cal Grant C awards for students in occupational or technical training based on criteria like employer demand, employment growth, and salary projections. At least one of these criteria must be met to receive priority. The commission collaborates with various departments and organizations to determine areas of occupational or technical training that meet specific criteria. They use projections from the Labor Market Information Data Library and may supplement with other analyses. The commission maintains a current list on their website and updates it as needed. The commission collaborates with departments to assess training programs based on graduation rates, job placement, and salary data. They prioritize Cal Grant C applicants for high-rated programs. Additionally, they work with agencies to publicize the grant program to long-term unemployed individuals. The commission collaborates with various departments to assess training programs and prioritize Cal Grant C applicants. They consult with relevant agencies to make students aware of job search services. The Legislative Analyst's Office is required to submit a report on the outcomes of the Cal Grant C program biennially. The Legislative Analyst's Office is tasked with reporting on the outcomes of the Cal Grant C program biennially.
