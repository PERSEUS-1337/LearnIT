    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hormone Disruption Research Act of 2002\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that many compounds introduced into the environment can disrupt hormone systems in humans and animals, leading to various health disorders. The United States has seen an increase in diseases like childhood cancers and diabetes, possibly due to exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals. Further research is needed, especially on the impact of prenatal exposures on children's health. The \"National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals\" highlighted high levels of certain chemicals in consumer products, with potential hazards to human health. Wildlife populations have been affected by hormone-disrupting substances, showing various effects such as thyroid dysfunction, decreased fertility, birth deformities, and compromised immune systems. Laboratory studies have confirmed these effects and identified biological mechanisms. The chemicals found in wildlife are also present in humans, exposing both to the same substances. Hormone disruption can occur at low doses, especially during rapid development in the womb or after birth. Congress recognized children's vulnerability to pesticides in 1996 but the EPA has not mandated screening for hormone disruptors. In 1998, a research committee concluded that more scientific knowledge is needed for public policy. In 1999, the National Academy of Sciences compiled research priorities on hormone disruption funded by Congress. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences conducts federal research on hormone disruption, supported by Congress for animal testing alternatives. The US Geological Survey assesses chemical occurrence in the environment. The US Geological Survey assesses chemicals in the environment, ecological and wildlife health hazards, and effects on wildlife from chemicals. The National Academy of Sciences recognizes USGS expertise in food web contamination and water quality assessment, encouraging collaboration with the National Institutes of Health on human health research. The Public Health Services Act is amended to include a national program for research on hormone disruption. The Public Health Services Act is amended to establish a comprehensive program within the Institute to conduct research on the impact of chemicals that disrupt hormone systems, their occurrence in the environment, effects on ecological and wildlife health, and coordination of research initiatives nationally and internationally. The Director will report to the public every 2 years on the threat posed by hormone-disrupting chemicals. The program established under the Public Health Services Act will study the human health effects of hormone disrupting chemicals, including exposures during critical life stages and in different settings. It will also focus on wildlife species' exposure to these chemicals. The Hormone Disruption Research Act of 2002 focuses on researching the effects of hormone disrupting chemicals on human health and the environment. The Director of the Institute, in consultation with the Director of the USGS, is responsible for coordinating this research program. This includes studying mechanisms of interaction, improved screening methods, and identifying the levels and fate of these chemicals in the environment. The Hormone Disruption Research Act of 2002 establishes the transfer of funds to other Federal agencies for research on hormone disruption. The Director of the Institute, in consultation with the Director of the USGS, must report findings every 2 years on the threat of hormone disruption by chemicals. Additionally, an Interagency Commission will be established to advise on research agenda development, consisting of 12 members. The Interagency Commission consists of 12 members, including the Director of the Institute, the Director of the USGS, the Commissioner of the FDA, the Director of the CDC, the Administrator of NOAA, the Director of NIOSH, the Administrator of ATSDR, the Director of the FWS, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the EPA, the Chairman of the CPSC, and the Director of the National Science. The Interagency Commission, consisting of 12 members including key government officials, will recommend a research program on hormone disruption within 12 months of the Act's enactment. Public comments will be sought, and a review of the program will be conducted within 4 years. Staff from each represented department will assist in carrying out the Commission's duties. The Interagency Commission will review the program on hormone disruption and report to the Director of the Institute and the Hormone Disruption Research Panel. The Director may provide financial assistance for research activities, and a Hormone Disruption Research Panel will advise on the program's scientific content and progress. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel, established under subsection (a), advises the Director of the Institute on program progress, public outreach, and provides requested advice. The Panel consists of 15 voting members appointed by the President, including representatives from environmental protection, public health, consumer organizations, and industry. The majority of members are scientists and environmental health professionals. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel consists of 15 voting members appointed by the President. Members must have diverse backgrounds in health sciences, represent various geographical regions, and have experience in endocrine disruption research. They serve an initial 3-year term, with the option for reappointment for an additional 2 years. The Panel elects a chairperson from among its members and meets as needed. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel provides administrative support and requires conflict of interest disclosures for grants and contracts. Definitions include 'hormone' as a biological response trigger and 'hormone disruption' as interference with natural hormone functions in the body. Authorization of Appropriations: $500,000,000 authorized for a 5-year period starting in 2003 for homeostasis, reproduction, development, function, or behavior. Restrictions on fund use include limits on construction, rehabilitation, and administrative expenses. The Director of the Institute will carry out public outreach activities using 1-5% of the funds allocated for the program."
