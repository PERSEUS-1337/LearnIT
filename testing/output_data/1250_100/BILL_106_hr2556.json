    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. Participating employers are those who voluntarily engage in telecommuting. The pilot program aims to reduce emissions of ozone precursors by evaluating methods for calculating reductions in vehicle-miles-traveled through telecommuting. Regulated entities under the Clean Air Act are involved in the program. The pilot program aims to reduce emissions of ozone precursors by evaluating methods for calculating reductions in vehicle-miles-traveled through telecommuting. Participating employers can transfer emission credits achieved by reduced VMTs to other entities through a commercial trading forum. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through trades and exchanges, presenting them to the Federal Government or State as required by the Clean Air Act. The pilot program aims to reduce emissions of ozone precursors by evaluating methods for calculating reductions in vehicle-miles-traveled through telecommuting. Participating employers can transfer emission credits achieved by reduced VMTs to other entities through a commercial trading forum. The Federal Government would explore means to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between participating employers and regulated entities in specific geographic areas. The Secretary, in consultation with the grantee, will select three additional areas for the pilot program. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the chosen geographic area. The Secretary will require the grantee to study and report to Congress on the potential impact of the program on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. Authorization of $250,000 for fiscal year 2000 for grants to improve individual, family, and community quality of life. Amounts are available until expended."
