The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" mandates federal agencies to disclose settlement agreements requiring payments of at least $200,000 in attorney fees, costs, or expenses by non-Federal entities. The act also defines terms like 'entity within the Federal Government' and 'non-Federal person', and requires the posting of covered settlement agreements online by Executive agencies. The Executive agency must disclose details of covered settlement agreements, including the date, parties involved, claims settled, payment obligations, and total settlement amount. The settlement agreement must include details such as payment obligations, penalties, non-deductible amounts, and where the collected funds will be deposited.

Executive agencies must disclose settlement agreements publicly for at least 5 years, unless subject to confidentiality provisions. The settlement agreement must be publicly available for a minimum of 5 years, unless confidentiality is necessary to protect the public interest of the United States. The Executive agency must issue a public statement explaining why confidentiality is needed to protect the public interest of the United States, detailing the interests confidentiality protects and why they outweigh the public's interest in government conduct and resource expenditure. Written public statements must specify if any amount to be paid under a settlement agreement is a penalty for violating federal law or not deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires disclosure of details in settlement agreements, including actions non-Federal persons will take instead of payment to the government and any payments to other non-Federal persons. Confidentiality provisions apply unless disclosure is necessary. Reporting on settlement agreements is required annually by January 15. The head of an Executive agency must report annually to Congress by January 15 on covered settlement agreements, including the number of agreements, confidentiality terms, and total attorney fees and costs incurred. The Executive agency must report annually to Congress on settlement agreements, including attorney fees, costs, and the number of agreements involving regulatory action.

The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress on how Executive agencies determine the confidentiality of settlement agreements, with recommendations for increasing transparency while protecting legitimate interests. Passed the Senate on September 21, 2015."
