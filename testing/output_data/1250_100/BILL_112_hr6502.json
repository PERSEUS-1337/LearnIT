The Act \"Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012\" allows the Secretary to designate a combination of drugs as significant if it includes 2 or more drugs that offer potential advancement in treating serious diseases and meet criteria for codevelopment as specified by the FDA. The Secretary can designate a combination of drugs as significant for codevelopment to encourage the development of drug combinations based on recommendations from a codevelopment task force. Manufacturers can request the Secretary to determine if a drug combination is significant within 30 days of submission. The Secretary can designate a combination of drugs as significant for codevelopment based on recommendations from a task force. Manufacturers can request this determination within 30 days of submission. If the combination meets requirements, the Secretary will provide notice of its significance. The Secretary can designate a drug combination as significant for codevelopment based on recommendations from a task force. Manufacturers can request this determination within 30 days of submission. If the combination does not meet requirements, the Secretary will provide notice that it is not significant. Requests for designation must be made concurrently with or after the submission of an application for drug investigation, but not later than the completion of phase I trials for any of the drugs involved. The Secretary will develop and publish a list of significant drug combinations annually, including new combinations and excluding those no longer meeting requirements. This is in accordance with the Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012. Prior to drug approval under section 505(b), if a significant drug combination was designated by the Secretary, the approval periods specified in section 505 will be extended by 6 months. This extension does not apply to certain types of drug approvals. If a drug in a significant drug combination is designated, the Secretary must review and act on any related application within 6 months. This applies to changes in indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, or strength, as well as modifications to the drug structure that do not affect safety or effectiveness. The Secretary must review and act on any related application within 6 months for a drug in a significant drug combination. This applies to changes in indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, or strength, as well as modifications to the drug structure that do not affect safety or effectiveness. The definition of 'significantly advance treatment' for a drug combination is providing treatment for life-threatening or serious diseases with no existing therapy, or demonstrating improved effects on serious outcomes compared to alternative therapies. The Secretary must review and act on any related application within 6 months for a drug in a significant drug combination, including changes in indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, or strength. The definition of 'significantly advance treatment' for a drug combination is providing treatment for life-threatening or serious diseases with no existing therapy, or demonstrating improved effects on serious outcomes compared to alternative therapies. Additionally, a drug can be considered for expedited review if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a condition, or if it is part of a significant drug combination designated under section 505E(a). The Codevelopment Task Force is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes an interagency task force to promote codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations. The task force includes experts in research and drug development for serious diseases like cancer. Its duties include recommending a list of significant drug combinations for designation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The interagency task force will make the list of significant drug combinations publicly available for public comment. They will revise the list based on feedback and submit updates annually to the Secretary and Congress. Additionally, the task force will submit a policy report to the Secretary and Congress annually. The interagency task force will submit a report to Congress identifying challenges and opportunities for codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations, along with recommendations for policy changes to support this. Before submission, a draft of the report will be made publicly available for comments. The task force under subsection (a) is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. A \"significant drug combination\" refers to a combination of 2 or more drugs that have the potential to advance treatment for serious diseases, meet FDA criteria for codevelopment, and include at least 2 unapproved drugs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the impact of exclusivity extensions on significant drug combinations. Interim findings will be shared with the task force and the public, with an opportunity for comments. Final findings will be submitted to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment."
