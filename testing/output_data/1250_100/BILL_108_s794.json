The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. Higher standards can also be set by regulation. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 17 to 21.5 miles per gallon. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 17 to 27.5 miles per gallon. If the Secretary does not increase the standard within 24 months, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not increasing the standard. SEC. 3. Increased inclusiveness of definitions for automobiles and passenger automobiles. SEC. 3. Increased inclusiveness of definitions for automobiles and passenger automobiles. \n\n(a) Automobile.--Paragraph (3) of section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase the weight limits for automobiles to 12,000 pounds. Section 32908(a)(1) is also amended to raise the weight limit to 14,000 pounds.\n\n(b) Passenger Automobile.--The definition of a passenger automobile is revised to include vehicles with a gross weight of 12,000 pounds or less. The weight limits for automobiles and passenger automobiles have been increased to 12,000 pounds. Certain vehicle types are excluded from this definition, such as those with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in length that is not readily accessible from the passenger compartment. These amendments apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the changes. The weight limits for automobiles and passenger automobiles have been increased to 12,000 pounds for vehicles manufactured after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under title 49, United States Code, with annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. The amendment to the Labor section involves removing and redesignating certain subparagraphs. The changes apply to automobiles manufactured after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including assessments of fuel economy accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult on the preparation of the biennial report on automobile fuel economy testing quality. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the relevant chapter. The Secretary of Transportation will submit the first biennial report on testing quality to Congress in 2005. A study will be conducted to improve the process for measuring fuel economy by determining the most accurate testing process for automobile fuel economy in various usage scenarios. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of the Act, detailing determinations and comparisons made in a study on automobile fuel economy ratings. The report will also include an estimate of the average adjustment to fuel economy ratings. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy, aligning ratings with automobile fuel economy ratings calculated under the most accurate testing process. This procedure will be applied to determine the average fuel economy of each model of automobile under chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 based on a revised testing procedure to improve accuracy in calculating fuel economy. The Secretary will ensure that the amended fuel economy standards are as stringent as the original standards under section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, if the testing procedure had not been revised. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment sets fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles, requiring a minimum of 20% of executive agency leased or purchased passenger automobiles to have a fuel economy rating. In fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must have at least 10,000 vehicles with a fuel economy rating 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard for that year."
