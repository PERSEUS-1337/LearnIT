    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Christopher Bryski Student Loan Protection Act\" and \"Christopher's Law\" address the lack of requirements for lenders to provide information on durable power of attorney and responsibilities in case of borrower or cosigner incapacitation or death. Additionally, statistics on traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries are highlighted. The incidence of spinal cord injuries in the United States is approximately 40 cases per 1,000,000 people, with 12,000 new cases each year. There has been no recent overall incidence study since the 1970s. In the 2007-2008 academic year, 13% of students at public schools and 26.2% at private schools borrowed from private lenders. By 2009, cosigned private education loans increased from 66% to 84% of all private education loans. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL STUDENT LOAN PROTECTIONS. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include additional protections for borrowers and cosigners of private education loans, requiring educational institutions to provide information on creating a durable power of attorney for financial decision-making. Private educational lenders must also provide information on durable power of attorneys to borrowers and cosigners. The Truth in Lending Act now requires private educational lenders to clearly describe cosigners' obligations for private education loans, including the impact of borrower or cosigner death, disability, or inability to work. The Board will provide model forms for this information. The Board will provide uniform model forms for durable power of attorney for financial decision-making and describe a cosigner's obligations for private education loans in case of death, disability, or inability to work. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include definitions for \"durable power of attorney\" and \"cosigner.\" The durable power of attorney refers to written instructions for financial decision-making when an individual lacks capacity. A cosigner is defined as someone liable for another's obligation without compensation. The Truth in Lending Act now defines \"cosigner\" as someone liable for another's obligation without compensation, excluding a spouse needed to perfect a security interest in a loan. SEC. 3. FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS. Section 485(l)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include information on loan discharge due to death, disability, or inability to work, as well as details on repayment obligations for private education loans. Additionally, it includes a reference to the model form for durable power of attorneys published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Truth in Lending Act requires institutions to provide borrowers with information on accessing a model form specific to their state of residence. The Truth in Lending Act requires institutions to provide borrowers with state-specific model forms. Passed by the House of Representatives on September 28, 2010."
