    "content": "SECTION 1. CROP DISASTER ASSISTANCE. In this section, definitions for additional coverage, insurable commodity, and noninsurable commodity are provided. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to use funds for emergency financial assistance to producers. The Secretary authorizes assistance for producers who incurred crop losses in 2003 or 2004 due to weather conditions. Assistance will be administered similarly to previous acts, with eligibility criteria based on insurance coverage for the affected crops. The Secretary may waive requirements for producers who incurred crop losses due to weather conditions in 2003 or 2004. Producers must enter into a contract agreeing to obtain insurance coverage for the next 2 crops for insurable commodities and file paperwork for noninsurable commodities. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7333) outlines the reimbursement process for producers who violate a contract, requiring them to repay the full assistance amount. Payment limitations are also specified, with assistance not exceeding 95% of the crop's value in the absence of losses, including crop insurance payments. The producer's assistance under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 may be reduced if they receive assistance for the same loss under Florida Disaster Programs. The Livestock Assistance Program is outlined in Section 2. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide emergency financial assistance for livestock losses in designated counties for either 2003 or 2004. The assistance will be administered similarly to the American Indian livestock program. Eligibility for payments will not penalize producers. The Secretary will not penalize a producer for reducing livestock numbers during a disaster year when providing assistance.
