    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and increased difficulties in implementing domestic farmer support programs. The agreement was approved subject to consultations regarding the Canadian Wheat Board's price setting policy. The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and increased difficulties in implementing domestic farmer support programs. This includes setting policy of the CWB affecting goods exported to the United States and the need for consultations on transport rates for agricultural goods originating in Canada. Despite the provisions, there has been no progress on these consultations, leading to a flawed binational panel decision. The binational panel decision under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement disregards Article 701(3) by allowing the sale of agricultural goods below acquisition price for export. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY.\n\nThe President must negotiate with Canada to determine Canadian Wheat Board's selling price to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be in violation of the Free-Trade Agreement, and grain imports will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed.\n\nSEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President will negotiate with Canada to exclude agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President will negotiate with Canada to clarify the meaning of \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers, and other incurred costs. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. Title II of the Tariff Act of 1930 requires Federal agencies to assist petitioners in countervailing duty cases related to Canadian subsidies on wheat and barley exports. Additionally, Section 201 promotes the use of export enhancement programs to boost grain exports. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the United States by allowing exporters to compete effectively with Canadian grain producers, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to counteract transportation subsidies and pricing strategies by the Canadian Wheat Board until agreements are reached with the Government of Canada. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to include a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection. The term 'agricultural trade program' refers to various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, excluding specific market promotion programs under different acts. The Charter Act defines terms such as covered foreign commodity, entry, person, Secretary, and United States agricultural commodity. SEC. 1582. Monitoring of domestic uses made of certain foreign commodities. SEC. 1582 requires an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and quarterly reports from consignees certifying usage and compliance with the certificate. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required under SEC. 1582 must include details such as importer and consignee information, country of origin, description and quantity of the commodity, and the purpose of use by the consignee. The consignee must provide information on the transporter of the foreign commodity and details of end-use certificates in the quarterly report, including the quantity used, exported, and purpose of use. The importer or first consignee of a covered foreign commodity must report the quantity, disposition, and transfer details in a quarterly report. The Secretary may also require reporting of sales prices for enforcement purposes. Confidentiality of purchaser information is ensured, and entry is prohibited without presenting an end-use certificate. The Commissioner of Customs requires an end-use certificate for the entry of covered foreign commodities. Failure to present the certificate may result in penalties under customs laws. Violations of requirements set by the Secretary can lead to civil penalties of up to $10,000. The Secretary will establish regulations for compliance, including the submission of quarterly reports. SEC. 1583. Compliance provisions under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to authorized programs. SEC. 1584. Suspension or debarment for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from an agricultural trade program for misusing foreign agricultural commodities. The Corporation can waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the misuse was unintentional and involved less than 1 percent of the total commodity quantity. The amendment made by this section will not affect a person's liability for penalties imposed under an agricultural trade program for the quantity of foreign agricultural commodities. This section and its amendment will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The amendment made by this section will not affect a person's liability for penalties imposed under an agricultural trade program for the quantity of foreign agricultural commodities."
