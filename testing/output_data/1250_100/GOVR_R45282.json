    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the current fee framework for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the fee framework for EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 modified provisions related to the collection and use of maintenance and registration service fees for pesticide registrations, adding new categories of applications and adjusting fee amounts. EPA is required to complete its review of applications within specific timeframes based on the category of application if the fee is collected. The current pesticide fee framework, established by PRIA 3 in 2012 and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018, with a cap on the aggregate amount that EPA may collect annually. Registrants failing to pay maintenance fees risk cancellation of their pesticide registration. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from maintenance fees. Maintenance fees collected are deposited into the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund.\" The maintenance fees collected are deposited into the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury, providing EPA with mandatory appropriations for various activities related to pesticide registration. EPA is required to use funds to enhance information systems capabilities. The authority to collect registration service fees is set to phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended. FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, establishes registration service fee amounts for different actions requested by applicants. The EPA sets fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants related to pesticide registration. Section 33 outlines fee schedules, timeframes for completion, fee reductions for small businesses, exemptions for certain applications, and restrictions on fee assessments based on appropriations. EPA is mandated to use collected fees for activities enhancing information systems capabilities. The EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations from FY2013 to FY2018. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and subject to annual appropriations. Fee receipts can be used for application review costs, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and pesticide-related expenses. The EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations from FY2013 to FY2018. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018, but the exact amount for pesticide program activities is not specified. The Inspector General of EPA must audit the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund annually, with findings reported to EPA and congressional committees. EPA is required to report on various aspects of its pesticide program activities annually. The EPA collects maintenance and registration service fees, which provide a significant portion of funding for its pesticide program activities. Congress has been working on reauthorizing the collection of these fees since 2017, with separate versions of legislation passed by the House and Senate. The House passed the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017, while the Senate passed an amendment to extend the collection authority. Both versions await reconciliation. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018 would reauthorize maintenance and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025, increase fee caps, allocate funds for expedited rulemaking and compliance monitoring, revise fee amounts and actions, and adjust time frames for EPA review. The Senate amendment would require EPA to implement two final rules by October 1. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would require EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, related to agricultural worker protection standards and certified pesticide applicators. It also authorizes EPA to propose revisions addressing application exclusion zones and directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on designated representatives by the same date. The House and Senate are in the process of reconciling differences in the reauthorization of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA). The House passed H.R. 2, which includes PRIA reauthorization, while the Senate's version does not. There is a history of bipartisan support for extending the pesticide fee framework, with recognition of various organizations involved in its development. However, the final enactment of the current PRIA reauthorization has not yet been achieved. The current PRIA reauthorization has not been finalized due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations."
