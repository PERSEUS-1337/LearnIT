    "content": "Following each decennial census, the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided among the 50 states, with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. Congressional district boundaries must be redrawn every 10 years to ensure equal population representation. The legal framework for redistricting involves constitutional and federal statutory requirements, with recent challenges invoking provisions like the Elections Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Equal Protection Clause and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ensure that redistricting maps comply with laws prohibiting discrimination based on race in voting practices. Congressional district boundaries must adhere to the Voting Rights Act's Section 2, which prohibits minority vote dilution and challenges discriminatory voting practices. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits any voting qualification or practice that denies the right to vote based on race, color, or language minority membership. It ensures equal opportunity for minority groups to participate in electoral processes, including redistricting plans. Before 2013, Section 5 required certain states to obtain preclearance for voting law changes to prevent discrimination. The Voting Rights Act, specifically Section 4(b), was invalidated by the Supreme Court in Shelby County, leading to the removal of preclearance requirements for nine states and jurisdictions within six additional states. This decision was based on the argument that the coverage formula was not justified in current conditions and violated the principle of equal sovereignty among states. The Supreme Court has evaluated disputes over redistricting maps in states like California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota. This has influenced how congressional districts are drawn, focusing on population equality, Voting Rights Act, partisan gerrymandering, and redistricting by independent commissions. The Court requires each congressional district to have an equal number of persons, known as the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote.\" In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. Sims that the one person, one vote standard applies to state legislative redistricting, ensuring equal voting rights. The Court has since clarified the requirement for population equality among districts, with a focus on the maximum population deviation. In redistricting, the Supreme Court has set standards for population equality among districts. For congressional districts, deviations from precise equality are held to a stricter standard than for state legislative districts. The Court has invalidated redistricting plans with significant population deviations, emphasizing the need for \"absolute\" population equality unless necessary for legitimate state objectives. These objectives can include achieving greater compactness, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbents. In Karcher, the Court rejected a 0.6984% deviation in population between districts. The 1983 Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission decision clarified that districts don't need precise mathematical equality but must justify population deviation with legitimate state objectives. The Court outlined a two-pronged test for redistricting plans: challengers must prove population differences could have been avoided, then the state must show the differences were needed for a legitimate state objective. The state's burden is flexible and depends on various factors. The Supreme Court upheld a 0.79% maximum population deviation between congressional districts in Tennant, citing valid state policies and the lack of alternative plans that better served the state's objectives. The Court's redistricting jurisprudence often deals with balancing the VRA's requirements and equal protection standards. Compliance with the VRA requires race awareness in redistricting, while the Equal Protection Clause prohibits redistricting based on race without justification. The Supreme Court has provided guidance on drawing district lines with race awareness to achieve a delicate balance. The VRA may require creating majority-minority districts to prevent vote denial based on race. Thornburg v. Gingles established a test for proving vote dilution under the VRA. The Supreme Court has outlined criteria for proving vote dilution under the VRA, including the need for geographically compact minority groups that are politically cohesive. The Court also considers the totality of circumstances, such as historical discrimination and the ability of minorities to elect candidates of their choice. The Supreme Court has outlined criteria for proving vote dilution under the VRA, including the need for geographically compact minority groups that are politically cohesive. Factors considered include racially polarized voting, discriminatory voting practices, access to candidate slating processes, effects of discrimination on education, employment, and health, racial appeals in political campaigns, and minority representation in public office. In Bartlett v. Strickland, the Court clarified that a minority group must be geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district to satisfy the first prong of the test. In Bartlett v. Strickland, the Supreme Court clarified that Section 2 of the VRA does not grant special protection to minority groups needing political coalitions to elect preferred candidates. The Court rejected the argument that minority voters can join with others to elect their choice if they comprise less than 50% of the voting age population in a district. The plurality opinion stated that recognizing Section 2 claims based on crossover majority voters would conflict with the Gingles test's requirement for the minority to demonstrate that the majority usually votes as a bloc to defeat their preferred candidate. In certain circumstances, Section 2 of the VRA may require the creation of majority-minority districts in congressional redistricting plans to prevent racial vote dilution. The Supreme Court has ruled that minority voters must make up over 50% in such districts. Additionally, redistricting plans must adhere to equal protection standards under the Fourteenth Amendment, with race being subject to strict scrutiny if it predominates over other redistricting considerations. To withstand strict scrutiny, the state must show a compelling interest in creating majority-minority districts that are narrowly tailored. These cases involve claims of \"racial gerrymandering\" where race was allegedly used improperly in redistricting. Plaintiffs must prove that racial considerations were dominant in creating the districts. For example, in Easley v. Cromartie in 2001, the Supreme Court upheld a 47% black district in North Carolina against claims of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. The Court determined that in cases of challenging majority-minority districts, the burden is on the challengers to prove that race, not politics, predominantly influenced the district boundaries. The Court emphasized the need to show alternative ways for the legislature to achieve its political objectives without relying on race. The challengers in this case failed to demonstrate that race was the primary factor in drawing the district boundaries. In a recent decision, the Court provided guidance on analyzing racial predominance in redistricting. The Court emphasized the need for a district-by-district analysis to determine if race was the predominant factor, rather than analyzing the state as a whole. It was clarified that traditional race-neutral redistricting principles should not be compared to the use of race in determining predominance. The Court highlighted the importance of examining which voters were moved based on race and whether the legislature prioritized racial considerations over other factors. The Alabama Court ruled that Section 5 of the VRA does not require a specific percentage of minority voters in a minority-majority district, but rather aims to maintain the ability of minorities to elect their preferred candidates. This decision is significant as it highlights the success of minority voters in challenging districts created under the VRA. The Supreme Court's clarification on racial predominance in redistricting in the Bethune-Hill case further adds to the understanding of racial gerrymandering claims. In Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, the Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs challenging a state legislative redistricting plan on racial gerrymandering grounds do not need to prove that the plan conflicts with traditional redistricting criteria. The case was remanded to the federal district court to determine the permissibility of 11 out of the 12 \"majority-minority\" districts created by Virginia in 2011. The Virginia legislature redrew its districts after the 2010 census, ensuring compliance with the Voting Rights Act by creating districts with a black voting-age population of at least 55%. In Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, the Supreme Court clarified that proving a conflict with traditional redistricting criteria is not a mandatory requirement for establishing a claim of racial gerrymandering. Virginia argued that racial predominance is not proven if a redistricting map could have been drawn according to traditional criteria, but the Court disagreed, citing precedent that racial gerrymandering can occur even without a conflict with traditional criteria. The Supreme Court emphasized that the key issue in racial gerrymandering cases is the \"racial purpose of state action, not its stark manifestation.\" The Court is currently reviewing Cooper v. Harris, a case involving the unconstitutional racial gerrymandering of North Carolina's congressional district map in 2011. The map included two new majority-minority districts, but was deemed a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In 2013, plaintiffs filed suit in federal court, alleging North Carolina packed African-American voters into Congressional Districts 1 and 12 to reduce their influence in other districts, constituting unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. The district court found race predominated in creating both districts, applying strict scrutiny and determining insufficient evidence to justify District 1's creation for VRA compliance. The court found that the state failed to prove racially polarized voting in Congressional District 1 and invalidated District 12 for lacking a compelling interest in using race in redistricting. While the Voting Rights Act may require majority-minority districts in certain cases, redistricting maps must also adhere to equal protection standards. The Supreme Court requires a compelling governmental interest in creating majority-minority districts, with a narrowly tailored redistricting plan. Recent case law emphasizes a district-by-district analysis for racial predominance. Challengers of racial gerrymandering do not need to show conflict with traditional redistricting criteria. The Court is reviewing a case on unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. Partisan gerrymandering is defined as drawing district lines to benefit one party over another. The Supreme Court has struggled to establish a standard for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. In the 2004 case of Vieth v. Jubelirer, the Court addressed a claim of partisan gerrymandering but could not agree on a standard for assessing such claims. Some Justices argued that such claims are non-justiciable political questions, while others believed they are justiciable but could not decide on a standard. In the case of Vieth v. Jubelirer, Justice Kennedy suggested that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering could potentially be addressed through the First Amendment, focusing on protecting citizens' electoral participation and political expression. This approach contrasts with an Equal Protection Clause analysis, which emphasizes the permissibility of redistricting classifications. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, Justice Kennedy proposed addressing partisan gerrymandering claims through the First Amendment, focusing on protecting electoral participation and political expression. This contrasts with an Equal Protection Clause analysis that examines the permissibility of redistricting classifications. In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (\"LULAC\"), the Court was divided on whether partisan gerrymandering claims are subject to judicial review. In LULAC, the Supreme Court debated the justiciability of claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, with no clear standard agreed upon. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito aligned with Justice Kennedy's position, leaving open the possibility of a future standard. The critical standard for adjudicating unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering claims remains unresolved. In February 2017, Wisconsin appealed a federal court ruling on partisan gerrymandering to the Supreme Court. The court found the state legislative redistricting map unconstitutional due to favoring the Republican Party. Voters challenged the plan for unequal treatment. The Wisconsin state legislative redistricting plan was found to treat voters unequally based on their political beliefs, violating the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee and burdening their First Amendment rights. The district court ruled that drawing a redistricting map to impede a citizen's vote based on political affiliation is unconstitutional. The court emphasized that the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause safeguard a citizen's vote from discrimination based on political preferences. The court found a \"solid basis\" for considering the associational aspect of the plaintiff's claim of partisan gerrymandering, stating that state laws place burdens on the rights of individuals to associate for political beliefs and the right of qualified voters to cast their votes effectively. The redistricting plan was determined to aim at securing the Republican Party's control of the state legislature, despite the availability of less partisan alternatives. The court found that the redistricting plan aimed to entrench one party in control of the legislature for a 10-year period by increasing districts favoring a political party. The plan ensured that one party would maintain over 50% of seats in any election scenario, using a new measure called the \"efficiency gap.\" The Efficiency Gap (EG) is a measure that represents the difference between wasted votes of parties in an election, measuring cracking and packing of voters. It does not require proportional seat distribution but measures deviation from expected relationships in a redistricting plan. The court relied on academic analyses, 2012 and 2014 election results, and the Efficiency Gap (EG) measure to show that the state legislative redistricting plan burdened the plaintiffs' representational rights. The court found that the plan's discriminatory effect was not justified by political geography or a legitimate state interest, and concluded that considering the EG to assess partisan gerrymandering was appropriate. The court found the Wisconsin state legislative redistricting plan to be an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, as the drafters had alternative plans with less partisan advantage but chose not to use them. The court ordered the state to enact a new plan by November 1, 2017, for the November 2018 election. The Supreme Court has been unable to establish a clear standard for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Some states have implemented independent redistricting commissions to address concerns about partisan gerrymandering, such as Arizona and California. These commissions are responsible for drawing congressional and state legislative districts, removing control from the state legislatures. In a 2015 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Arizona's independent commission. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an independent commission for drawing congressional district boundaries, ruling that the Elections Clause allows for a commission to draw districts instead of a state legislature. The Court emphasized that the term \"legislature\" in the Clause does not restrict redistricting power solely to the state's representative body. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause does not limit redistricting power to the state legislature, allowing for an independent commission to draw congressional districts. The term \"legislature\" varies in meaning depending on context, as seen in previous Court cases. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause does not limit redistricting power to the state legislature, allowing for an independent commission to draw congressional districts. The Court found no constitutional barrier to states empowering their people with a legislative function through initiatives, in line with the Constitution's principle that the people are the source of governmental power. Additionally, the Court held that Arizona's congressional redistricting process complies with federal redistricting statutes. Congress intended for states to have full authority to create congressional districts using their own laws and regulations, including initiatives. The Supreme Court clarified that states can use the initiative process to enact laws affecting congressional elections, as seen in the case of Arizona State Legislature allowing for an independent commission to draw district boundaries. This ruling suggests that states, like California, can establish similar initiatives for redistricting. The U.S. Supreme Court's rulings have shaped congressional redistricting processes, allowing states to establish initiative-based provisions like Arizona State Legislature did. Congressional redistricting is governed by federal statutes and constitutional limits, with the Court requiring districts to have roughly equal populations but allowing deviations for valid state reasons. The Voting Rights Act may also impact district creation. The Supreme Court has set standards for congressional redistricting, requiring equal populations in districts and allowing deviations for valid state reasons. The Court also requires a compelling governmental interest for creating majority-minority districts, with strict scrutiny applied if race is the predominant factor in redistricting. The Court is currently considering cases on racial considerations in district lines and partisan gerrymandering, with a potential to establish a standard for unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Additionally, a 2015 ruling affirmed states' authority under the Elections Clause to regulate elections. In 2015, a Supreme Court ruling allowed states to create nonpartisan independent commissions for drawing congressional districts through ballot initiatives and referenda."
