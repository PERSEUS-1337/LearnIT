    "content": "The President signed H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, with $59.2 billion in spending for war costs, disaster assistance, Haiti relief, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House receding from an amended version. The enacted version includes $58.8 billion in new Budget Authority, with rescissions and mandatory savings offsetting previous spending. The House debated H.Con.Res. 301, which required the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days. The resolution was defeated. The Senate disagreed with the House version of the bill, leading to a failed cloture vote on H.R. 4899. The House dropped its support for the bill adding $22.5 billion for various purposes and adopted the Senate version of H.R. 4899, which included $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and new benefits for Vietnam veterans. The debate revolved around additional domestic spending proposals. The debate on H.R. 4899 focused on whether additional domestic spending proposals were emergencies that did not require offsets and the likelihood of success of the new war policy in Afghanistan. Representative David Obey introduced the Senate version of the bill, adding funds for FEMA disaster funding, war funding, and other emergencies like teacher job losses and Pell fund shortfalls. He opposed the bill due to concerns about Afghanistan and Pakistan's support for the war. Afghanistan and Pakistan did not support the war, and Congress did not adopt a proposed House amendment for a vote on continuing the policy. Representative Obey believed the process should move forward. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending on troops and urged support for the bill. Other members supported DOD's war funding and disability benefits for Vietnam veterans. Representative Skelton supported the bill, while Representative McGovern raised concerns about corruption in the Afghan government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. The House debated funding for the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with concerns raised about funding running out in August. A resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw troops from Pakistan was defeated. The Senate also failed to adopt cloture on the issue. The Senate failed to adopt cloture on the House version of H.R. 4899, which appropriated $59.2 billion in spending, $5.0 billion below the request. Key funding allocations included $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, $13.4 billion for Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, and $30.8 billion for the Department of Defense war-related funding. Differences from the Administration's request included $3.8 billion for war-related foreign aid vs. $4.5 billion requested. In the final version of H.R. 4899, Congress did not include additional domestic funding for various purposes that were not requested by the Administration, such as preventing teacher layoffs, providing more Pell grants, funding summer jobs, and agricultural and energy grants. Additionally, Congress added $600 million in foreign aid and humanitarian assistance for Mexico, Jordan, El Salvador, Vietnam, and Congo, as well as $400 million for flood and drought relief. The final bill also did not include $600 million for border security and $129 million to reduce patent backlogs in the Commerce Department, which were requested by the Administration after the Senate bill was passed. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 includes $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for Afghan and Iraq wars. $31.5 billion is for the Afghan war, with $29.8 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. $2.7 billion is for the Iraq war, with $1.0 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. Total funding for Afghan and Iraq wars in FY2010 is $169.9 billion, including $104.4 billion for Afghan war and $65.5 billion for Iraq war. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 provided $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for Afghan and Iraq wars. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010, with the House passing H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for disaster relief and $600 million for summer jobs program, and the Senate passing H.R. 4899 with $59.2 billion for various purposes including war funding, foreign assistance, and disaster relief. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 provided $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for Afghan and Iraq wars. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010, with the House passing H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for disaster relief and $600 million for summer jobs program, and the Senate passing H.R. 4899 with $59.2 billion for various purposes including war funding, foreign assistance, and disaster relief. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010, with a total of $81.8 billion in spending, funded with $65.1 billion in new BA and $16.7 billion in rescissions and mandatory savings. The FY2010 supplemental requests included $5.1 billion for disaster relief, $33.0 billion for the Defense Department, $4.5 billion for foreign assistance, $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, $243 million for responses to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, $600 million for border security, and $3.4 billion to settle land trust claims of American Indians and $1.2 billion to settle discrimination claims of black farmers. The Senate and House considered the effect of this spending on the federal deficit. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 4899 included different amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings to offset proposed spending on the federal deficit. The House bill had $600 million in offsets for $5.7 billion in spending, while the Senate version had $380 million for $59.3 billion. The amended House bill included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings for $81.8 billion in proposed spending. Congressional rules require spending to fit within discretionary and mandatory totals unless designated as emergencies. The final version of H.R. 4899 designated almost all of the $45.8 billion in discretionary spending as emergency, exempting it from budget caps. The President's supplemental request included $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending. Emergency supplemental appropriations are criticized for bypassing budgetary discipline. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as undermining budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on overall discretionary spending. Congress must decide if the emergency designation is appropriate, with supplementals receiving less scrutiny than regular appropriations. Concerns arise about the impact of this additional spending on the deficit, leading to debates on increasing spending above appropriated levels and whether to offset the deficit through cuts or increased revenues. Congress considered the FY2010 supplemental appropriations request within budget constraints set by the FY2010 budget resolution and other rules. Spending could be exempted by designating it as an emergency or for overseas deployments. Waivers could also be used to bypass budget rules, but emergency designations could still be subject to a point of order. During consideration of H.R. 4899 in 2010, various agencies and plaintiffs highlighted deadlines for supplemental funding needed. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund due to insufficient funding for response operations within two weeks. The Coast Guard warned that they could reach the $150 million annual cap on the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund by June 18, 2010, which would hinder their response operations. To address this, Congress passed a bill raising the cap to $1 billion specifically for the Deepwater Horizon Spill, allowing funds to be withdrawn in increments and reported to Congress. Additionally, the Department of Defense received a significant increase in war funding in bridge funds included in its regular appropriations acts. In early May, Secretary of Defense Gates requested an additional $33 billion for 30,000 troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover war operations through August 2010 based on current funding. Secretary Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding and urged passage by July 4 to avoid disrupting other programs. In mid-July, DOD press spokesman Geoff Morrell warned that the Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August. Under Secretary of the Army, Joseph Westphal, testified that the Army had funds through mid-August but may need reprogramming. The services had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts, with the Army having $15.3 billion. The Army and Air Force received $2.2 billion for war funding. Monthly spending increased by 20% from April 2010 as more troops arrived. The Army and Marine Corps relied on already appropriated war bridge funds through August. Services tapped base budget funding to finance war temporarily. FEMA limited funds for claims to make Disaster Relief Fund last longer. FEMA estimated the Disaster Relief Fund would become insolvent by the end of June 2010, but as of June 7, 2010, they had a balance of $952 million. The funds were available due to a policy to pay only for immediate needs or life-threatening situations. Despite a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects, the funds could last through August 2010. The State Department needed funding replenished by June 1, 2010, to respond to future humanitarian crises. Congress did not approve the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline to settle the Pigford II court case for black farmers. The deadline for the Cobell suit settlement is August 6, 2010, with uncertainty about further extensions. Members of Congress raised concerns about evaluating spending on the Afghan War and ensuring effective use of foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) due to anticipated fund shortage by May or June 2010. FEMA sent guidance in February 2010 to limit expenditures to avoid running out of funds. In response to a potential fund shortage, FEMA limited payments to arbitration awards and immediate needs, delaying other projects like mitigation work. Congress questioned FEMA's budgeting practices and delays in requesting disaster relief funds, raising concerns about the agency's arguments for low funds. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices in its FY2010 request. The Obama Administration requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2010, but Congress only provided $1.6 billion. In FY2011, the Administration requested $1.9 billion for the DRF, citing the need for additional funding due to numerous disasters. Some argue that higher funding levels are necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. The Obama Administration requested funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2010 and FY2011, with Congress providing less than requested. FEMA's current request for $5.1 billion for the DRF lacks detailed justification, with only one example cited. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided the requested funding, including a stipulation for a transfer of $5 million to the Department of Homeland Security Office. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $396 million for disaster relief funding for various incidents, including floods, fishery disasters, tornado damages, and Gulf Coast hurricanes. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the delay in providing information on funding requirements. Additionally, other agencies received funding for disaster relief activities, such as $100 million for Housing and Urban Development and $227 million for the Army Corps of Engineers. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $396 million for disaster relief funding for various incidents, including floods, fishery disasters, tornado damages, and Gulf Coast hurricanes. The Army Corps of Engineers receives $227 million for repair and recovery projects, while FEMA is directed to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood maps updates. Additionally, the DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding for troop deployment to Afghanistan and economic assistance for military operations. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for troop deployment to Afghanistan in FY2010 to reverse the security situation, target the insurgency, secure population centers, and train Afghan forces. By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remaining 4,000 expected by September 2010. The goal is to transfer responsibility to the Afghans by July 2011, with a total of 98,000 troops deployed by fall. In response to requests from the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, troop levels in Afghanistan increased to 98,000 by fall 2010, with plans for a total of 148,000 foreign troops and 243,000 Afghan security forces. NATO allies also increased troop levels to 48,000 by March 2010. The FY2011 budget includes an additional 4,000 support troops for Afghanistan. The Defense Department requested $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, $1 billion for Iraq Security Forces training, and $2 billion for fuel costs. Total war spending in FY2010 increased to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The total budget for Afghanistan and Iraq in FY2010 was almost the same as the FY2011 request. Total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War reached $314.1 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental. The enacted total for Iraq was $706.2 billion with the Supplemental, and could reach $752 billion with the FY2011 request. President Obama's new strategy in Afghanistan includes a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011, with a review in December 2010. However, Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen have indicated that the timeline could slip, and the drawdown in July 2011 may be minor. They emphasized that the transition is a process based on conditions on the ground, with Secretary Gates suggesting it could take several years. General Petraeus described the initiative as an 18-month campaign, to be evaluated in eighteen months. Members of Congress expressed concerns about the timing and length of the new campaign in Afghanistan, with evaluations set for September 2011. During the consideration of H.R. 4899, three amendments were debated and rejected, aiming to increase congressional involvement in decision-making regarding U.S. military commitment. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment No. 4 suggested limiting DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required a new National Intelligence Estimate and a timetable for troop redeployment. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan, $1 billion for Iraqi Security Forces training, and $2 billion for higher fuel prices. The funding for Afghanistan covered various costs such as military operations, force protection, Afghan security forces training, fuel costs, and equipment reconstitution. The campaign in Marjah and plans for Kandahar were key concerns, with mixed reports on Taliban presence in Marjah and delays in the Kandahar campaign. The DOD's budget includes funding for reconstitution of war-worn equipment, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. Different functional categories show varying funding increases for activities in Afghanistan between FY2009 and FY2011. The DOD's estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan differ from CBO's estimates. The per troop cost is $875,000 according to DOD, almost double CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same monthly troop strength, with DOD attributing higher costs to setting up facilities in southern Afghanistan. In 2009, concerns about accurately budgeting for Afghan and Iraq wars led to transferring $5 billion from DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding to OCOTF. DOD's FY2010 request may be high as obligations for operational costs in FY2010 are only 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to double to use all funds, indicating DOD's estimates may be high. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund. Concerns were raised about the need for all the funds and the achievability of the plan due to current spending rates and oversight issues. The plan aimed to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011, with significant growth in the Afghan Army and Police as well. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. In January 2010, NATO partners endorsed the DOD's request for an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund. Concerns were raised about the need for all the funds and the achievability of the plan. The total amount appropriated for Afghan Security Forces so far is $25.5 billion, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total through FY2011 to $39.8 billion. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. The training of Afghan Security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. Both the DOD and the State Department have faced numerous challenges in this training, including high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, logistical limitations, and questionable behavior. Afghan police training has been hindered by issues such as illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents on recruits and police officers. Coordination problems between DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition training efforts, as well as issues with private contractors, have been highlighted in various reports and hearings. The DOD and State Department face challenges in training Afghan Security forces, including high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, and logistical limitations. Issues with private contractors include poor performance, unauthorized firearm use, and inadequate vetting. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, with only 44% of required trainers currently assigned. Members may want to know how many trainers are needed and how the requirement will be met in terms of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractor personnel. The DOD faces challenges in training Afghan Security forces, including high attrition rates and leadership deficiencies. Concerns were raised about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010. The DOD had funds available for FY2010, with concerns raised about the justification for emergency war supplementals. Some argue that the additional funding request is appropriate due to unforeseen troop deployments. Congressional decision on emergency designation is crucial. Requests for training, fuel offset, and war-worn equipment replacement were highlighted. The $2 billion for fuel increases and $1.7 billion for war-worn equipment reset may not be directly related to new deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation. Congress is hesitant to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of security responsibility to the Iraqi government and rising oil prices. DOD argues that $1 billion for ISFF is necessary for modernization efforts in Iraq. Some may challenge the emergency designation of these funds. DOD typically covers unexpected fuel cost increases using Working Capital Funds or by transferring funds from less urgent needs. An infusion of budget authority is needed for actions related to the additional 30,000 troops. $1.7 billion is requested for war-worn equipment reset. Predicting the need for equipment replacement due to the gradual impact of combat operations in Afghanistan is challenging. DOD has a backlog of war-related procurement to be spent. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, with adjustments made for excess funding in certain accounts and combat losses. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments to DOD's funding request, such as rejecting $350 million for unspecified requirements and cutting $400 million for Army force protection programs. It also increased procurement accounts by $512 million for combat losses. The final version of the bill approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces but dropped a provision for base closure transportation improvements. The Administration's supplemental request included $529 million for military construction. The supplemental request for military construction included $521 million for Afghanistan and $8 million for Air Force family housing utilities. Questions arise about the purpose of the construction in Afghanistan, with concerns over permanent bases. The request aims to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops with infrastructure improvements. The supplemental request for military construction in Afghanistan included $521 million for the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops. The construction aims to expand airfield capacity, increase logistics capacity, and provide necessary infrastructure in key locations. Army projects are focused in southern provinces like Helmand, Nimruz, and Kandahar, while Air Force construction is planned for provinces like Nimruz, Balkh, and Herand to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command headquarters at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tombstone near Lashkar Gah. The military construction in Afghanistan includes perimeter security facilities, helicopter aprons, runways, and aircraft aprons at various locations across the country. Congress has expressed concerns about long-term U.S. troop commitment and has implemented measures to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in Afghanistan. In FY2010, Congress banned the use of defense funds to establish permanent military installations in Afghanistan, with an exception allowing the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for long-term presence support. No clear definition of permanency projects was provided. In FY2010, Congress banned defense funds for permanent military installations in Afghanistan, allowing Operation & Maintenance funds for long-term presence support. The line between banned and permitted projects is unclear, with some projects potentially supporting either purpose. Congress has denied funds for projects signaling a permanent presence without comprehensive justification. DOD had flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary facilities from FY2004 to FY2009. In response to the likelihood of a continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Congress permitted the use of O&M funds for construction projects in U.S. Central Command and Afghanistan, with a total limit of $500 million. This increased the amount spent on military construction significantly, with $409 million added from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan in FY2009. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan to the $900 million appropriated, raising the total to $1.4 billion. This nearly equaled the entire amount spent on construction between FY2003 and FY2008. DOD's construction investment in Afghanistan doubled in a single year. If DOD dedicates the full $500 million in O&M available for military construction in Afghanistan in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion, almost doubling the prior seven-year investment. DOD has submitted a new legislative proposal to use O&M monies for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012. Total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could rise further if the FY2011 proposal is approved by Congress. Key bases in Afghanistan have received significant investments, including $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base and a requested $248 million for a total of $1.6 billion if approved. The Department of Defense has requested $767 million for Kandahar Air Base, $181 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion, and $299 million for unspecified minor military construction projects. The proposal includes a new authority to use O&M funds for construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would allow unlimited spending on such projects with a raised cap from $750,000 to $3 million per project. The Department of Defense proposed a new authority to use O&M funds for construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. DOD requested $521 million in supplemental funds, raising questions about the urgency of the request given the current spending rates for military construction projects in Afghanistan. DOD had $2.1 billion in budget authority available from previous appropriation acts that had not yet been obligated. The Department of Defense needs to increase its monthly obligations significantly to spend the $2.1 billion in funds available by the end of the fiscal year. This includes $700 million that must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and another $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. To spend all the FY2009 funds before they expire, DOD would need to quadruple its current monthly obligation rate to $100 million. Similarly, to spend the $1.4 billion available for FY2010 projects, monthly obligations would need to average $116 million. With additional supplemental funds, monthly obligations would have to triple from the FY2009 rate to $150 million a month. The FY2011 war request included $657 million for military construction/family housing, with $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The Senate added $127.5 million to accelerate Air Force projects funded through O&M monies. Military construction funds would be available for two years until September 30, 2011. The final version of the bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, totaling $4.46 billion. The FY2010 Supplemental request for war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated for State Department programs and $2.6 billion for Foreign Operations. The request did not include funding for certain accounts like P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival. The enacted version increased total funding to $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over FY2009, with $3.7 billion allocated for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations. The FY2010 Supplemental request for war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated for State Department programs and $2.6 billion for Foreign Operations. The enacted version increased total funding to $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over FY2009, with $3.7 billion allocated for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations. The Administration's international affairs State, Foreign Operations request for Afghanistan emphasized civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services, in conjunction with U.S. military efforts. The strategy aimed to strengthen the U.S. civilian presence, increase aid to local government, and enhance the role of the national government in providing local services. The surge strategy in December 2009 accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery, focusing on creating jobs and providing social services through a more capable Afghan government. The Afghanistan supplemental request aimed to boost U.S. international affairs funding levels for the country, addressing concerns about corruption hindering effective service delivery. The increase in aid personnel and oversight measures reflect worries about the impact of corruption on aid programs. P.L. 111-212 significantly raised aid and State support to Afghanistan, emphasizing civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services. The FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account received a significant increase in funding, with a rise of nearly 90% above the previous year's level. The foreign aid portion of the supplemental request aimed to raise total FY2010 levels of civilian aid accounts going to Afghanistan by 67%. The Administration sought funds for Economic Support, International Narcotics, and Diplomatic Programs to support Afghanistan's economic, political, and social development. The FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account received a significant increase in funding, with a rise of nearly 90% above the previous year's level. The foreign aid portion of the supplemental request aimed to raise total FY2010 levels of civilian aid accounts going to Afghanistan by 67%. The Administration sought funds for various sectors in Afghanistan, including agriculture, conflict mitigation, rule of law, good governance, health, education, macroeconomic growth, trade and investment, financial sector, and agriculture. The FY2010 State Department requested funding for various sectors in Afghanistan, including agriculture, private sector development, economic opportunity, justice sector support, and counter-narcotics programs. The funding included capacity building in the Ministry of Agriculture, watershed rehabilitation, irrigation, agriculture credit, extension services, market development, Islamic-compliant financing, rule of law activities, corrections program expansion, model prisons, increasing judges and prosecutors, counternarcotics police support, and drug treatment facilities. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) request of $211 million aimed to expand civilian personnel in international affairs assistance programs. The proposal included a 457 position increase, hiring U.S. direct hires for district-level work and staff for Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The \"whole of government\" approach involved federal employees from various agencies providing specialized expertise. Additionally, about 200 locally employed staff were to support American personnel in the field. The report praised management and personnel at the U.S. embassy in Kabul but expressed concerns about their overwork due to a tripling of staff. The proposed expansion would strain resources, impacting staff management, housing, and security needs. Additional funding was requested for oversight programs. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, cutting the ESF request by $267 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends specific funding levels for various program sectors within the ESF account, notably reducing good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. Concerns were raised about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan, leading to limitations on direct government budget support to $100 million. Additionally, the INCLE account was cut by $31 million due to doubts about the political will in Afghanistan to reform the justice system. The request for SIGAR was rejected for oversight reasons. The enacted legislation for Afghanistan aid includes conditions such as consulting with Afghan government representatives, measuring progress with benchmarks, and ensuring cooperation in reform efforts. Aid is contingent on respecting human rights, removing corrupt officials, and ensuring the Electoral Commission is free from fraud involvement. The enacted legislation for Afghanistan aid includes conditions such as consulting with Afghan government representatives, measuring progress with benchmarks, and ensuring cooperation in reform efforts. Aid is contingent on respecting human rights, removing corrupt officials, and ensuring the Electoral Commission is free from fraud involvement. Additionally, H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million in funding to be transferred for activities supporting U.S. civilian security in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The U.S. assistance program to Iraq in FY2010 saw a significant increase in aid and State Department operations following the drawdown of U.S. military forces. The FY2010 U.S. assistance program to Iraq saw a 89% increase in economic aid programs compared to the previous year. The State Department will take over police training responsibilities from the Department of Defense, with a $517.4 million request for INCLE funds to facilitate the transition. The FY2010 U.S. assistance program in Iraq included a significant boost in funding for civilian outreach and security infrastructure. The program aimed to deploy 350 advisors to work with the Iraqi military, fund necessary infrastructure, and employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel. Additionally, funding was allocated for State Department operational costs under the D&CP account. This increase in funding was necessary to maintain civilian outreach to the provinces following the U.S. military drawdown, with over 1,200 direct-hire American employees stationed in Iraq. Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) were established during the 2007 surge to support U.S. economic interests, provide political analysis, and oversee government assistance programs in Iraq. As combat battalions withdraw, embedded PRTs are being phased out, with regular PRTs expected to end by 2011. To maintain a civilian presence, the State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams outside of Baghdad. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams in Iraq, with funding for infrastructure realignment and security requirements. The Department will assume responsibilities previously held by the military, including utilities, housing, and security costs. The Department of Defense will transfer responsibilities for housing, protecting, and maintaining staff to contract employees in Iraq. There are concerns about the Department's ability to manage and oversee these contracts effectively. H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than requested, with cuts to diplomatic operations funding. The Senate appropriators suggested prioritizing funds for site development and construction of consulates in Iraq. The enacted H.R. 4899 increased funding for INCLE by $133 million, reconfiguring the use of funds for police training. The Pakistan supplemental request showed no significant change in U.S. policy. Funding for Pakistan would see only a modest shift between FY2009 and FY2011. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan aimed at specific infrastructure needs to show continued U.S. support. The largest portion of the request was for $244 million in ESF, including funds for cash payments, water and sanitation, agriculture irrigation, and energy solutions. Additionally, $40 million in INCLE funds were allocated for police training and related infrastructure. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $60 million for Foreign Military Financing to provide helicopters for counterinsurgency operations, and $26 million for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan. This increase in staffing aimed to better manage military and economic assistance, enhance logistical support, and increase staffing at U.S. consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, with increased staffing at U.S. consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar. Additional funds were allocated for human rights and programs assisting families affected by military operations. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti after the devastating earthquake. Approximately 55% of the funds were for relief activities, 40% for recovery and reconstruction, and 6% for diplomatic operations. The earthquake was considered one of the most devastating catastrophes in history, affecting around 3 million people in Haiti. Approximately 3 million people in Haiti have been affected by the earthquake, with over 2 million displaced. The government reports 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The relief effort is expected to last for months. Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries by the United Nations. Protection of the displaced population is a critical issue, with up to 1.69 million displaced in Port-au-Prince and 597,000 in other poverty-stricken areas. Some Haitians have left as refugees to neighboring countries. Aid workers are providing basic necessities to Internally Displaced Populations. The focus is on delivering emergency shelter and sanitation to displaced Haitians, with a total recovery and reconstruction needs of $11.5 billion. International donors pledged nearly $10 billion for reconstruction efforts, with the U.S. pledging $1.2 billion. Improved accountability of donor assistance is emphasized to enhance aid effectiveness and reduce corruption. The government of Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development helped establish an online monitoring system. H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, with funds allocated for relief activities, recovery, and reconstruction. The total requested for relief and disaster assistance funding was $1.5 billion. The $1.5 billion humanitarian relief funding request for Haiti included funds for various U.S. government agencies and ongoing relief activities. President Obama announced an additional $100 million in assistance, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian funding for Haiti to over $1.1 billion as of June 2010. The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance. The $1.5 billion humanitarian relief funding request for Haiti included $126.6 million for USAID to reimburse other U.S. government agencies for earthquake relief. The IDA funding also covered ongoing humanitarian assistance activities, coordination programs, logistics, shelter programs, health and nutrition programs, and water and sanitation programs in Haiti. The funding request for Haiti included programs for health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and child protection. It also allocated funds for emergency food assistance, with a focus on supporting vulnerable populations and food-for-work programs. Relief operations in Haiti are expected to continue through 2010, with activities addressing both humanitarian concerns and reconstruction efforts. The international community, led by the United Nations and the United States, has been actively providing significant humanitarian assistance in response to the natural disasters that have struck Haiti in the last decade. The focus is on overcoming the cycle of disaster, developing disaster response capacity, and sustaining reconstruction efforts. The United States is a major contributor to relief efforts in humanitarian disasters, with bipartisan congressional support for humanitarian assistance. Disaster accounts are being drawn down to provide relief to Haiti, with the State Department reporting on the ongoing efforts. The disaster accounts are being drawn down to provide relief to Haiti, with a deadline for replenishment by June 1, 2010. The United Nations has put forward a Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti amounting to $1.44 billion. As of June 4, 2010, commitments of $874 million had been received. It is unclear whether donor amounts represent pledges or specific obligations, and funds committed may not necessarily be new contributions. The actual costs of the Haiti disaster and how they will be shared among stakeholders remain to be seen. The Haiti disaster relief efforts face challenges in sustaining donor interest and honoring pledges. Criticisms of slow aid delivery and bureaucratic red tape persist. Evaluations of the relief response continue amid concerns about the Haitian government's capacity and coordination issues. The Haiti disaster relief efforts face challenges in sustaining donor interest and honoring pledges, with criticisms of slow aid delivery and bureaucratic red tape persisting. The response includes requests for funding from the DOD and U.S. Coast Guard for humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti, covering expenses already incurred and providing soldier subsistence, operational support, and humanitarian relief supplies. The DOD's response to the Haitian earthquake was rapid and extensive, involving over 20,000 U.S. military personnel in transporting emergency relief supplies, evacuating people, providing security, and making repairs. The earthquake response mission ended in June 2010, but further assistance will be provided through the \"New Horizons\" annual humanitarian exercise. This exercise will involve about 500 National Guard and Reserve soldiers in engineering projects such as building schools, clinics, and community facilities. The U.S. military was involved in various engineering projects in Haiti, including constructing schools, clinics, and community centers that can serve as hurricane shelters. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima provided medical assistance and performed surgeries in the Port de Paix area. Concerns were raised about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces and the capabilities of Haitian security forces and U.N. security personnel. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities account to fund U.S. contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. After the earthquake, MINUSTAH increased military personnel from 6,940 to 8,940 and police from 2,211 to 3,711. The Security Council raised the police component by 680 to 4,391. The Administration requested $256.2 million for HHS activities in Haiti, with $220.0 million directly to HHS and $36.2 million to USAID for interagency agreements. The funding would support Medicaid and other relief efforts. The request for supplemental funds includes four types of activities related to Medicaid, CHIP, medical evacuations, and public health activities in Haiti. The funding allocation for each activity was not specified, and there were no proposed changes in eligibility for assistance or benefits. The funds would cover the state share of Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible evacuees, including Haitians with humanitarian parole status. The requested funds would be used for medical evacuation of seriously injured earthquake victims to the United States, their care in U.S. hospitals for 30 days, and providing cash and medical assistance to Haitian humanitarian parolees. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) will reimburse hospitals for the costs of care for evacuated individuals, regardless of citizenship. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in HHS partially funds the federal resettlement assistance program for refugees and entrants, including transitional cash and medical assistance. The ORR provides funding for transitional cash and medical assistance to states through the Transition and Medical Services program. Haitian parolees who meet certain eligibility requirements may receive benefits under the ORR-funded Refugee Cash Assistance and Refugee Medical Assistance programs. The requested funds would support public health activities in Haiti, including disease surveillance and reestablishment of laboratory capacity. Additionally, funds would cover medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. U.S. disaster assistance to other nations typically does not involve accepting large numbers of disaster victims into the United States. The use of NDMS for airlifting Haitian earthquake victims into the United States required rapid policy development. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for USCIS to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants. USCIS funds its operations through fees charged for adjudications and services, including those for refugees and applicants for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). USCIS has a budget authority of $2.727 billion for FY2010, with $2.503 billion coming from fees collected. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 provided $224 million in direct appropriations to USCIS, including $50 million for processing refugee applications and asylum claims. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $1.6 billion in humanitarian assistance, with an additional $110 million for Haiti relief activities. The enacted version of the relief activities includes $460 million, matching the Administration's request for $150 million for food assistance in Haiti. It also approves $655 million for the Department of Defense, with a transfer of $255 million from the OHDACA account. Additionally, $96.5 million is endorsed for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities in Haiti, and $220 million is approved for services to Haitian evacuees and migrants. Recovery and Reconstruction funding in the supplemental proposal totaled $1.1 billion. The 111th Congress expressed bipartisan support for providing Haiti with substantial assistance in response to the crisis generated by the January earthquake. Members stressed the need for a coordinated international effort for immediate humanitarian needs and long-term development. U.S. programs in the supplemental focus on urgent infrastructure repairs, critical health care, governance, and security. Observers have raised concerns about neglecting areas like improving the educational system. The revised Haitian development strategy, supported by the supplemental request, aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince to address the urban-rural imbalance in the country. Funds in the request target short- and long-term elements of decentralization, including meeting immediate needs of displaced populations and strengthening local governance and infrastructure. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development. Officials support selecting less vulnerable areas for development in Haiti, but note the high cost of developing neglected areas. There are concerns about forcibly relocating populations and the need for targeted poverty reduction programs. Aid should focus on building Haitian capacity, but there is tension between efficiency and the time and funding required for capacity building. Aid organizations operate on short-term contracts and may need more time and resources for effective capacity building. The supplemental proposal requests $749 million in Economic Support Funds for Haiti. The supplemental proposal requested $749 million in Economic Support Funds for International Assistance programs in Haiti until September 30, 2012. The focus was on rehabilitating infrastructure, providing technical assistance to the Haitian government, and working on reconstruction projects for essential services like shelter, water, sanitation, healthcare, and electricity. Additionally, funds could be transferred to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti and USAID's Operating Expenses account for staffing needs. Some experts suggest developing small-scale, alternative energy sources at the local level in Haiti to improve quality of life and economic growth. Concerns have been raised about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support. The State Department would receive $144 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities in Haiti to enhance security. Funding would strengthen law enforcement by purchasing equipment and adding police advisors for MINUSTAH. The INCLE funds requested would strengthen the Haiti National Police by restoring training capacity, providing equipment, supplies, and infrastructure, and re-building prisons destroyed by the earthquake. Other programs aim to enhance criminal justice sector support, counter-narcotics operations, and combat human trafficking. Additionally, funding is requested for the Office of the Inspector General of USAID to improve accountability and oversight, and reduce corruption in relief and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The Administration requested up to $120 million in Economic Support Funds for a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to aid Haiti's recovery from the earthquake. Haitian President and Prime Minister acknowledged limited capacities post-earthquake. A development authority is being established for long-term development. The Administration proposed $252 million to cancel Haiti's debts to international organizations. Up to $40 million may be reallocated from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, with additional funding for multilateral debt relief. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires clear agreements and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse, with possible suspension if conditions are not met. Restrictions and reporting requirements are imposed on recovery and reconstruction funding categories. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $770 million for Economic Support Funds (ESF) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) for Haiti. Funding is contingent on Haitian government involvement in program design and execution, as well as reforms to address corruption. No funding for justice programs until investigation into extrajudicial killings is completed. Haitian judiciary system's capacity for investigations is weak. Administration's request did not include funding for education programs. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $10 million for children's education, collaboration on renewable energy with Haiti, and funding for INCLE programs. It also includes directives on development, governance, family-based care for orphans, NGO access to grants, reforestation, correction facilities, human trafficking, and oversight funding for USAID. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 authorizes a $120 million contribution for the multi-donor trust fund, $252 million for debt relief for Haiti, and $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti. The Secretary of State is required to submit progress reports every 90 days. The State Department funds would reimburse accounts for evacuation of Embassy family members and non-essential personnel, repatriation loans for American citizens, and continue staffing support for relief and reconstruction efforts. $5 million is allocated for the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service to repair and support affiliate broadcasting stations, hire staff, and establish a Reporting Center in Port-au-Prince. These broadcasts provide accurate information for Haiti regarding relief, recovery, and family reunification efforts. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes additional funding for State Department operations and broadcasting in diplomatic operations in Haiti, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries. Mexico, Jordan, and El Salvador also receive funding for various aid programs under this legislation. P.L. 111-212 provides funding for various aid programs related to Hurricane Ida, including $15 million for the Democratic Republic of Congo, $45 million for pandemic influenza, and $165 million for refugee assistance. Additionally, Vietnam is recommended to receive $12 million for dioxin contamination remediation. The Administration requested $600 million for border security and additional funding for Capitol Police, but did not request funds for preventing teacher layoffs or providing aid for farmers and energy loans. The House's amended version of the bill H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 enacted on July 29, 2010, did not include funding for preventing teacher layoffs or providing aid for farmers and energy loans. However, funding for these proposals may be included in other bills, such as the Federal Aviation Administration Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act. The House's amended version of bill H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs, despite calls from President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan for federal assistance. The bill was offset over ten years according to CBO. The final version of the bill did not include funds for teacher layoffs as it was not part of the Senate version passed by the House. The House initially included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund in the bill, but later withdrew support and adopted the Senate version. The proposed offsets for the Education Jobs Fund included cuts to Race to the Top grants, Teacher Incentive Fund, and Charter School Program. The proposed offsets for the Education Jobs Fund included cuts to Race to the Top grants, Teacher Incentive Fund, and Charter School Program, triggering a veto threat from the Administration. The American Association of School Administrators estimated that without additional funding, 275,000 teachers and school staff could be laid off in the 2010-2011 school year, leading to increased pupil-to-teacher ratios. The Education Jobs Fund aimed to distribute funds to state governors based on a population-based formula used in the ARRA. The HAC majority draft bill would distribute funds to states within 45 days of enactment for schools to open in the fall. Additional MOE requirements would apply specifically to Texas. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the COPS Office. The proposed funding for law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls was dropped from the House-amended version approved on July 1. The proposed $1.179 billion for hiring funds may not be sufficient to meet the demand, as seen with over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion in response to previous funding. There was no funding included for firefighter hiring and retention in the enacted version of H.R. 4899. Funding for the SAFER program was $210 million in FY2009, $420 million in FY2010, and $305 million requested in FY2011, with proponents advocating for an additional $500 million due to state and local budget shortfalls. Opponents of the additional $500 million for SAFER argue that current funding levels are sufficient, citing the need to reduce federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. Regular appropriations for rural housing have been depleted due to high demand for government loans since 2008. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. This funding aims to prevent otherwise qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers from going unfunded for the rest of FY2010. Additionally, the enacted version raises fees for receiving loan guarantees and adds $697 million of loan guarantee authority for Section 502 rural housing loans. The Agriculture Department is also requesting $75 million for direct loans under Section 502 for FY2011, along with a new fee structure to allow $12 billion of loan guarantees at no cost to the government. The Agriculture Department is requesting $151 million for FY2011 to support $4.7 billion of farm loans. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and $979 million from Agriculture Department accounts. The Administration's FY2011 request for funds for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program is pending. The DOE's FY2011 Loan Guarantee Program request for $500 million for credit subsidy costs may be reduced by $180 million, with $90 million allocated for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy projects. The $180 million appropriation could support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. Additionally, DOE requested $36.0 billion in loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects and $500 million in credit subsidy costs for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Established in 2005, the program aims to support innovative energy technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In FY2009, funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act supported projects and created jobs, with $6 billion allocated for commercial renewable energy projects. $2 billion was later re-programmed for the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, which may be provided in the FY2011 appropriation. The House Appropriations Committee allocated an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, but provided a $4,860 discretionary maximum award level in AY2011-12. The program is funded through annual discretionary appropriations and mandatory appropriations. The Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security along the Southwest Border, partially offset by rescinding $100 million in DHS funds for SBInet. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $399 million for the Department of Homeland Security and $201 million for the Department of Justice for emergency requirements. The DHS funding includes hiring new Border Patrol agents, unmanned aerial detection systems, ICE agents, CBP officers, and CBP canine teams. The DOJ funding aims to increase Federal law enforcement presence in Southwest border districts with ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding also supports Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic and DNA analysis. The FY2010 Supplemental funding did not include any funding for border security, but H.R. 5875 passed with $701 million for this purpose. Both the Administration and H.R. 5875 allocated $201 million to DOJ for border security efforts, mainly for more law enforcement personnel. Additionally, the Administration requested $118 million for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with a proposal to increase funding for the U.S. Coast Guard from the Oil Spill Liability Trust fund. The Oil Spill Liability Trust fund provided advances to the Coast Guard for response activities in P.L. 111-191. The Administration requested funds for various programs related to the oil spill, including employment assistance, inspections, enforcement, and economic impact mitigation. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves a total of $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for enforcement actions, research, economic assistance, long-term impact studies, and seafood inspection technologies. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including expanded stock assessment of fisheries in the Gulf, a study of long-term ecosystem effects, and funding for employment assistance and a National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Additionally, discretionary funds may be used for dredging by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Administration also requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending for various purposes. The Administration proposed additional funding for veterans' benefits and response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, categorizing it as emergency funding to bypass budget constraints. Court settlements would require new legislative authority and funds, leading to new spending for budget enforcement purposes. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. The estimated cost for new presumptions of service connection is $13.4 billion in FY2010, benefiting approximately 86,000 veterans. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. Eligible veterans may receive an increase in disability rating or begin disability compensation based on the new presumptions, with payments starting when final regulations are published. The estimated cost for these new presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010, as requested by the Administration. The differences in cost estimates between CBO and OMB are due to uncertainties in regulation release and processing times for compensation claims. The Administration requested $4.6 billion for veterans benefits related to Agent Orange, approved by both the Senate and House. Section 902 prohibits VA from paying claims until Congressional review period expires. $1.15 billion for Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case and $3.4 billion for Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement requested. Deadlines for settlements have been extended multiple times. The Pigford II discrimination case settlement was announced on February 18, 2010, but the $1.15 billion appropriation requested was not made by Congress. The settlement is final and non-appealable, with a provision stating that claimants could void the settlement if funds were not appropriated by March 31, 2010. Despite the deadline passing without funds being allocated, it is unlikely that claimants will void the settlement in the near term. The Cobell v. Salazar case settlement involves $3.4 billion to resolve mismanagement of Indian trust fund accounts. $1.4 billion will go to plaintiffs, $2 billion for land interests consolidation and education scholarships. The settlement requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with possible further extensions. The lawsuit stemmed from Interior's inability to accurately account for Individual Indian Monies trust accounts due to age and splitting of interests. The Cobell settlement involves $3.4 billion to resolve mismanagement of Indian trust fund accounts, creating 384,000 IIM accounts worth over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may support the settlement to end costly litigation. Congressional approval is divided, with the enacted H.R. 4899 not including the requested $4.6 billion appropriation. The House version included direct spending authority from the Judgment Fund, but rules require offsets for such spending. Funding for Cobell and Pigford II court settlements was dropped from the final version of H.R. 4213 (P.L. 111-205). Senator Reid may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill or attaching them to other bills. If included in another bill, offsets in mandatory programs would be required under PAYGO provisions. H.R. 4899 did not include $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years from provisions to reduce government medical care expenditures. These provisions involve increasing rebates states receive from drug manufacturers and giving the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The House version of the supplemental appropriations act aimed to amend Medicaid law by including different forms of outpatient drugs in the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) calculation to increase Medicaid drug rebates. This change was not included in earlier versions of the bill or the Administration request. The House proposed amending Medicaid drug rebates by including various forms of drugs in the AMP calculation, aiming to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The Senate did not accept these provisions, but a similar amendment was included in a substitute bill. Additionally, the House version of the bill included sections to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. Since the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, the FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent expires, allowing for lower prices. Pay-to-delay agreements between brand-name and generic manufacturers delay generic drug availability, increasing costs for consumers and the government. The provisions in the FTC Act would make agreements involving compensation for delaying generic drug development unlawful, with FTC rulemaking authority and provisions for judicial review and civil penalties. CBO estimated that implementing these provisions would reduce federal spending by $2.42 billion and increase revenues by $0.26 billion over the 2010-2020 period. The Senate did not accept these provisions, and the enacted version did not include funds for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. The House July amended version allocated $538 million in WFA funding to various federal agencies for activities to reduce improper payments and prevent illegal activity. This included $245 million for enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS and $250 million for the HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account, with funds also going to the HHS Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Justice. The House allocated $60 million to the Department of Justice for HHS fraud investigations, $38 million for SSA disability reviews, and $5 million for DOL reemployment reviews. The funds were not emergency designated and would be available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated a $538 million increase in the federal deficit in 2010 with no estimated savings. The Administration proposed using the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance response activities and establish an unemployment assistance program for those not eligible for other benefits. This fund allows for up to $150 million annually for response efforts, funded by an excise tax on petroleum. The proposal includes a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax to support the trust fund and a new unemployment benefit program. The responsible parties for oil spills would reimburse the U.S. Treasury for program costs. Mandatory appropriations from the trust fund were authorized, with later withdrawals not needing additional appropriations. The Administration's proposal aims to use the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities, with a $125 million estimate in mandatory appropriations offset by recoveries from responsible parties. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances of $100 million each from the fund for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with a proposed increase in the expenditure cap to $1.5 billion. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available for obligation by the end of FY2010. The proposed increase in the limitation on annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would apply exclusively to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to enhance federal emergency response capabilities. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress of any advanced funds for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill within 7 days, while other spills would still require 30 days notice. Legislation raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill and allows $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications. The legislation enacted on June 15th, 2010, raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill, allowing $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010 offset by reimbursements in FY2012. H.R. 4899 did not include the proposed unemployment compensation program. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. On March 24, 2010, H.R. 4899 was passed with $5.7 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate later passed a version with $59.3 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti reconstruction. The House adopted the Senate version on May 25, 2010, adding funds for education and court cases, totaling $81.8 billion in spending. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version on July 22. The House passed H.R. 4899 on March 24, 2010, with $5.7 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate version on May 25, 2010, included $5.1 billion for FEMA, $36.6 billion for war-related activities, and $2.9 billion for Haiti relief. The House adopted the Senate version on July 27, 2010, with a total spending of $81.8 billion. President signed the bill on July 29, 2010. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included $2.9 billion for Haiti relief, $200 million for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, $13.4 billion for benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, and additional funding for disaster relief programs. The total spending was $59.3 billion, offset by $300 million in rescissions, resulting in a total of $58.9 billion. The Senate version was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request. The Senate agreed to consider and vote on six amendments within strict time limits, including proposals for additional funding for National Guard personnel and measures to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Senators also proposed amendments related to border security and oil spill costs. Senators McCain and Coburn proposed amendments to cut federal funding by $59 billion to offset additional spending on oil spill response. Senator Inouye questioned the feasibility of these proposals. Six individual votes on various amendments were rejected, including funding for National Guard personnel and border security measures. After rejecting multiple proposed amendments, the Senate invoked cloture on May 27, 2010, by a vote of 69 to 20. Subsequently, 16 amendments were adopted in a Managers' amendment. Amendments included funding for National Guard deployment, setting a timetable for troop redeployment from Afghanistan, and cutting federal spending by $59 billion over 10 years. On July 1, 2010, the House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 with additional funding for domestic programs and rescissions. The House also adopted a rule governing floor consideration and enrolled the bill to be sent to the Senate. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2010, with additional funding for domestic programs and rescissions. The rule authorized funding for court cases, a summer jobs program, and changed transportation grant formulas. Republican members argued for confining spending to specific areas, while Democratic members justified additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs during the recession. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2010, with additional funding for domestic programs. The additional spending included funds for education job preservation, Pell Grants, border security, Medicare and Medicaid integrity initiatives, nuclear and alternative energy loans, oil spill recovery, agricultural and farm loans, and mine safety efforts. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2010, included additional funding for various domestic programs, such as education job preservation, Pell Grants, border security, Medicare and Medicaid integrity initiatives, nuclear and alternative energy loans, oil spill recovery, agricultural and farm loans, and mine safety efforts. The House version also allocated $2.5 billion for non-defense DOD spending, $300 million for base closure related transportation improvements, and $16.5 million for a Soldier Readiness Center at Fort Hood. Additionally, the House version had larger offsets from rescissions and savings in mandatory programs compared to the Senate version. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with funds expiring if unobligated at the end of their useful life. The rescissions covered various areas such as DOD funding, highway contract authority, pandemic flu funds, American Recovery Act funding, Education Department funding, disaster assistance funding, State Department funding, and other programs. The Office of Management and Budget stated that the President would veto any version of the bill. In 2010, the Office of Management and Budget warned that the President would veto any bill undermining his authority as Commander-in-Chief in Afghanistan or including $800 million in rescissions to the Administration's education initiative. The House rejected three amendments related to war funding in Afghanistan on July 1, 2010. The House rejected an amendment in 2011 that required the President to submit a withdrawal plan for Afghanistan, conduct a new intelligence estimate, and report on oversight of contractors. The amendment failed by a vote of 162 to 260. Earlier proposals to add funding for the COPS program and Firefighter Assistance grants were removed before floor action."
