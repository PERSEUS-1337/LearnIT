    "content": "Congress has been grappling with the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The IHCIA authorizes various specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, Congress continues to appropriate funds for these programs. Negotiations for reauthorization have led to multiple bills in the 106th-109th Congresses. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) has been the focus of reauthorization bills in the 106th-109th Congresses. Various bills were introduced and reported by different committees, addressing Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP. Congress also faces financial claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes related to Indian trust funds and lands mismanagement. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) within DOI have undergone controversial reorganization due to issues with managing trust funds and lands for Indian tribes and individuals. Trust lands total about 56 million acres, with funds totaling $3.3 billion in tribal and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The BIA has been criticized for its management of trust lands and funds, leading to the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 to address these issues. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 directed the Secretary of the Interior to oversee trust fund balances and created the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) to manage trust reforms. This led to a class action lawsuit by IIM account holders demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of mismanagement. The lawsuit found that the Department of the Interior and Treasury breached their trust duties and ordered them to bring trust management up to current standards. The lawsuit involving IIM plaintiffs aims to determine the amount of money in their accounts. The district court decided on the accounting method, with DOI proposing a limited reconciliation while plaintiffs suggested a more comprehensive approach. DOI's method estimated losses in the tens of millions, while plaintiffs' methods showed losses of over $100 billion. The court ordered a historical accounting without statistical sampling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the order. DOI estimated compliance costs at $12-13 billion. The district court has not issued another order on historical accounting. DOI continues its efforts. Congress has not issued any new orders on historical accounting for the Cobell lawsuit. The DOI is still carrying out its historical accounting plan. Concerns have been raised about the costs of the lawsuit potentially impacting DOI trust reform implementation and other Indian programs. Current costs include ongoing litigation expenses, with potential future costs estimated at $12-$13 billion for court-ordered historical accounting and a possible Cobell settlement. Congress has not introduced any bills to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. The Cobell plaintiffs have proposed a settlement amount of over $100 billion for their IIM accounts. Funding sources include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" Congress may consider various options for settlement, including introducing bills like S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 in the 109th Congress. These bills aim to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund and create a commission to review Indian trust asset management. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on bills S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 in 2005 and 2006, proposing changes to Indian trust management. A settlement amount of $8 billion was discussed, but negotiations were ongoing regarding including IIM land mismanagement claims. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made organizational changes since the 1994 Act, including transferring the management of trust funds from BIA to OST in 1996. In 1996, the management of trust funds was transferred from BIA to OST, while trust lands and physical assets remained with BIA. A reorganization in 2003 split BIA trust management operations from other services, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs opposed the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear OST duties. Efforts to stop the reorganization in Congress have failed, with proposals for changes in DOI and BIA trust management. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA; P.L. 100-497) was enacted to regulate gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, with tribes using gaming revenues for economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for certain tribes and circumstances. Critics argue that these exceptions lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine the intent of the law. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to curb exceptions in land acquisition for tribes, removing the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement. They allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed, with added limitations such as a \"nexus\" to the tribe's lands. The bills retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes, but with additional requirements. Critics argue that the bills impose new burdens on tribes. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to address exceptions in land acquisition for tribes, removing the need for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement. Critics argue that the bills impose new burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes, including unprecedented requirements for mitigation agreements. H.R. 4893 failed to pass in the House, while S. 2078 is awaiting Senate floor action. Native Hawaiians, not currently considered Indians under federal law, lack a recognized political entity, leading to concerns about the legality of federal and state programs benefiting them. Native Hawaiians are excluded from the DOI process for recognition, requiring congressional action for a political entity. Bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish this process, leaving questions about governmental powers and lands for later negotiations. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous peoples. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians, like Indian tribes, have maintained a distinct community with cultural and political institutions, and Congress has the constitutional authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity. Opponents dispute this, stating that Congress's authority only extends to Indian tribes, not all indigenous peoples. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it would be unconstitutional and not justified by a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians like with Indian tribes. They also claim that it would be based on race alone, setting a precedent for other race-based groups. Some opponents dispute claims of Native Hawaiian sovereignty, stating it ended before 1893. Bills similar to S. 147 and H.R. 309, related to the 1893 overthrow, were considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005 but failed to proceed in 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and a hearing was held on constitutional issues related to it in 2005."
