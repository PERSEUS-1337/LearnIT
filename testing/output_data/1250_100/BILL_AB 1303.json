The Government Code in California prohibits cities and counties from imposing new conditions on building permits for residential units within five years of final map approval, except under specific circumstances such as ensuring compliance with zoning ordinances and state or federal laws. This also applies to cities incorporating areas from tentative or parcel maps after January 1, 1985. The Government Code in California prohibits cities and counties from imposing new conditions on building permits for residential units within five years of final map approval, except under specific circumstances. This also applies to cities incorporating areas from tentative or parcel maps. Additionally, for extended tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps, the five-year period is reduced to three years. The code does not prohibit levying fees or imposing conditions related to building permits. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code in California extends the expiration date of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps within specific counties by 24 months if approved between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. The legislative body or advisory agency can extend the expiration date of approved tentative maps in specific counties by 24 months if the map is consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. If not consistent, the extension may be denied or conditionally approved for 24 months. Additionally, an automatic 60-day extension is granted upon application for an extension before the map expires. The expiration date of approved tentative maps can be extended for 60 days or until the extension application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If denied, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, conditions must be met: household income < 80% of statewide income, unemployment rate at least 2.75% higher than statewide rate, poverty rate at least 4% higher than statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects is provided in addition to any existing extensions. Legislative, administrative, or other approvals by state agencies related to a development project will be extended by 24 months. Modifications to conditions for building permits or subdivision maps are outlined in the provisions of Section 65961. This act allows local agencies to levy charges to fund mandated services. It is an urgency statute to preserve development applications set to expire due to economic conditions."
