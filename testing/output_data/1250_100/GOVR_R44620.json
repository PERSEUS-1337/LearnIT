    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms, such as human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. Biologics are composed of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. In contrast, chemical drugs are synthesized and have a simpler molecular structure. The biologic drug Remicade contains thousands of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was FDA approved in April 2016. The FDA regulates biologics and chemical drugs through different centers. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) oversees traditional biologics like vaccines and gene therapy products. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including therapeutic biologics like monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and immunomodulators are types of biologics used in cancer treatment and other diseases. These substances require special handling to avoid contamination. Biologics, also known as specialty drugs, require special handling to avoid contamination and are often administered via injection or infusion. They are expensive, with some medications costing over $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase over the previous year. In 2016, $105.5 billion was spent on biologics in the US, with a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics spending has been rising by 10% annually since 2011. The introduction of biosimilars in Europe has led to price reductions for biologics, with some drugs seeing a 33% to 61% decrease in prices. Congress has made efforts to lower drug prices, including the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 and similar approaches for biologics in 2010. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allows FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug costs by 60% to 90%. Generic drugs must be identical to the original product and meet manufacturing standards before approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allows FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug costs by 60% to 90%. The biotechnology industry developed its first biologics for human therapeutic use during this time, with products like human insulin, growth hormone, interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. Biological products are regulated by FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), while chemical prescription drugs are regulated through a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs under the FFDCA, but did not provide a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for FDA review. Insulin, a small protein regulating carbohydrate metabolism, was regulated as a drug by FDA despite its similarity to other biologics. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for specialty biologic drug products even as patent protection was expiring. Market competition with generics could not occur for therapeutic biologics. The European Medicines Agency authorized marketing of biosimilars with seemingly fewer barriers in April 2006. In April 2006, the European Medicines Agency authorized the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, a human growth hormone. FDA approval of Omnitrope in the United States followed a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used for approval. The FDA indicated that this approval did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. The FDA approval of Omnitrope did not establish a pathway for approval of other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress created an abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilar products in 2010, allowing FDA to approve products that are highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed biological product. This authority was granted through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. The FDA created an abbreviated pathway for biosimilar products in 2010, allowing for approval of products highly similar to licensed biological products. To be considered interchangeable, a biosimilar must demonstrate the same clinical results as the reference product in any patient. FDA held public meetings to gather industry and public input before releasing guidance on the biosimilars pathway. The FDA released final guidance on biosimilars in April 2015, requiring companies to submit applications demonstrating biosimilarity based on analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Any changes to the manufacturing process must be approved by the FDA to ensure product quality and safety. The FDA requires companies to demonstrate biosimilarity for biosimilars through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Manufacturing changes must be approved to maintain product quality and safety. Brand-name biologics and biosimilars' variability can be effectively managed. Sales of some biosimilars have been delayed due to brand-name manufacturers' actions, including patent infringement lawsuits and anticompetitive tactics. The FDA approved seven biosimilars between March 2015 and October 2017, including Zarxio, the first biosimilar product in the US. Remicade and other brand-name biologics like Enbrel and Humira are top-selling drugs. Insurers faced anticompetitive tactics preventing coverage of biosimilars like Inflectra and Renflexis. In the United States, Zarxio is a biosimilar to Neupogen, both approved for the same indications. FDA approved Inflectra as a biosimilar to Remicade in April 2016. Pfizer began marketing Inflectra in late November 2016 at a price 15% below Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017 alleging anticompetitive practices. In September 2017, Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to exclusionary contracts with health insurers, blocking coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. The rebate offered by J&J for Remicade incentivizes insurers to prefer the higher-priced brand-name drug over biosimilars. This creates a \"rebate trap\" where the branded manufacturer can withdraw rebates to maintain their preferred position. The \"rebate trap\" occurs when a payer's cost for a patient using a branded biologic doubles once the rebate is withdrawn. Even with a 60% cheaper biosimilar available, if only 50% of patients switch, payer costs increase. To avoid this trap, a near-complete switch to biosimilars is needed, but many chronic disease patients are unlikely to switch. Pfizer's lawsuit claims providers are not purchasing Inflectra, even for insured patients. The lawsuit alleges that health care providers and insurers have largely avoided purchasing Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, despite its availability. J&J, the manufacturer of Remicade, has been accused of raising prices and engaging in anticompetitive practices to maintain dominance in the market. Pfizer, the maker of Inflectra, claims that J&J's actions hinder competition and limit patient access to more affordable treatment options. In August 2016, FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi (etanercept-szzs), manufactured by Sandoz, which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Enbrel (etanercept) by Amgen. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs globally and in the US. Erelzi is approved for all indications on the Enbrel label, with clinical data confirming its similarity to the reference product. A lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and its parent company Novartis has delayed the marketing release of Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel. In contrast, Amjevita, another biosimilar to Humira, has been approved for 7 indications compared to Humira's 10 indications. Amjevita is involved in patent infringement litigation between Amgen and AbbVie. Amjevita is involved in patent infringement litigation between Amgen and AbbVie, delaying its commercial availability until at least 2018. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, made by Samsung Bioepsis. Renflexis is sold at a 35% lower price than Remicade in partnership with Merck. Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, was approved by FDA in August 2017, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Humira (adalimumab) is a top-selling drug manufactured by AbbVie. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement, delaying the launch of Cyltezo. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, in September 2017. Avastin is another top-selling drug made by Genentech. The proprietary name of a drug is its trademarked name used for marketing. The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by FDA under the PHS Act, including biosimilars and interchangeable products, with their nonproprietary names. FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2015, finalized in 2017, using proper names for originator, related, and biosimilar products. The FDA uses proper names for biological products, including originator, related, and biosimilar products. The names consist of a core name and a distinguishing suffix of four lowercase letters. The core name is adopted by the USAN Council for reference products, while biosimilars use the INN system. The WHO released the Biological Qualifier proposal in 2016 for unique naming of biosimilars. \"The BQ is a code formed of four random consonants in two 2-letter blocks separated by a 2-digit checksum. Biosimilar industry groups support shared use of a nonproprietary name, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between reference biologic product and biosimilar. FTC expressed concern that FDA's naming proposal could deter physicians from prescribing biosimilars, impeding market development and competition.\" The FDA's proposal for biosimilar naming involves using the same nonproprietary name as the reference biologic, with unique suffixes to differentiate between products. However, differences in nonproprietary names may lead to misconceptions about the similarity between biosimilars and their reference biologics. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is misleading and that variability is inherent in biologics. The FDA's final rule on prescription drug labeling, including biological products, provides information approved by the FDA for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. The labeling conveys details from the new drug application or biologics license application submitted by the applicant. FDA requires labeling to start with a highlights section containing warnings. Other required elements include indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. FDA's draft guidance on biosimilar labeling suggests including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The biosimilar product may not have the same labeling as the reference product. Comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity should not be included in the labeling to avoid confusion. The FDA requires biosimilar labeling to include a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section, but comparative data are not included to prevent confusion. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association believes the statement is unnecessary and confusing, while BIO advocates for more information in labeling to aid prescribers. The transition of biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA will occur in March 2020 under the BPCIA provision. The BPCIA provision under the PHSA will transition certain biological products to be licensed under the PHSA by March 2020. FDA released draft guidance on this provision in March 2016, outlining the requirements for submitting marketing applications for biological products. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision under the PHSA states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after March 23, 2020. Any pending applications should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA. Industry representatives have raised concerns about potential delays in the approval of competing biological products. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision states that any unexpired exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product would cease to have effect after March 23, 2020. Orphan drug exclusivity would still apply, but transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. Industry groups have raised concerns about legal and trade issues with the FDA's policy on exclusivity. The FD&C Act grants a period of exclusivity until 2032 for products deemed to have a license under the PHS Act, hindering competition for biosimilar or interchangeable products. Interchangeable products can produce the same clinical result as the reference product and may be substituted by a pharmacist without the intervention of a health care provider. Biosimilars are not structurally identical to brand-name drugs like generics are. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not approved an interchangeable product yet. In Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make determinations on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policies on interchangeability, with some allowing interchangeability unless proven otherwise. In the United States, FDA regulates the drug product while states regulate pharmacies and pharmacy practices. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), 37 states have considered legislation for biosimilar substitution standards. 27 states and Puerto Rico have enacted legislation with varying provisions. The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This agreement set performance goals and designated fees for new product application reviews, allowing FDA to increase staff and reduce review times. The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) to reduce review times. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews. The BPD program assists industry sponsors in developing biosimilar products. The FDA collects user fees for biosimilar product development programs, with fees waived for small businesses for the first application. The Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized as BsUFA II in 2016, with public meetings and negotiation sessions held to finalize the agreement. The Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) was reauthorized via the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, signed into law by President Trump. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals due to staff shortages, but new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act aim to strengthen capacity. These enhancements are expected to help FDA meet performance goals, encourage price competition, and lower healthcare costs under BsUFA II. Under BsUFA II, the supplement fee and establishment fee have been dropped, while the BsUFA Program fee has been retained with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. The application fee will no longer be reduced by cumulative BPD fees paid. FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 for BsUFA program costs, with a possible adjustment of up to $9 million. The federal government focuses more on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more funding towards clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging due to the overlap between basic and applied research. The development of new drugs relies on major advances like recombinant DNA. Concerns over high pharmaceutical costs have prompted a closer look at the federal role in costly therapeutics. Studies show a small percentage of new drugs originate from non-industry sources. Innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs), often stem from publicly funded research. Between 1998 and 2007, 24.1% of drugs that received FDA approval originated from publicly funded work. A study by Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Additionally, 19% of drugs that received priority review from the FDA were a result of publicly funded research. This suggests that drugs from public-sector research institutions tend to have a significant clinical impact. The 2011 Stevens study analyzed the role of Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) in drug discovery. It excluded the contribution of PSRIs in developing platform technologies like recombinant DNA and gene silencing methods, which were crucial for drug development. The 2011 Stevens study analyzed the role of Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) in drug discovery, excluding their contribution to developing platform technologies. Many new drugs would not have been developed without these platforms, impacting the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 marked the federal government's regulation of biologics. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing inspections. It preceded the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which lacked premarket control over new drugs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act later included controls over manufacturing establishments. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application (NDA) before marketing to ensure safety. The Biologics Control Act was revised under the Public Health Service Act in 1944, specifying that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. The PHSA, amended by FDAMA in 1997, requires a single BLA for biological products. It allows for immediate license suspension in case of public health danger. The BPCIA of 2009 created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products. The BPCIA of 2009 established regulatory exclusivity periods for biologics and biosimilar products, along with procedures for resolving patent disputes. Regulatory authority for biologics was transferred to the FDA in 1972, leading to the creation of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in 1988. CBER moved to the FDA headquarters in 2014, as biotechnology products often blur the lines between biologics, drugs, and devices. The FDA struggled with determining the jurisdictional status of biologics, drugs, and devices due to overlapping characteristics. In 1991, an agreement stated that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER, while a small set of biologics regulated as drugs would be under CDER. In 2002, FDA reorganized review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER for regulation as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Section 351 of the PHSA transferred certain biologic products to CDER, including monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines. Traditional biologics like vaccines, allergenic products, and blood products remain at CBER."
