    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Recent concerns have led to proposals to amend FISA and the practices of the FISC, focusing on the selection process for FISA court judges. Article III of the U.S. Constitution grants judicial power to the Supreme Court and inferior courts, with federal judges enjoying life tenure and salary protection. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to ensure federal courts operate independently. The FISC can issue orders for foreign intelligence investigations, including electronic surveillance and physical searches. Judges on the FISC serve seven-year terms and are appointed by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is composed of 11 district court judges selected from at least seven regional circuits, with one serving as the presiding judge. The FISA Court of Review has three judges selected from district or circuit courts, with one as the presiding judge. Criticisms of the selection process have led to proposed bills in Congress to change how FISA judges are chosen, including transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or giving the President or congressional leadership a role in the selection process. The main issue raised by these proposals is who should have the authority to designate FISA judges. The principal issue raised by proposals to change the selection process of FISA judges is the constitutionality of designating judges by a certain branch of government. The report discusses the constitutional method for appointing Article III judges and explores the constitutionality of shifting designation authority away from the Chief Justice to other officials within the judicial, executive, and legislative branches. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment of certain government officials, including Judges of the supreme Court, by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Supreme Court has ruled that all Article III circuit and district judges are principal officers and must adhere to the Appointments Clause. However, if Congress expands the duties of an office, a second appointment may not be necessary if the additional duties are related to the original post. This was exemplified in Weiss v. United States, where military officers could serve on a military court without a second appointment if the duties were germane to their original appointment. The Supreme Court has upheld that all Article III judges must adhere to the Appointments Clause. Congress has historically allowed existing federal judges to serve in separate Article III capacities without re-nomination. The Chief Justice has been given authority to assign federal judges to specialized tribunals, following the model set by the now-defunct Commerce Court. The Supreme Court has upheld the authority of Congress to designate lower federal court judges for specialized courts, such as the FISA courts. In cases like McDowell v. United States and Lamar v. United States, the Court affirmed that the designation process does not violate the Appointments Clause or the separation of powers. The Court rejected the defendant's argument that the FISA judges' designation violated the Appointments Clause, citing precedent supporting the constitutionality of the process. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges designated to serve on specialized courts. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes changes to the selection process for FISA judges, increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13. The Chief Justice would designate district court judges proposed by chief judges of the circuit courts, with at least five associate justices of the Supreme Court required to concur in the designation for the FISA Court of Review. The Chief Justice would have the final authority to designate judges to the FISA courts under the proposed FISA Judge Selection Reform Act. Judicial precedent suggests that Congress has the power to authorize others within the judicial branch to make such designations. This is supported by the decision in McDowell, which emphasized Congress's control over the jurisdiction of judges. This indicates that there is no constitutional restriction on Congress vesting chief judges with the authority to designate FISA judges. The McDowell decision highlighted Congress's control over judge jurisdiction, suggesting no constitutional restriction on granting chief judges authority to designate FISA judges. Proposals like H.R. 2761 aim to shift this authority to the President, aligning with the Appointments Clause. A reviewing court could interpret that life tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary, allowing judges appointed to FISA courts for fixed terms to retain their Article III status. However, vesting the President with sole authority to select federal judges for FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns. The Court in Mistretta v. United States ruled that the President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission without undermining judicial independence. While the President can remove a judge from the commission, he cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges. FISA judges, unlike those in Mistretta, exercise judicial powers on an Article III court, raising separation-of-powers concerns if the President has sole authority to select them. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove judges could compromise their impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership, but this could pose issues under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. Congressional designations may also raise legal concerns under I.N.S. v. Chadha. The Supreme Court ruling in I.N.S. v. Chadha stated that legislative acts altering legal rights outside the Legislative Branch must meet constitutional requirements. Congressional designations to the judiciary without proper approval may violate these principles."
