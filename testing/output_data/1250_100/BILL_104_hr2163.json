    "content": "The Commercial Revitalization Tax Act of 1995 introduces a new Commercial Revitalization Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a tax credit for commercial revitalization projects. The Commercial Revitalization Tax Act of 1995 introduces a new tax credit for commercial revitalization projects. The credit is based on a percentage of qualified revitalization expenditures for qualified revitalization buildings, with an applicable percentage of either 20 percent or 5 percent per year for a 10-year credit period. Qualified revitalization buildings are defined as buildings located in eligible commercial revitalization areas, allocated with a commercial revitalization credit, and eligible for depreciation. Qualified rehabilitation expenditures include amounts chargeable to capital account for nonresidential real property or improvements. Qualified revitalization expenditures are limited to $10,000,000 per taxable year for a qualified revitalization building, excluding certain expenditures. The definition of 'qualified revitalization expenditure' excludes certain costs, such as those not using straight-line depreciation or exceeding 30% of the total expenditures for building and land acquisition. The term 'eligible commercial revitalization area' includes empowerment zones, enterprise communities, areas designated for federal housing and community development funds, and specially designated commercial revitalization districts in low-income areas. For qualified revitalization buildings, substantial rehabilitation or reconstruction requires expenditures exceeding 25% of the building's fair market value before the work. These qualified revitalization expenditures are accounted for in the year the building is placed in service. The reconstruction of a building is considered a separate building. Rules similar to section 47 apply for progress expenditure payments. The credit for a building in a taxable year cannot exceed the commercial revitalization credit amount allocated by the agency. The allocation is made in the same manner as under section 42(h). The aggregate commercial revitalization credit amount for agencies is determined. The State commercial revitalization credit ceiling is determined based on the population of low-income census tracts and nonmetropolitan areas within the State compared to all States. The national ceiling for 1996 is $100,000,000 and $200,000,000 for 1997. The commercial revitalization credit agency receives $400,000,000 for calendar years after 1997. Low-income areas are defined as areas where at least 50% of residents earn no more than 60% of the median household income. The commercial revitalization credit agency must have a qualified allocation plan approved by the governmental unit to allocate funds for building projects in low-income areas. The qualified allocation plan for a commercial revitalization credit agency includes selection criteria based on local conditions, contribution to strategic plans, increase in employment, and resident involvement. The commercial revitalization credit agency's qualified allocation plan includes selection criteria based on local conditions, strategic plans, employment increase, and resident involvement.
