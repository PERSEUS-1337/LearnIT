    "content": "Many Members of the 116th Congress are interested in Trump Administration efforts to reform USAID, known as Transformation at USAID. The reform process began in 2017 with an executive order and OMB memorandum, focusing on making the government more efficient. USAID submitted its own reform plan to OMB, separate from the State Department's \"redesign\" initiative. OMB's government-wide reform plan, released in June 2018, included several reforms directly related to USAID. The OMB report prescribed 32 government-wide reforms, including restructuring U.S. humanitarian assistance programs and changing USAID's bureau structure. USAID began implementing these reforms under the Transformation initiative, but details on the effort are not fully comprehensive. Various sources like USAID publications and Administrator Mark Green's testimony provide insight into the reform components, making it challenging to determine USAID's prioritization. Most of the Transformation reforms do not require congressional approval. Most reforms proposed under Transformation do not need congressional approval, but some require notification to Congress. Administrator Green has actively involved Congress in shaping and implementing Transformation, emphasizing the importance of congressional support. Congress can influence USAID reforms through oversight and funding requirements. The report analyzes key elements of current USAID reform efforts under Transformation, focusing on objectives, process, structure, and workforce reforms distinct from prior initiatives. Transformation at USAID is an implementation framework for multifaceted reforms that aim to optimize structures and procedures for increased effectiveness. While similar to general government reform efforts, it also signals a distinct vision for USAID's role in foreign affairs, focusing on supporting country transitions towards self-reliant development and enhancing collaboration with the private sector. The Transformation at USAID focuses on self-reliant, locally led development, increasing collaboration with the private sector, supporting U.S. national security strategy, enhancing core capabilities, and using taxpayer dollars efficiently. The core objective is to end the need for foreign assistance by moving partner countries towards economic self-sufficiency. Many proposed reforms align with past efforts to refine foreign assistance deployment for national security goals. The Obama Administration's USAID Forward initiative and the George W. Bush Administration's Development Leadership Initiative aimed to improve USAID's efficiency and effectiveness. Transformation at USAID focuses on self-reliant, locally led development and making changes to programs for a more flexible approach. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" is the organizing principle for policy reforms under Transformation. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" is USAID's approach to countries being able to address their own development challenges without foreign assistance. USAID created a matrix with 17 indicators to measure progress towards self-reliance, based on commitment and capacity. These indicators are maintained by third-party sources and are used to assess all less-developed countries, including those not receiving U.S. foreign assistance. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" is USAID's new approach to country development, focusing on self-sufficiency and capacity building. USAID's five-year country plans prioritize advancing a country's commitment to self-reliance. This approach aims to tailor programming to each country's unique challenges while establishing a common metric for all countries. The indicators selected by USAID for the \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework reflect theories linking economic growth to democratic institutions and markets. These indicators are divided into \"commitment\" and \"capacity\" composites, with more weight given to the \"commitment\" indicators. The inclusion of controversial indicators, such as \"Trade Freedom,\" sparks debate among researchers and practitioners. USAID argues that missions should evaluate the 10 \"capacity\" indicators in their local context, emphasizing that these indicators do not provide a comprehensive diagnosis of development causes. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework focuses on national policy and institutions, shifting away from past initiatives targeting subnational regions. It remains unclear how this approach will impact USAID's relationship with municipal and regional governments. USAID's \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework uses quantitative metrics to inform programmatic allocations, not as scorecards to determine aid eligibility. Poor scores may lead to directing programs through independent NGOs instead of national governments. It remains uncertain if countries' progress will be tracked over time. The framework emphasizes national policy and institutions over subnational regions, impacting USAID's relationships with local governments. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework by USAID focuses on financing self-reliance and private sector engagement to end the need for foreign assistance. It emphasizes countries' ability to generate capital and partner with the private sector for investment. This approach aligns with global development frameworks like the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and aims to leverage Official Development Assistance to mobilize private sector investments in developing countries. The \"Transformation\" initiative focuses on financing self-reliance through domestic resource mobilization and private sector engagement. It aims to create a strong enabling environment for private investment in developing countries, aligning with global development goals like the SDGs. USAID's new Private Sector Engagement Policy plays a central role in repositioning its role in development and supporting partner country self-sufficiency. The USAID released a new Private Sector Engagement Policy (PSE Policy) in April 2019, building on longstanding efforts to leverage resources of nongovernmental actors for international development. The Global Development Alliance (GDA) program, launched in 2001, incubates public-private partnerships. The Obama Administration's U.S. Global Development Lab focuses on innovation and private sector partnerships, with programs like Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) integrating venture capital approaches. The PSE Policy emphasizes business partnerships as part of a broader agenda. The new Private Sector Engagement Policy (PSE Policy) by USAID focuses on business partnerships to attract solutions from scientists and technology innovators. It shifts towards individual enterprises as programmatic targets, aiming to engage a wide range of private sector partners, from multinational corporations to smallholder farmers. This approach broadens USAID's partner makeup and integrates nontraditional partners in program design. The USAID's Private Sector Engagement Policy aims to change its approach to program design by engaging a diverse range of partners, including individual enterprises and nontraditional partners. The agency is implementing reforms to diversify its partner base, support local partner self-reliance, and establish more flexible partnering approaches. These changes are part of a broader Transformation initiative to build partnerships and promote partner self-sufficiency. The USAID is implementing reforms to diversify its partner base and support local partner self-reliance through initiatives like the New Partnerships Initiative and revisions to operational policies. Past experiences, such as the USAID Forward initiative, have influenced the agency's approach to collaboration with partners. The Transformation initiative aims to build on these efforts by promoting collaborative program design and adaptive management. The USAID is undergoing organizational changes to align with the Administration's goals for international development and humanitarian assistance. The agency submitted nine Congressional Notifications detailing proposed structural changes, which are currently on hold for further review by congressional committees. USAID is divided into field missions and headquarters' bureaus and offices, each with specific functions related to geographic, functional, central, and independent offices. The Administrator has indicated that no changes will be made without approval from all four congressional oversight committees. Under Transformation, USAID is reorganizing its chain of command by adding two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators. The Associate Administrator for Relief, Response and Resilience (R3) would oversee the Bureaus for Humanitarian Assistance, Conflict Prevention and Stabilization, and Resilience and Food Security. The Associate Administrator for Strategy and Operations would manage the Bureaus for Legislative and Public Affairs, Policy, Resources and Performance, and Management. This restructuring aims to streamline oversight and improve agency operations. Under Transformation, USAID is reorganizing its chain of command by adding two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators. This three-pronged oversight structure aims to relieve the Administrator of day-to-day responsibilities, allowing focus on agency-wide management priorities. Concerns have been raised about potential politicization with the addition of political appointees. The reorganization primarily focuses on functional and central bureaus, moving from four functional bureaus, six central bureaus/offices, and six independent offices to five functional bureaus, three central bureaus, and four independent offices. The most publicized proposal is the creation of a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. The proposal involves creating a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA) by combining the Offices of Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) into one bureau with eight offices. The main reasons for this merger are to elevate U.S. humanitarian assistance globally and to eliminate duplication of efforts in funding. USAID is combining the Offices of Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to create a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA). This merger aims to improve the management of international disaster assistance funds by eliminating the distinction between food and nonfood aid. The new structure will allow for quicker and more effective responses to complex humanitarian emergencies. This proposal differs from past structures and is seen as a positive step forward in enhancing USAID's humanitarian functions. Consultations are ongoing within the U.S. government, Congress, and the humanitarian community regarding the HA proposal. The proposed merger of the Offices of Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to create a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA) has sparked mixed reactions. While some view it as a positive reform to elevate USAID's humanitarian functions, others are skeptical about its impact on interagency cooperation, global humanitarian funding, and U.S. leadership. Concerns have been raised about the potential decline in U.S. agricultural commodity provision for emergency food assistance and the de-emphasis of nonemergency programs under the new bureau context. Additionally, the creation of the Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) is a significant structural change proposed. The proposed merger of the Offices of Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to create a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA) has sparked mixed reactions. The creation of the Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) is a significant structural change proposed, aiming to consolidate agency functions for better coordination and support for field missions. The Global Development Lab's absorption into a larger bureau, as part of USAID's Transformation, raises concerns about potential demotion of innovation in development. Transformation aims to modify workforce management structures and processes to enhance adaptability in complex situations. Changes include new hiring mechanisms, leadership philosophy, and knowledge management framework, all developed by employee-led working groups. USAID staff are hired under various mechanisms, including direct-hire and non-direct hire positions. The Transformation workforce reforms at USAID include new hiring mechanisms to address staffing concerns raised after the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola response. Direct-hire positions come with full U.S. government benefits, while non-direct hire positions, such as USPSCs and ISCs, have varying benefits funded by program funds. The agency deployed 94% of its crisis roster during the Ebola outbreak, leading to the development of a new hiring mechanism for crisis response. The working group at USAID started developing a new hiring mechanism for crisis response in late 2016, which evolved into the Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) by 2018. The APP is a noncareer, excepted service mechanism aimed at providing more flexibility in workforce management. Key features include flexible tenure with time-limited positions determined by hiring managers. The Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) at USAID offers flexible tenure for positions, allowing for short-term projects or long-term roles. Nonexcepted federal positions are classified, but APP employees can move across different functional areas easily. APP employees receive government benefits and are part of a streamlined performance management system. 300 positions will be established for crisis response offices. USAID's Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) aims to create 300 positions for crisis response offices, with plans to expand to 1,200 positions in the following years. Congressional approval is needed to use program funds for the pilot, and internal policies will be developed if approvals are received. Congress may have ongoing areas of interest related to USAID operations and budget. The USAID reform activities may raise cross-cutting issues, such as the role of foreign assistance in U.S. foreign policy. Congress may need to consider if the goal of ending the need for foreign assistance aligns with national security interests. Alternative forms of engagement, like cultural exchange programs and investment agreements, could help maintain U.S. influence if foreign assistance is no longer needed. The Fulbright program and increased business ties may help maintain strong relationships and U.S. influence in countries transitioning away from U.S. aid. USAID is undergoing Transformation, with proposed budget cuts that could impact program allocation. The addition of new political appointee positions at USAID raises concerns about politicization of development decisions. The Transformation at USAID focuses on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, potentially phasing out existing ones. Administrator Green emphasizes self-reliance roadmaps as a guide for congressional allocation decisions. Congress may inquire about strategies, structures, and processes to be integrated or phased out due to Transformation. The Transformation at USAID focuses on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, potentially phasing out existing ones. Administrator Green emphasizes self-reliance roadmaps as a guide for congressional allocation decisions. Congress may consult with USAID to ensure indicator configuration aligns with priorities, including global health, basic education, agricultural development, democracy promotion, and women's empowerment. Other priorities of Transformation, such as operational flexibility in nonpermissive environments and countering violent extremism, have received less attention recently. The Transformation at USAID focuses on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, potentially phasing out existing ones. Congress may consider seeking additional information on how Transformation would align with the Administration's planned Prosper Africa trade and investment initiative. It is unclear how indicators used by the State Department and Millennium Challenge Corporation will be used in conjunction with USAID's new self-reliance indicators. Congress may also consider whether certain reforms should be broadened to include State Department policies. The proposed merger of the Offices of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace into the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance raises questions about the future of Food for Peace Act Title II programming. The Office of Food for Peace is currently dual-funded, but in the proposed HA Bureau, it would cease to exist in name. Congress may seek to understand how the HA Bureau would meet its mandates outlined in the farm bill."
