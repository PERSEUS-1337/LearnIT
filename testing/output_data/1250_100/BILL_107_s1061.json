    "content": "The Act titled \"Fern Lake Conservation and Recreation Act of 2001\" is established for the purpose of conserving and promoting recreational activities in the Fern Lake area. The Congress finds that Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed in Bell County, Kentucky, and Claiborne County, Tennessee, are potential additions to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. Acquiring Fern Lake and its watershed would protect the vista from Pinnacle Overlook, enhance recreational opportunities, and safeguard the water supply for the City of Middlesboro. The 4,500-acre watershed is privately owned, with the lake and part of the watershed currently for sale. The Secretary of the Interior is unable to use appropriated funds to acquire the lands due to restrictions in the Act of June 11, 1940. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use appropriated funds to acquire Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed from willing sellers. The purposes are to protect scenic and natural resources, enhance recreational opportunities at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, and ensure a safe water supply for the City of Middlesboro, Kentucky. The Act authorizes the acquisition of Fern Lake and its watershed to protect scenic and natural resources, enhance recreational opportunities at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, and ensure a safe water supply for the City of Middlesboro, Kentucky. The Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, is authorized to acquire approximately 4,500 acres of land, including Fern Lake and its surrounding watershed, for addition to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. The acquisition aims to protect scenic and natural resources, enhance recreational opportunities, and ensure a safe water supply for the City of Middlesboro, Kentucky. The Secretary may acquire lands by donation, purchase, or exchange with owner consent. Easements for water supply may be acquired. Upon acquisition, park boundaries will be revised. Fern Lake management for water quality protection is required. The Secretary may enter into contracts for the sale of water from Fern Lake for the municipal water supply of Middlesboro, Kentucky. Proceeds from the sale will be available for park expenditure without further appropriation. Consultation requirements are in place to manage Fern Lake for water provision and recreational opportunities. When adding Fern Lake to the park, the Secretary must consult with officials from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, tourism organizations, and other interested parties."
