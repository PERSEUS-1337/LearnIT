    "content": "The Act titled \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This provision includes a transitional increase amount based on a specific formula determined by the year of eligibility for old-age insurance benefits. The primary insurance amount for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits is determined based on a specific formula. The transitional increase amount varies depending on the year of eligibility, with percentages ranging from 60% in 1979 to 10% in 1983. Excess under former law is defined as the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the amount calculated under current law. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is determined based on specific criteria, excluding certain provisions and applying rules from December 1978. The calculation includes calendar years after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) up to the year the individual turns 61, plus three additional years. The text discusses the calculation of the primary insurance amount for individuals based on specific criteria and rules from December 1978. It includes calendar years after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) up to the year the individual turns 61, plus three additional years. The paragraph in question clarifies the application of certain provisions to ensure a greater primary insurance amount for the individual. The text discusses the effective date and related rules for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals based on specific criteria and rules from December 1978. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if included in the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under specific criteria from December 1987. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recalculate the primary insurance amount to reflect the changes made by this Act, disregarding section 215(f)(1) of the Social Security Act."
