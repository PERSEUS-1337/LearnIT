    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impacts of products. Courts have limited consumer actions under the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, resulting in few enforcement actions in the past 80 years to prevent forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Perpetrators of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains face challenges due to limited scope, broad expectations, and lack of information. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts if trafficking or forced labor is involved. United States courts also have jurisdiction over Federal employees or contractors engaging in these crimes abroad. Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees are prohibited from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. They must maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan as required by Executive Orders and Acts. The sense of Congress emphasizes the need for legislation to prevent forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains. Businesses and consumers should have access to information on products free of these abuses to avoid supporting them inadvertently. Public disclosures can help in avoiding tainted raw materials and finished products. The need for legislation to prevent forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains is emphasized. Public disclosures can help avoid tainted goods and finished products.
