Some argue that these schools are unfairly blamed, as they also serve as important educational institutions in impoverished Muslim-majority countries. The term madrasa can refer to both a school and an institution offering Islamic instruction. Madrasas historically provided instruction in Islamic subjects such as the Quran, hadith, fiqh, and law. The term \"madrasa\" is now used broadly to refer to any school promoting an Islamic-based curriculum. In different countries, madrasa can refer to various types of educational institutions. The term madrasa typically refers to Islamic religious schools at the primary and secondary levels, with the institution being centuries old. Madrasas, built in Baghdad during the eleventh century A.D., spread rapidly throughout the Muslim world, offering food, lodging, and a free education with a religious curriculum. In the 1970s, madrasas saw a revival with the rising interest in religious studies and Islamist politics. In the 1980s, they received increased financial support from various countries, serving as recruiting grounds for anti-Soviet fighters. In the early 1990s, the Taliban movement was formed by Afghan Islamic clerics and students advocating a strict form of Islam similar to Wahhabism. Madrasas have become popular due to rising costs and shortages of public educational institutions, leading to debates on improving state schools as an alternative. The U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) 2003 strategy paper highlights concerns about madrasas promoting militant forms of Islam near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Some madrasas focus solely on teaching violence, while others may instruct students to reject Western culture. The paper also mentions links between madrasas and extremist groups as \"rare but worrisome.\" Madrasas are traditional Islamic schools that are criticized for promoting a narrow education focused on religion. Some argue that the outdated teaching methods and curriculum do not prepare students for the modern workforce. However, supporters believe that the traditional approach preserves Islamic heritage. Authorities are considering adding science and math content to the curriculum while maintaining the religious character. Madrasas offer free education and appeal to impoverished families. Funding comes from private donations through zakat, a form of alms-giving in Islam. Madrasas receive funding from zakat for charitable causes and religious education. Concerns have been raised about donations from Persian Gulf countries supporting radical Islam in educational institutions worldwide. There is debate over the impact of Gulf-funded religious curricula on moderate beliefs in the Muslim world. Several Gulf states have strengthened controls on charities funding madrasas, but links between donors and recipients remain unclear. Pakistan's madrasas are a concern due to poverty-driven reliance on them for education. The reform of Pakistan's madrasa system is seen as a counterterrorism tool and a way to stabilize the Afghan government. Concerns about madrasas being used as incubators for extremism have led to calls for increased oversight and registration of these institutions. Pakistani authorities have renewed plans to require all madrasas to register with the government and disclose their sources of funding. The Pakistani government mandated all madrasas to register and disclose their funding sources. Incentives were offered for compliance, with over 12,000 out of 13,000 madrasas registering by January 2007. Foreign students were required to leave by December 31, 2005, with some facing deportation if they did not obtain permission to stay. Some groups resisted government efforts, but authorities stated they would not use force or shut down noncompliant institutions. The Pakistani government mandated madrasas to register and disclose funding sources. An air-strike on a madrasa in Bajaur killed 80 militants, sparking protests. Security forces raided a girls madrasa related to the Red Mosque, resulting in over 100 deaths. The U.S. Department of State reported that many Pakistani madrasas teach extremist doctrine. Madrasas' popularity is increasing in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia having a large Muslim population. In Indonesia, almost 20%-25% of primary and secondary school children attend Islamic religious schools known as pesantrens, which teach a moderate form of Islam including Sufism. Authorities in Bangladesh are concerned about madrasas being used by Islamist activists linked to bombing attacks. The U.S. is focusing on improving outreach and addressing educational challenges in the Muslim world post-9/11. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act addresses concerns from the 9/11 Commission's report by establishing an International Youth Opportunity Fund to improve education in the Middle East. USAID committed $100 million for education reform in Pakistan. The Administration requested funding for education assistance programs in Middle Eastern and South/Central Asian countries. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 re-authorizes appropriations for an International Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 re-authorizes appropriations for an International Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund established to improve education in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries. Annual reports to Congress are required on efforts to increase modern basic education availability and combat religious extremism and terrorism."
