    "content": "The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, initiated in 1986 under GATT, concluded in 1994 with the signing of the WTO Agreement. This agreement requires countries to accept all negotiated trade agreements. It includes long-standing GATT obligations and new agreements, as well as the Dispute Settlement Understanding for resolving disputes between WTO Members. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body administers dispute resolution through consultations, panels, and appeals. Non-compliance with WTO obligations can lead to compensation or retaliatory measures. The URAA implemented the WTO Agreement and Uruguay Round agreements in the US, addressing their legal effect on federal and state law. The URAA implements WTO agreements in the US, addressing their legal effect on federal and state law. It prohibits private remedies for alleged violations of WTO agreements and requires the USTR to keep Congress informed of disputes. The URAA also places requirements on agencies to implement WTO decisions and contains provisions necessary to implement the agreements. The URAA implements WTO agreements in the US, addressing their legal effect on federal and state law. It prohibits private remedies for alleged violations of WTO agreements and requires specific congressional or administrative action to implement WTO decisions challenged in the WTO. The URAA, implemented in 1994, clarifies that U.S. law takes precedence over any conflicts with WTO agreements. It ensures necessary changes to U.S. law are incorporated and any conflicts can be addressed through subsequent legislation. Congress believes changes to federal statutes should be specifically enacted, not preempted by international agreements. Dispute settlement findings that a U.S. statute is inconsistent with an agreement cannot be implemented without specific action. The URAA clarifies that U.S. law takes precedence over conflicts with WTO agreements. Changes to federal statutes must be specifically enacted by Congress, not preempted by international agreements. Dispute settlement findings inconsistent with a U.S. statute require specific legislative action for implementation. State law disputes in WTO proceedings involve federal-state cooperation and centralized response by the federal government. The URAA clarifies that U.S. law prevails over conflicts with WTO agreements. State laws not conforming to Uruguay Round Agreements are not automatically preempted. Private remedies are prohibited, and U.S. legal action is restricted in challenging WTO dispute settlement findings. The URAA prohibits private remedies and restricts U.S. legal action in challenging WTO dispute settlement findings. It aims to occupy the field with respect to any cause of action or defense under the Uruguay Round Agreements. The URAA prohibits private remedies and restricts U.S. legal action in challenging WTO dispute settlement findings. It aims to occupy the field with respect to any cause of action or defense under the Uruguay Round Agreements. The joint Senate committee report on the act states that this provision would prevent private parties from suing a state under any Uruguay Round agreement. The House Ways and Means Committee report emphasizes that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government, not private citizens, to ensure consistency with U.S. obligations under international agreements. Section 102(c) allows government agencies to consider if their actions align with Uruguay Round agreements, but any changes must be authorized by domestic law. The URAA outlines procedures for agencies to follow when implementing adverse WTO decisions, with Section 123 addressing regulatory modifications and Section 129. Section 123 of the URAA requires consultation with Congress, private sector advice, and public comment before amending regulations found inconsistent with WTO agreements. It mandates a 60-day consultation period with Congress and excludes regulations of the U.S. International Trade Commission. Section 129 addresses new determinations in domestic trade remedy proceedings. Section 129 of the URAA outlines procedures for implementing adverse WTO panel and Appellate Body reports in U.S. safeguards, antidumping, and countervailing duty proceedings conducted by the US Trade Representative, US International Trade Commission, and Department of Commerce. The USITC investigates increased imports causing serious injury to domestic industries, with proceedings initiated by industry petitions, government requests, or its own motion. If injury is found, the President may impose temporary import restrictions. Antidumping and countervailing duty investigations can be initiated by petition or the Department of Commerce. The Commerce Department determines if products are sold below fair value or subsidized, while the USITC assesses if imports cause harm to domestic industries. Duties are imposed accordingly. In case of a WTO decision, affected agencies must comply upon USTR request. The USTR may request agencies to comply with WTO decisions. This involves issuing a \"Section 129 Determination\" to align actions with WTO findings. The USTR can direct the DOC to revoke or adjust antidumping/countervailing duty orders based on new determinations. Congress must be consulted during the implementation process. Section 129 determinations have prospective application, applying to unliquidated goods entering the US for consumption on specified dates. They are reviewable in the US Court of International Trade or before binational panels. Determinations not implemented are not subject to judicial review. Private rights of action based on Uruguay Round agreements are precluded under the URAA, but WTO panel findings can be brought to federal courts, mainly in challenges to agency determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. These cases are heard in the U.S. Court of International Trade, with decisions appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal courts must find agency determinations unlawful if unsupported by substantial evidence or not in accordance with the law. In reviewing agency implementation of statutory provisions, courts follow the Chevron two-step analysis. First, they determine if Congress has clearly spoken on the issue. If the statute is silent or ambiguous, the court defers to the agency's reasonable interpretation. The Charming Betsy argument suggests interpreting statutes consistently with U.S. international obligations, such as WTO agreements. This argument applies when a statute is unclear. The Charming Betsy argument applies when a statute is unclear, suggesting interpretation consistent with U.S. international obligations like WTO agreements. Courts have not viewed Section 102(c) of the URAA as preventing them from hearing WTO-based arguments in domestic legal challenges. Federal courts consider WTO decisions as persuasive but not binding, leaving compliance decisions to the executive branch in implementing adverse WTO decisions. In court cases challenging Commerce Department antidumping determinations, the issue of zeroing and its interaction with Chevron and Charming Betsy has been a point of contention. The U.S. practice of zeroing, which has been challenged in WTO dispute settlement proceedings, involves assigning a zero value to sales at or above fair market value. Despite adverse WTO decisions, U.S. courts have upheld the Commerce Department's interpretation of the antidumping statute as allowing zeroing. Compliance with WTO decisions is left to the executive branch, not the courts. The Commerce Department responded to adverse WTO decisions by abandoning the practice of zeroing in original antidumping investigations and proposing modifications for subsequent phases. Legislation introduced in recent Congresses reflected concerns about the broad interpretation of WTO agreements and the executive branch's compliance with decisions, particularly regarding U.S. trade remedies. The U.S. response to WTO decisions on zeroing in antidumping proceedings was discussed in this report."
