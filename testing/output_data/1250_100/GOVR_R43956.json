Administered by the DOJ, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. All RECA benefit applications must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992, with the majority at the Nevada Test Site. The United States conducted 100 atmospheric atomic weapons tests at the Nevada Test Site between 1951 and 1962. The largest test, the Hood Test in 1957, had an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides one-time cash benefits to onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Benefits are not subject to federal income tax and must be applied for before July 10, 2022. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides one-time cash benefits to onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Benefits are not subject to federal income tax and must be applied for before July 10, 2022. Eligible uranium workers receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA). Benefit payments are made to the claimant or their survivors in a specific order of precedence. To be eligible for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements by being present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing in specific geographic areas. Survivors listed in a specific order are eligible for benefits, with no payment if no eligible survivors exist. Affiliated ships were excluded for security and safety purposes during atomic weapons testing. Eligibility for RECA benefits requires being present during testing in specific geographic areas and holding certain occupations. Employees or contract employees of specific government agencies, including those involved in decontamination, cloud tracking, garrison duties on Enewetak atoll, or radiological safety monitoring during atmospheric nuclear detonations, may be eligible for RECA benefits if they develop specified cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. Participants must meet certain exposure criteria to qualify as downwinders. To be eligible for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period between 1951 and 1962 and must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. Uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine for a year or been exposed to a certain level of radiation between 1942 and 1971 in specific states to qualify for benefits. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) defines one working level of radiation exposure as the concentration of radon decay products releasing 130,000 MeV of alpha energy per liter of air. Uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they develop specific respiratory diseases or conditions after exposure to radiation. Millers and transporters must have worked in designated states between 1941 and 1971 for at least one year to be eligible. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits to uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters who develop specific respiratory diseases or conditions after exposure to radiation. Eligible conditions include primary lung cancer, primary renal cancer, chronic renal disease, non-malignant respiratory diseases, and others. Claims for benefits must be submitted in writing with required documentation to the DOJ's Civil Division. Native American applicants have special considerations under the RECA statute. Application decisions are made by an assistant director within the DOJ Civil Division. The DOJ Civil Division's Constitutional and Specialized Torts Section handles RECA benefits applications, with decisions required within 12 months. If no decision is made, the application is automatically approved. The 2000 RECA amendments authorized HHS to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. RESEP clinics in several states offer these services, and applicants are not required to be screened at these clinics. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ. Applicants for RECA benefits can appeal decisions made by the DOJ Civil Division within 60 days in writing. Appeals are reviewed by an appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general. Applicants dissatisfied with the appeal outcome can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations can represent claimants, with limitations on fees for attorneys set by the RECA statute. The RECA program allows attorneys to recover costs and fees for successful claims. Legislation may expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers. Qualifications for RECA benefits as a downwinder include being present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during a specific period. Residents of areas outside of the current downwinder eligibility area had expressed concern about the health effects of fallout from atomic weapons testing. Congress created the RECA program in 1990 due to the inability of downwinders to win civil judgments against the federal government or atomic weapons testing contractors. Legislation to provide compensation to civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS was first introduced in 1979. In 1979, H.R. 4766 and S. 1865 bills were introduced in the 96th Congress to make the United States liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds. Eligibility for compensation under H.R. 4766 was defined for individuals with specific types of cancer in a designated area around NTS. The bill proposed creating a federal advisory board to add specified cancers to the list for compensation. The affected downwinder eligibility area included specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would have the authority to add more affected areas. The original RECA statute covered a smaller area than the proposed bill. The downwinder eligibility area for compensation under the 2000 RECA amendments included specific counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Efforts have been made by Members of Congress to expand eligibility to include individuals in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico, as well as the entire states of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Legislation has also been proposed to include individuals in Guam affected by atomic weapons testing in the Pacific and fallout from the Trinity test in New Mexico. The 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act requested a study on the health effects of radiation exposure for downwinders. The National Research Council recommended a science-based approach for determining eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like location, outdoor time, and milk consumption. Exposure to fallout was influenced by various factors, with ingestion of Iodine being a significant pathway. The NRC report recommended a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits under the RECA program, based on absorbed dose of radionuclides estimated using geographic, demographic, and behavioral factors. This model would calculate the probability that an individual's specific cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, with Congress setting the threshold for awarding benefits. This approach is similar to methods used for eligibility under EEOICPA and VA disability compensation. The RECA program has never included downwinders in its eligibility criteria, which is based on geography rather than probability of causation. The NRC recommended a probability of causation model for evaluating claims, but this may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels. The NRC also stated that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to be a substantial cause of cancer. Congress may consider changes to eligibility criteria in response to the NRC report. The eligibility criteria for compensation under the RECA program may be adjusted by Congress, potentially leading to few successful claims. Current law limits benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation before 1972. Private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants post-1971 has continued uranium mining, milling, and transportation, prompting calls to expand RECA eligibility. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations, uranium miners are still at risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to those affected by atomic weapons tests and uranium mining. The proposed expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, beyond the original intent of the program. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients may be covered by state workers' compensation systems instead of RECA."
