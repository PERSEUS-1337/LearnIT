However, copyright holders like Taylor Swift do not have complete control over their music. For example, even though Swift removed her music from Spotify, a cover version of her album by Ryan Adams could still be heard on the service. Copyright law allows artists like Adams to perform, reproduce, and distribute Swift's music under certain conditions. Swift can withdraw her own recordings from Spotify, but she cannot control how the service uses other versions of her music. Ms. Swift's payment for her musical works and sound recordings is influenced by market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address music distribution on the internet, balancing combating piracy with protecting industry revenue sources. Different copyright provisions were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. Music distribution has since evolved to include webcasting, downloading, and on-demand streaming. The evolution of music consumption over the last 40 years is illustrated in Figure 1. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of the Napster file-sharing service. Apple's iTunes Music Store launched in 2003, offering legal options for purchasing songs online. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales, with Apple dominating the market. However, the rise of streaming services like Spotify led to a decline in digital downloads, prompting Apple to launch its own subscription service. Apple launched Apple Music in 2015 to compete with the threat to its iTunes store. The popularity of subscription music services has significantly changed music consumption patterns, with streaming services accounting for 67% of total U.S. recording industry retail spending in 2017. Despite this growth, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers is still below its 1999 peak, impacting how performers and music creators are compensated under copyright law. Owners of musical works and certain sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work. In music publishing, the combination of reproduction and distribution rights is known as a \"mechanical right,\" dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties from manufacturers for reproducing musical compositions in various formats. The term \"mechanical rights\" applies to the reproduction and distribution of music works. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings made permanent after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Services like webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services fall under this category. Rights for sound recording public performance under federal copyright laws are granted to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers purchase rights to listen to songs on CDs privately. Record labels pay music publishers for the right to distribute musical works. Radio stations do not pay public performance royalties to record labels but do pay music publishers and songwriters. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels. In 1995, Congress determined that broadcast radio airplay's promotional value outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Both traditional radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission. Ephemeral recordings fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand through conditional downloads. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters work with publishers to promote songs and collect royalties. Publishers may provide advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright. Music publishers work with songwriters to promote and generate revenue from their compositions by assigning a portion of the copyright. They handle mechanical licensing rights for various music formats and may contract with performing rights organizations for public performances. Royalty income is shared between songwriters, publishers, subpublishers, and coauthors. Major publishers dominate the industry, with Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Universal Music leading in U.S. revenue. Major publishers in the U.S. music industry include Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group. Independent publishers handle songwriting management, while writer-publishers control their own publishing rights. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. The parent companies of major record labels reproduce and distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings. The distribution role of record labels is evolving from physical to digital formats. They add data to identify royalties, negotiate with streaming services, and monitor sales. Recording artists may contract with labels or retain copyrights. Contracts typically involve transferring copyrights for a share of royalties. Record companies also finance recordings. Record companies finance music recordings, guide artists' careers, and may negotiate ownership of copyrights. The three major record labels in the U.S. are Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group. Independent record labels often rely on major labels for distribution. For example, Taylor Swift is signed to Big Machine Records, which has a distribution agreement with Universal Music Group. Chance the Rapper, an artist with his own copyrights, distributes music independently without signing with record labels. He earns from tours and merchandise, giving away music for free. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights to his album, Coloring Book. Record producers bring creative music to life, handling tasks like song selection and studio booking. Artists now work with multiple producers, controlling contract terms themselves. Producers in the music industry negotiate contracts with artists, controlling their compensation terms. Sound engineers oversee recording sessions, while mixers piece together finished products. Mixers typically receive one-time payments per track, but some may negotiate royalties like producers. The 1909 Copyright Act granted copyright owners the exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music. This act applied to musical works published after its enactment, allowing for mechanical licenses for audio-only reproductions distributed to the public. In response to concerns about a potential monopoly in the music industry, the 1909 Copyright Act established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allowed for the reproduction of musical works once they were distributed to the public, with a specified royalty rate. For example, when Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album in 2015, he paid a compulsory mechanical license fee set by the government. The royalty rate under the 1909 Copyright Act was $0.02 per \"part manufactured.\" The 1976 Copyright Act updated the mechanical license system, changing the royalty rate to be payable for each record made and distributed. Congress also defined \"phonorecord\" and established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses through serving a notice of intention to the copyright owner. The 1976 Copyright Act updated the mechanical license system by requiring licensees to serve a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office. Licensees must file the NOI within 30 days of making a new recording or before distributing it. Failure to provide the required NOI makes a potential licensee ineligible for a compulsory license and may result in copyright infringement. Additionally, copyright holders are no longer required to file a \"notice of use\" in the Copyright Office to recover against an unauthorized record manufacturer. Under current law, there may be no public record of the copyright owner triggering the NOI requirements for reproduction and distribution licenses. Controversy exists between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. Suggestions have been made to periodically adjust the statutory mechanical royalty rate and simplify the administration of compulsory licenses by establishing a separate royalty tribunal with Congress-set standards. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established by Congress in 2004 to set royalty rates for mechanical licenses. The CRB considers four policy objectives when determining rates, including maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions of both parties, and minimizing industry disruptions. The CRB, composed of three judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress, sets rates every five years for mechanical and other licensing categories. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets royalty rates for mechanical licenses every five years. Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act in 1995, amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover digital transmission of musical works. Rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries (DPDs) distinguish between incidental and general deliveries, sparking debate. The Copyright Office proposed new rules in 2008 due to Congress's delay in resolving the matter. In 2008, groups in the music industry reached a landmark agreement on mechanical licenses for streaming services, addressing concerns about declining revenues. The agreement required music streaming services to pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive streaming services like Pandora were exempt from obtaining mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted a modified version of this agreement in 2009, extending it through 2012. The CRB reached a new agreement with songwriters and online music services, setting mechanical royalty rates for various music streaming categories. Rates for physical deliveries and digital downloads are flat, while interactive streaming rates are based on formulas tied to service revenues. Publishers receive payments based on these formulas, with minimum per-subscriber payments for different service categories. The mechanical royalty rates for interactive music services vary depending on the category. During free trial periods, the rate is zero. Public performance royalties are overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission. To address licensing and payment for public performances, composers formed the American. Payment for public performances in various settings led to the formation of ASCAP in 1914, a performance rights organization. Songwriters and publishers assign public performance rights to PROs, who issue licenses to licensees. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license to perform musical works for a fee. SESAC, a competing PRO, was founded in 1930 to help European publishers and writers collect royalties in the U.S. ASCAP and SESAC split public performance royalties among publishers and songwriters. The growth of radio and decline in traditional revenue sources prompted action from both organizations. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. Broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. ASCAP and BMI had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses. When the licensing agreement with radio stations expired in 1940, three-quarters of stations prohibited ASCAP songs due to disagreement. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated ASCAP and BMI for antitrust violations due to a dispute over royalty rates. Both organizations entered consent decrees in 1941, with similar requirements such as nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory licensing terms, and accepting new members based on certain standards. ASCAP and BMI also offer alternative licenses to the blanket license, and federal district court judges can determine reasonable license fees for prospective licensees who cannot agree on royalty rates. The public performance of musical works is not bound by compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, while rates charged by SESAC and GMR are based on marketplace negotiations. Judges must determine that rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are \"reasonable\" and consider their market power. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. The public performance right for sound recordings was created by Congress in 1995 with the DPRA. Concerns about license fees affecting music performance royalties led to the creation of copyright laws for sound recordings in 1971. DOJ periodically reviews consent decrees with ASCAP and BMI, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to DOJ's interpretation. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was enacted to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. It applied to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972. States also passed antipiracy laws, and in 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. This was to prevent works from automatically entering the public domain. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws for pre-1972 works, allowing them to enter the public domain by 2067. Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to create temporary reproductions of sound recordings. SoundExchange manages public performance royalties for copyright owners of sound recordings. In the context of sound recording public performance royalties, copyright owners of sound recordings receive Section 112 fees, while recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not. The Copyright Act did not initially provide public performance rights to record labels and recording artists for their sound recordings. Amendments in the 1990s addressed this issue, granting record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 were key in this development. The DPRA and DMCA were key in granting record labels and artists public performance rights for their sound recordings. The DMCA expanded licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and set up rate-setting standards for the CRB. The CRB has a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services follow a different standard aimed at representing negotiated rates. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruptive impacts on industries, but its overall effect is hard to predict. The Section 801(b)(1) rate-setting standard aims to prevent disruption of existing services before July 31, 1998. It allows owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights. Interactive services pose a significant threat to traditional record sales, impacting copyright owners' ability to control and be paid for their work. Broadcast radio stations are not required to obtain public performance licenses for sound recordings. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 aimed to strike a balance among various parties regarding the sale of sound recordings and the benefits of airplay. Broadcast radio stations are distinguished from other services for providing a mix of entertainment and public interest activities to local communities. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Participants have a three-month negotiation period before the proceedings. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Parties have a three-month negotiation period before engaging in written statements, discovery, and attempting to reach a negotiated settlement. If no agreement is reached, the CRB may adopt proposed rates or hold an evidentiary hearing to issue a determination. Participants can request a rehearing or appeal CRB determinations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. SoundExchange, established by RIAA in 2000, is an independent entity that distributes royalties to record labels. The CRB sets rates for online music services based on the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. For preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services, percentage-of-revenue rates are used. Congress passed the Webcaster Settlement Acts to allow SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes. The CRB set rates for music streaming services based on revenue percentage. Agreements expired in 2015, leading to a rate proceeding for 2016-2020. Questions arose about using direct agreements as evidence due to a provision in 17 U.S.C. Section 114(f)(5)(C). SoundExchange, Pandora Media, and Clear Channel disagreed on the interpretation of this provision. The CRB issued its decision on rates for music streaming services for the 2016-2020 period, setting a rate of $0.17 per 100 streams for nonsubscription services in 2016. Annual rate increases from 2017 to 2020 are tied to the Consumer Price Index. The CRB also included recording fees with Section 114 royalties for this period. The CRB set ephemeral royalties fees at 5% of total Section 114 royalties for the 2016-2020 period. Public performance rates vary based on music service type and start date. Royalties under Section 114 are distributed with 50% to copyright owners, 45% to featured artists, and 2.5% each to agents for nonfeatured musicians and vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split but can be compensated through SoundExchange with a letter of direction from the artist. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services for setting rates for public performance rights is defined in 17 U.S.C. Section 114. The CRB has adopted these distinctions in setting rates for mechanical licenses. Record producers can be compensated through SoundExchange with a letter of direction from the artist. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre or similar to a selected artist is not \"interactive.\" The court's decision aimed to protect sound recording copyright holders from losing sales due to predictability in interactive services. LAUNCHcast, an online radio service by Launch Media, Inc., owned by Yahoo!, created unique playlists for users. The court ruled it as noninteractive, meeting requirements for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Noninteractive services must limit features like announcing specific songs in advance. The decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora could obtain statutory licenses for public performances. The CRB rates do not differentiate between customized services and others transmitting music. Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists. Users can listen for free with ads on their computers or pay $10 a month for ad-free listening on all devices. Congress granted antitrust exemptions for collective negotiation of royalty rates with SiriusXM and subscription services. The exemptions require nonexclusive common agents to preserve direct negotiation with copyright owners. The DPRA allows copyright owners to secure a statutory license directly, preventing supracompetitive rates. For interactive services, the DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for rate negotiations. Section 112 of the DMCA addresses ephemeral server reproductions and provides an antitrust exemption for negotiating royalty payments. The CRB was created in 2004 with the enactment of the DPRA. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 under the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act. It allows for the designation of an entity to receive royalties and ensures that parties can continue to make payments while appealing CRB decisions. SoundExchange was designated as the sole \"collective\" by the CRB in 2006. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" in 2006. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are designated agents, not entities like Royalty Logic. The CRB found that multiple collectives do not promote competition in statutory licensing. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" in 2006, citing the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for royalty rate-setting. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision in 2009, rejecting Royalty Logic's argument that multiple entities should receive payments under statutory licenses. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for receiving royalty payments, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single entity. SoundExchange was also designated as the sole collective for the period 2011-2014, with the CRB citing economic and administrative efficiency. In 2015, agreements were reached with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, approved by the CRB and binding on all copyright owners and performers. SoundExchange remained the sole collective for collecting and monitoring royalties. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting sound recording royalties from 2016-2020. Congress created an antitrust exemption for negotiating mechanical licenses, with music publishers using third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency to distribute royalties to songwriters. In 2015, SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association. Music publishers may issue mechanical licenses themselves. Competition among agents for licensing musical works was raised in 2006. Noncash considerations can affect the price interactive services pay for music access. Major labels acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify. Sony acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify, selling a portion when Spotify went public. Sony announced sharing proceeds with artists and independent labels. Music publishers can participate in deals for mechanical royalties tied to record label rates negotiated in the free market. Music publishers and record labels are concerned about fair payment from digital music services. ASCAP and BMI represent 90% of songs for licensing in the US, while SESAC and Global Music Rights also play a role. Publishers claim they are not receiving their fair share of performance royalties from streaming services due to restrictions in consent decrees. They have been pressuring ASCAP and BMI to allow them to negotiate deals independently since 2011. In response to pressure from music publishers, ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow publishers to license their public performance rights for digital streaming services directly. However, courts ruled that publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights and must be \"all in\" or \"all out\" of the PRO. Major publishers and PROs then sought modifications to consent decrees to permit partial grants of rights. The DOJ evaluated consent decrees in 2014, seeking comments on \"100% licensing\" vs. \"fractional licensing.\" They concluded in 2016 that 100% licensing is required for ASCAP and BMI, promoting competition. DOJ called on Congress to reconsider copyright law in the music industry. The DOJ called on Congress to reconsider copyright law in the music industry, noting that a more comprehensive legislative solution may be preferable. BMI filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York regarding fractional licensing under the consent decree, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Copyright Office announced new procedures for filing Notices of Intention to reproduce and distribute musical works under Section 115. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures for filing Notices of Intention (NOIs) to reproduce and distribute musical works under Section 115, allowing licensees to file up to 100 songs at once, reducing filing costs significantly. Digital music service companies like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the change. This move aimed to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers by digitizing the compulsory licensing process. The Music Modernization Act, passed in April 2018, aims to address copyright issues with online music services like Spotify. It creates a new nonprofit licensing collective funded by these services to offer blanket licenses. Additionally, the bill changes the process for suing for infringement, sets royalty rates, and extends copyright protection to older sound recordings. The Music Modernization Act, passed in April 2018, aims to address copyright issues with online music services by creating a new nonprofit licensing collective. This collective would offer blanket licenses and establish procedures for royalty payments to producers, mixers, and sound engineers for sound recordings. Online music services would fund the collective through assessments reviewed by the Copyright Royalty Board every five years. The Mechanical Licensing Collective would have a 17-member board of directors and be responsible for maintaining a musical works database and administering blanket licenses. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would be responsible for offering blanket licenses, identifying musical works, locating copyright owners, and distributing royalties from online music services to rights holders. Songwriters would receive at least 50% of all royalties for unmatched works. The MLC would not negotiate royalty rates, grant licenses for public performances, or engage in government lobbying activities. The digital licensing coordinator would establish governance structures and membership criteria. The digital licensing coordinator would establish governance structures, membership criteria, and enforce notice and payment obligations. The collective would not engage in government lobbying activities. Failure to provide usage reports or royalties would result in default of the blanket license. Legal recourse options include seeking review in federal court or bringing a claim for unresolved issues. Copyright owners are prohibited from suing online music services with valid blanket licenses. The Music Modernization Act allows copyright owners to recover royalties under a new system if they file a lawsuit against online music services for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of musical works. The online music service must show compliance with specified requirements to avoid damages. The Copyright Royalty Board must use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for setting royalty rates. The Music Modernization Act allows copyright owners to recover royalties through a new system for unauthorized use of musical works by online music services. Judges in the Southern District of New York can now consider sound recording public performance rates for online services and satellite digital audio services. The system for assigning judges for ASCAP and BMI cases will change to a random process for rate setting cases. The House Judiciary Committee report states that judges in the Southern District of New York will now randomly assign rate decisions for sound recording public performance. Copyright owners of pre-1972 sound recordings can receive payments from digital music services, along with legal remedies like damages and attorney's fees. To be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees, rights owners must file specific information with the Copyright Office within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The bill provides federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The entity distributing royalties must be a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB. Legislators have introduced additional measures related to the music industry. In January 2017, Senator John Barrasso and Representative Michael Conaway introduced resolutions supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act, stating that Congress should not impose new fees on radio stations for playing sound recordings. In April 2017, Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, giving copyright owners the right to withdraw their music from broadcast radio stations unless royalties are paid. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. In October 2017, Representative Hakeem Jeffries introduced the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, to establish a Copyright Claims Board for copyright owners to protect their work. In May 2018, Senator Ron Wyden introduced the ACCESS to Recordings Act, S. 2933, to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings. The bill, S. 2933, aims to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. It allows rights holders to receive payments from digital services for public performances of their works. Pre-1972 sound recording copyright owners must give timely notice of infringement to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees. These recordings would enter the public domain 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 would be protected until December 31, 2025. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 will be protected until December 31, 2025, as long as the copyright owner engages in commercial exploitation, complies with regulations, and notifies the Register of Copyrights. Failure to meet these requirements will result in the recordings entering the public domain."
