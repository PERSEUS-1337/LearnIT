    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Energy High Energy and Nuclear Physics Authorization Act of 1994\". SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\nCERN refers to the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Construction includes all activities necessary for project completion. Conventional construction involves civil works and infrastructure. The Department refers to the Department of Energy. The Large Hadron Collider project is at CERN. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Energy. Authorized appropriations for high energy physics activities of the Department of Energy include $695.4 million for fiscal year 1996, $719.7 million for fiscal year 1997, $744.9 million for fiscal year 1998, and $713.6 million for fiscal year 1999. Funds can be used for the B-factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the Fermilab Main Injector. No funds are authorized for US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project until international agreement is certified. For nuclear physics activities, $337.1 million is authorized for fiscal year 1996, with a portion allocated for decontamination and decommissioning of the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. Authorized appropriations for high energy physics activities of the Department of Energy include funding for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. No funds may be expended for high energy and nuclear physics facility construction projects exceeding $100,000,000 without specific authorization in a non-appropriations Act. SEC. 4. THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER PROJECT. The Secretary will negotiate with CERN for US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project, ensuring fair cost allocation, cost control, and reconsideration of US involvement if project milestones are not met. The Secretary will negotiate with CERN for US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project, ensuring fair cost allocation, cost control, and reconsideration of US involvement if project milestones are not met. This Act does not prevent the President from engaging in negotiations for international science agreements, including access conditions for scientists to the facility. SEC. 5. OPERATING PLAN.\n\nThe Secretary must submit a plan for the operations of high energy and nuclear physics activities within 30 days of any Act appropriating funds. The plan should reflect the appropriated amounts.\n\nSEC. 6. LONG-RANGE PLANNING AND GOVERNANCE. The Secretary is required to contract an independent organization to review the governance of the Department's high energy and nuclear physics programs, including performance evaluation, regulatory compliance, and advisory group representation. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 9 months detailing the review of high energy and nuclear physics programs. A long-range plan for these programs will be prepared every two years, including research opportunities and facility relevance analysis. The long-range plan for high energy and nuclear physics programs must include an analysis of facility operations, research support, program schedules, international coordination efforts, and modifications from previous plans. The Secretary will transmit a copy of the original plan to Congress. The long-range plan for high energy and nuclear physics programs, including facility operations, research support, program schedules, and international coordination efforts, will be submitted with the President's annual budget request to Congress for fiscal year 1997 and subsequent odd-numbered fiscal years. The budget requests will distinguish between capital expenditures and other activities for high energy and nuclear physics programs."
