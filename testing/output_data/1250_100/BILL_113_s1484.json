    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sabine National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2013\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Sabine National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2013 defines key terms such as \"Authority\" as the Sabine River Authority of Texas, \"Federal land\" as National Forest System land within Sabine National Forest and Toledo Bend Project boundary, and \"non-Federal land\" as land not owned by the federal government. The term \"non-Federal land\" refers to privately owned land adjacent to Sabine National Forest, to be owned or acquired by the Sabine River Authority of Texas and mutually agreed upon by the Secretary of Agriculture. The terms \"Secretary\" and \"Toledo Bend Project\" are also defined in the context of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project numbered 2305. Additionally, the terms \"wilderness area\" and \"wilderness candidate land\" are defined in relation to the Indian Mounds Wilderness Area in Sabine National Forest. SEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE, SABINE NATIONAL FOREST. In exchange for non-Federal land, wilderness candidate land, and any cash payment, the Secretary will convey all US interests in Federal land to the Authority. The conveyance is subject to existing rights. An appraisal of the surface estate of all lands involved must be completed within 180 days, following specific appraisal standards. The Secretary will account for limitations on Federal land use after conveyance, determine land acreage through surveys, share exchange costs equally with the Authority, and conduct the land exchange on an equal value basis with cash equalization. The Secretary may use cash equalization payments to equalize land values, with excess amounts deposited into the Sisk Act fund for land acquisition. Title to non-Federal land conveyed must meet Secretary's approval and Attorney General's standards. The Federal Government reserves mineral estate in conveyed land, with restrictions on usage for conservation purposes. The Authority can operate Forest Service campgrounds after land exchange, completion within 1 year of enactment. SEC. 4. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT, INDIAN MOUNDS WILDERNESS AREA, SABINE NATIONAL FOREST. Boundary Adjustment: After completing the land exchange, the Secretary will adjust the boundaries of the wilderness area. This includes removing land within the Toledo Bend Project and adding acquired wilderness candidate land to the wilderness area. The Secretary must also provide a map and legal description to the relevant committees. The House of Representatives and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will receive a map and legal description of the boundary changes to the wilderness area resulting from the land exchange. The filed map and description will have the same legal effect as if included in the Act, with the Secretary allowed to correct errors. The map and description will also be available for public inspection at Forest Service offices."
