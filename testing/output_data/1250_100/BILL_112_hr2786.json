    "content": "The \"Holocaust Survivors Assistance Act of 2011\" aims to provide preference for services to older individuals who are Holocaust survivors, designate a responsible individual within the Administration on Aging for them, and create a grant program to enhance transportation services for this group. The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of the Holocaust, with millions of Jews and others murdered by the Nazis. There are approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors in the US, many of whom are aging and in need of additional support. A large portion of survivors are over 75 years old, with many living in poverty, especially those who emigrated from the former Soviet Union after 1965. Holocaust survivors in the United States, constituting an extremely vulnerable population, continue to live with mental and physical scars from the trauma of the Holocaust. Institutionalized settings can have adverse effects on survivors, reintroducing triggers that induce panic and re-traumatization. Approximately two-thirds of survivors live alone, which is a risk factor for institutionalization. Low-income survivors rely heavily on social service programs for personal care, meals, transportation, counseling, and mental health support. The Older Americans Act of 1965 is amended to define a \"Holocaust survivor\" as an individual who lived in a country under Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945, was persecuted on various bases, and was a member of a group persecuted by the Nazis. SEC. 104 of the Older Americans Act is amended to include \"older individuals who are Holocaust survivors\" in certain paragraphs. Section 306 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 is amended to include \"older individuals who are Holocaust survivors\" in specific paragraphs. Section 306 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 is amended to include \"older individuals who are Holocaust survivors\" in specific paragraphs, emphasizing their placement and support in various areas. SEC. 106 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 is amended to include \"older individuals who are Holocaust survivors\" in specific paragraphs related to state plans. This amendment emphasizes support for this specific group within the Act. SEC. 108 amends the Older Americans Act to include older individuals who are Holocaust survivors. SEC. 109 addresses the prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, adding protection for older individuals who are Holocaust survivors. TITLE II establishes the Administration on Aging. The Administration on Aging is authorized to designate a person responsible for Holocaust survivors. Innovation to improve transportation for older Holocaust survivors is addressed in the Older Americans Act. The Assistant Secretary will award grants to nonprofit organizations to improve transportation services for older individuals, with a focus on Holocaust survivors. The grants will be for a minimum of 5 years. Funds must be used for demonstration projects or technical assistance to coordinate transportation services for older Holocaust survivors. The organization may carry out activities to improve access to transportation services for older individuals, including developing innovative approaches, preparing information on transportation options, and creating models for comprehensive integrated transportation services. The Assistant Secretary provides ongoing technical assistance and special services to link older individuals to transportation services. Preference is given to organizations with experience working with Holocaust survivors. Consultation with designated individuals and national organizations is required to improve transportation assistance for Holocaust survivors. Entities eligible for grants or contracts must have experience working with older individuals, including Holocaust survivors. The Assistant Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress on the status and needs of older individuals who are Holocaust survivors."
