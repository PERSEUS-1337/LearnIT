    "content": "The Act titled \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" is cited as the short title. Congress acknowledges the importance of promoting competition and reducing regulation in telecommunications markets, especially for local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. These carriers play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of advanced services in less densely populated regions, but existing regulations often hinder their progress. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in telecommunications for the benefit of consumers in all regions of the Nation, in line with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, improving flexibility and allowing resources to be redirected towards increasing investment in initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers to reduce regulatory requirements and encourage investment in initiatives. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. No additional review is needed if the rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Size-based differentiation among carriers is not prohibited by this section. The Act prohibits size-based differentiation among carriers, effective for rules adopted after the enactment date. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services, and they are not obligated to maintain separate operations or personnel. The text discusses the ability of a two percent carrier to participate or withdraw from participation in a common line tariff administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. They can also elect to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for specific study areas. The carrier's election is binding for one year. A two percent carrier's election under 310(f)(3) is binding for one year from the date of the election. The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for rate structures. This includes services not previously offered that expand options for customers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under Section 286. The Act allows two percent carriers to adjust interstate rates quickly and file contract-based tariffs upon certification of competition in their service area. This streamlined process aims to promote pricing flexibility and competition in the telecommunications market. The Act allows two percent carriers to participate in common line tariffs and provide facilities-based entry in their service areas without tariffing interstate service offerings. The term 'contract-based tariff' refers to a tariff based on a service contract between a carrier and customers, detailing contract terms, services provided, volume commitments, prices, discounts, and other regulations. The term 'service area' is defined as in section 214(e)(5) of the Act. SEC. 287 of the Act provides savings provisions regarding the authority of the Commission, rights of rural telephone companies, and state authority over intrastate communications services. SEC. 5 imposes limitations on merger reviews. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a deadline for making public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must make determinations within 60 days of receiving an application, or the application will be deemed approved. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a deadline for public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. Applications submitted after the enactment date will be deemed approved without conditions. Applications pending at the enactment date will be subject to the new requirements. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. The Commission must issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act results in relief being granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. Any order issued is final and may be appealed. Effective immediately for new petitions, pending petitions subject to new requirements. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS.\n\nExceptions to the 60-day and 90-day time periods for petitions or applications under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are raised by Executive Branch agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, or the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
