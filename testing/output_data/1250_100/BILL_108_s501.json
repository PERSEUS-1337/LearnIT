It highlights the advanced capabilities of elementary school gifted students and the varied needs of students in classrooms.

Public schools play a crucial role in providing services for high-ability students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Parents are essential partners in developing appropriate educational services for gifted students. Gifted and talented students require access to information, research, and support for their educational, social, and emotional needs. There is no federal requirement to identify or serve the approximately 3,000,000 gifted students in the nation. State and local disparities in resources and services for gifted students exist, impacting their education and future success.
