    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Berta Caceres Human Rights in Honduras Act\". Congress finds that the Honduran police are corrupt and commit human rights abuses with impunity, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder. The New York Times revealed documents showing top officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators, and individuals with records of human rights abuses are appointed to high positions. International human rights bodies report that the Honduran military and police also commit abuses with impunity. The Honduran police are involved in corruption and human rights abuses, including killings, with impunity. Reports from various sources highlight the chronic problem of lethal force by the national police, inefficiency in investigations, and slow prosecution of officials charged with violations. Efforts to clean up the police have largely failed, with minimal progress in prosecuting corrupt members and addressing human rights abuses. Rights Action documented the involvement of the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces in killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley. Human Rights Watch confirmed these killings went unpunished, with only one private actor convicted. Assassinations of activists, such as Jose Angel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George, continue. Additionally, there are further examples of human rights abuses by the military, including the shooting of Tomas Garcia, a Lenca Indigenous activist, during a peaceful protest in July 2013. The Honduran military has been involved in various human rights abuses, including torture and killings of civilians. The government has expanded the military's role in domestic policing, leading to disastrous consequences such as the deaths of unarmed individuals at checkpoints. The creation of a Military Police force has resulted in increased allegations of human rights abuses. The Honduran military has been implicated in human rights abuses, with reports of corruption and ties to organized crime. The justice system is described as weak, with widespread impunity for crimes. Efforts to reform security institutions have been ineffective, leading to ongoing crime and human rights violations. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in 2016 highlights the dangers faced by those speaking out against injustice. Indigenous activist Berta Caceres, known for defending land rights against a dam project, was killed in Honduras. The government failed to protect her despite numerous threats. Eight suspects, including military ties, have been arrested, raising questions about military involvement in her assassination. The Government of Honduras obstructs access to the case file related to Berta Caceres' assassination. Despite international calls for an independent investigation, the Honduran government refuses to allow the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to probe the case. Various activists and critics in Honduras face severe risks due to corruption and human rights abuses, with past abuses largely going unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina highlights the ongoing risks faced by activists in Honduras. Funding from the US and Inter-American Development Bank has been allocated to the Honduran police and military, with calls for increased security funding in the future. SEC. 3. Suspension of security assistance to Honduras' police and military, including equipment and training. The Secretary of the Treasury to vote against loans for Honduran police and military at multilateral development banks. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders, prosecuted human rights violators in the military and police, withdrawn the military from domestic policing, and ensured cooperation in such cases. The Honduran government, in accordance with the Constitution, has separated domestic police functions from the Armed Forces, protecting the rights of various groups and ensuring a capable judicial system to prosecute human rights abuses by police and military members."
