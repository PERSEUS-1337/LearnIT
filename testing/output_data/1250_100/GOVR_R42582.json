    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean reflects the diversity of the region, with some countries still receiving aid for various challenges while others have outgrown the need for assistance. Despite progress, foreign aid continues to play a role in advancing U.S. policy in the region, with Congress overseeing aid programs and budget deficits impacting current efforts. Efforts to reduce budget deficits post-global financial crisis have led to closer scrutiny of foreign assistance. Spending cuts may impact aid to Latin America and the Caribbean. This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to the region, including historical trends and the Obama Administration's FY2013 request. Congressional considerations and funding provisions are also discussed. The United States has been a significant provider of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1960s. Aid increased during the Alliance for Progress under President Kennedy to counter Soviet and Cuban influence. Support continued in the 1980s for the Contras and governments fighting leftist insurgencies. Aid decreased in the mid-1990s but rose again in the late 1990s due to humanitarian spending. The United States provided increased levels of assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, including humanitarian aid after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and support through initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC. Aid also focused on counternarcotics and security programs, with significant assistance to Colombia and its neighbors under \"Plan Colombia.\" The United States provided increased levels of assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, including support through initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC. Aid focused on counternarcotics and security programs, with significant assistance to Colombia and its Andean neighbors under \"Plan Colombia.\" In FY2008, President Bush announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico and Central America, followed by the creation of CARSI and CBSI in FY2010 by the Obama Administration. However, U.S. assistance to the region has been declining since FY2010, with a decrease in aid levels each year. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia, and Europe decreased between FY2008 and FY2012. Aid to South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa increased during the same period due to shifting priorities in U.S. foreign policy. This reflects changes in the world and a focus on countries of strategic importance for anti-terrorism efforts. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean as a proportion of total foreign aid dropped from 10% to under 8% during this time. Since taking office, the Obama Administration has increased aid to Latin America and the Caribbean for development and humanitarian assistance programs. Development aid focuses on economic progress, social stability, and long-term projects in areas like economic reform, education, health, and environmental protection. Humanitarian aid is for immediate relief in emergencies, including food assistance and support for refugees. USAID manages most programs, with the State Department overseeing some accounts like Migration and Refugee Assistance. Economic Support Fund (ESF) is another significant source of U.S. assistance to the region. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) account provides funding for programs that promote U.S. economic, political, and security interests in the region. Managed by USAID and the State Department, ESF-funded programs focus on political and economic stability. Additionally, the United States supports security assistance programs in the region through accounts like International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) for counternarcotics efforts and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, De-mining, and Related programs (NADR) for addressing global threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation. The United States provides support to Latin American and Caribbean militaries through various accounts like Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET). Aid levels to the region have decreased, leading to a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance. In FY2012, over $730 million was provided for development and humanitarian programs, with an additional $466 million for U.S. strategic interests through the ESF account. The United States provided nearly $700 million in FY2012 through aid accounts to support security efforts in Latin American and Caribbean countries, representing 37% of total U.S. bilateral assistance to the region. Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico are top recipients of U.S. foreign aid, with a focus on long-term development in key sectors like energy, infrastructure, basic services, and governance. U.S. aid to Colombia has decreased as the country has improved its security situation and taken on more responsibility for programs. The United States has shifted its assistance in Latin America towards economic and social development efforts, with a focus on supporting countries in their fight against criminal organizations. Aid levels have decreased as the emphasis moved away from security equipment to rule of law programs. In FY2012, the U.S. provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, totaling over 56% of all aid to the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request would continue the downward trend in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with a requested $1.7 billion for the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes widespread proposed cuts in funding for the region, except for Development Assistance. Countries like Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Guyana would see significant cuts, while Colombia and Mexico would experience the largest declines in assistance. El Salvador is the only country set to receive a substantial increase in aid due to the \"Partnership for Growth Initiative.\" The emphasis of U.S. aid in the region is shifting towards development and humanitarian assistance, with a 4% decrease in total funding compared to FY2012. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes proposed cuts in funding, with a focus on development and humanitarian assistance. The request includes $434 million through the Economic Support Fund account, representing a 7% decline from FY2012. Security assistance would account for 33% of U.S. aid, with a 19% decrease for Latin America and the Caribbean compared to FY2012. The distribution of assistance shows 36% for Mexico and Central America, 29% for the Caribbean, and 27% for the Andean nations of South America. The United States provided Mexico and Central America with foreign assistance worth $27.5 billion between FY1980 and FY2010, with over 91% in economic assistance. Central America received the most aid, with El Salvador accounting for 33% of the assistance. U.S. assistance to the region has declined since the 1980s. During the 1980s, the United States provided Mexico and Central America with $12.8 billion in foreign aid to combat Soviet influence and support allied governments. Aid declined in the 1990s and further decreased between FY2000 and FY2009 to about $5.9 billion. Despite the decline, new aid initiatives benefited countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico through programs like the M\u00e9rida Initiative. In FY2010, Mexico and Central America received almost $1.3 billion in U.S. assistance, with 57% going to Mexico. In FY2011 and FY2012, they received $532.4 million and $696.2 million respectively. The Administration's FY2013 request for the sub-region is $619.8 million, with Mexico receiving $269.5 million. This is a decrease from the previous year due to a shift in the M\u00e9rida Initiative towards combating transnational organized crime. In FY2013, U.S. assistance to Mexico focuses on providing technology, training, and equipment to strengthen law enforcement entities at federal and state levels, combat transnational criminal organizations, and support justice sector reform efforts. Aid also includes human rights training and equipment for the Mexican military, partnerships with universities, institutional reforms for private sector competitiveness, and climate change mitigation efforts. Congress requires withholding 15% of assistance until certain human rights conditions are met. Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala face challenges in combating organized crime. They receive security assistance through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). Guatemala would receive $93.6 million in U.S. assistance in FY2013, with a focus on development projects, food security, healthcare, and security force training. U.S. assistance to Guatemala has had conditions since 2005. The U.S. assistance to Honduras in FY2013 would support governance decentralization, service delivery improvement, transparency in elections, education quality enhancement, and food security strategy implementation. Health aid would back the national HIV/AIDS strategy and health system reform. Security forces training and equipment aim to enhance civil-military relations and government control in remote areas. 20% of FY2012 assistance for Honduran security forces is withheld until human rights conditions are met. El Salvador would receive $41.8 million in U.S. assistance in FY2013, an increase of $12.6 million from FY2012. It is part of the Partnership for Growth initiative to promote economic development by addressing crime, insecurity, and competitiveness issues. Most of the assistance is allocated for security and justice sector reforms, anti-corruption efforts, education system improvements, and private sector competitiveness. Training and equipment for security forces to strengthen border control are also included. U.S. assistance to Nicaragua would decrease by $390,000 under the FY2013 request, remaining almost 46% lower than in FY2011. Aid to the country has declined due to difficult relations with President Daniel Ortega and concerns about democratic governance erosion. Majority of funds for Nicaragua would be directed towards democracy promotion projects, market-oriented economic policies, and resource management. Some assistance would go to the Nicaraguan military as a counternarcotics partner. USAID Missions in Belize and Costa Rica closed in 1996, and the Mission in Panama is expected to close in September 2012. In 1996, the USAID Mission in Panama is expected to close in September 2012. Despite this, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama continue to receive U.S. assistance, with a $6.4 million FY2013 request, a 56% increase over FY2012. This assistance includes equipment and training for security forces to combat drug trafficking and security threats. Additionally, there is $29.7 million for USAID's Central America Regional program, focusing on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, trade capacity building, and supporting Central American priorities. The Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) receives funding through the regional program to support U.S. and Central American security objectives. CARSI funds activities for narcotics interdiction, disrupting criminal networks, and improving law enforcement and justice sector institutions in the region. Additionally, CARSI supports prevention efforts for the safety and security of citizens in Central America. CARSI, funded through the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program, supports prevention efforts to reduce drug demand and provide opportunities for at-risk youth in Central America. The State Department has not publicly disclosed the breakdown of CARSI funding by country. From FY1980 to FY2010, the United States provided almost $14 billion in assistance to the Caribbean, with the majority being economic aid. In the 1990s, U.S. assistance to the Caribbean declined to about $3 billion in 2010 dollars. Haiti's share of U.S. aid increased to 46%, followed by Jamaica (22%) and the Dominican Republic (15%). From FY2000 to FY2009, U.S. assistance to the Caribbean increased to almost $3.9 billion in 2010 dollars, with Haiti receiving 52% of the total aid. Significant assistance was also provided for hurricane recovery and reconstruction to several Caribbean countries, especially Grenada, Haiti, and Jamaica. In FY2010, aid to the region increased to almost $1.7 billion, largely due to Haiti's devastating earthquake. In FY2010, a new Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was initiated to increase assistance to Caribbean countries for reducing illicit trafficking and promoting social justice. U.S. aid to the Caribbean totaled $572 million in FY2011 and $522 million in FY2012, with a requested amount of $492 million for FY2013. Haiti received the majority of funding, comprising two-thirds of all assistance in FY2011 and FY2012, and over two-thirds in FY2013. Haiti's reconstruction remains a key focus of U.S. assistance. The U.S. government's post-earthquake strategy for Haiti focuses on infrastructure, food security, health services, and governance. Thomas C. Adams is the Special Coordinator for Haiti, overseeing assistance efforts. USAID leads the assistance program, collaborating with other U.S. agencies, the Haitian government, and international partners. Over 1.5 million Haitians were initially in tent camps post-earthquake, with 36% still displaced as of early 2012. U.S. and international efforts in Haiti post-earthquake focus on aiding the 550,000 people remaining in displaced camps and addressing a cholera outbreak. The FY2013 foreign aid request includes programs for various Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program in Barbados would provide assistance. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program in Barbados would support assistance activities for Barbados and the six countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Almost two-thirds of the aid would focus on HIV/AIDS programs. The USAID Mission in Barbados would also manage HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Dominican Republic, over half of the $29.8 million FY2013 request would support global health activities, while DA would fund projects to strengthen government institutions, civil society, education, small businesses, and natural resources. For Cuba, $15 million is requested for humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families. In FY2009 to FY2012, Congress allocated $20 million annually for humanitarian assistance in Cuba, with concerns delaying aid provision in 2010 and 2011. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor, has been imprisoned in Cuba since 2009 for distributing communications equipment. In Guyana, the FY2013 bilateral request is nearly $7 million, reflecting reduced assistance due to improved HIV/AIDS efforts. In Jamaica, the FY2013 bilateral request is for $5.4 million to support basic education, climate change adaptation, and regional HIV/AIDS assistance. Additionally, $59 million is requested for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative to combat illicit trafficking and promote security and social justice in the region. The CBSI was developed by the Obama Administration in 2009 and has received funding totaling $203 million since FY2010. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) includes assistance in maritime and aerial security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border/port security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. The breakdown of CBSI assistance by country is not provided in the State Department's annual budget justification, making it difficult to determine the overall aid levels. U.S. assistance under the CBSI likely exceeds regular bilateral aid for many Caribbean nations. From FY1980 to FY2010, the U.S. provided about $25 billion in assistance to Andean countries, with Colombia receiving the highest amount followed by Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Since the 1980s, U.S. assistance to the Andean region has focused on development, food aid, and narcotics-related assistance to reduce illicit drug flow. Aid to Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador has increased over the years, with Colombia receiving the most significant share for initiatives like Plan Colombia. From FY2000 to FY2009, aid to the region doubled to about $14.3 billion in 2010 dollars, with Colombia receiving the majority of assistance. In the 1980s, U.S. aid to the Andean region focused on development, food aid, and narcotics-related assistance to combat illicit drug flow. Aid to Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador increased over the years, with Colombia receiving the most significant share through initiatives like Plan Colombia. From FY2000 to FY2009, aid to the region doubled to $14.3 billion in 2010 dollars. In FY2010, aid to the Andean region totaled $1.2 billion, with Colombia receiving almost 70% of the aid, followed by Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In FY2011 and FY2012, Colombia accounted for 73% of aid to the region, with a decrease in assistance requested for FY2013. The FY2013 request for U.S. assistance in the Andean region shows a decline in aid for Bolivia (22%), Colombia (12%), Peru (11%), and Venezuela (50%). Colombia receives the majority of assistance at $332 million, reflecting progress in security and self-sustainability. U.S. support focuses on Colombia's National Consolidation Plan to establish state control in areas previously controlled by armed groups through security, counternarcotics, and development initiatives. U.S. assistance in the Andean region, primarily through the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative, supports various initiatives including drug eradication, capacity building for security forces, land restitution reforms, and human rights protection. Assistance for Peru aims to strengthen democracy, social inclusion, governance, and environmental stewardship. The U.S. assistance in Bolivia focuses on social services, education reforms, conservation, and poverty alleviation in rural areas. A significant portion of the aid is from the INCLE account, supporting drug eradication, anti-money laundering efforts, and judicial system strengthening. U.S.-Bolivian relations have deteriorated since 2008, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance. The aid also targets health sector activities to reduce maternal and child mortality and promote family planning services. The U.S. provides aid to Bolivia for social services, education reforms, conservation, and poverty alleviation. Assistance includes support for drug eradication, anti-money laundering, and strengthening the judicial system. In Ecuador, funding from the DA account would support alternative development programs, local governments, economic development, and biodiversity conservation. Aid from the INCLE account would enhance counternarcotics operations. In Venezuela, the U.S. has traditionally provided limited support for counternarcotics efforts. The United States has traditionally provided limited assistance to Venezuela due to its oil wealth. Recent aid has focused on democracy assistance, with $3 million requested for FY2013. Overall, the U.S. provided $1.6 billion in foreign assistance to Brazil and Southern Cone countries between FY1980 and FY2010, with the majority in economic aid. Between FY1980 and FY2010, the United States provided significant assistance to Brazil and the Southern Cone countries, with Brazil receiving the most aid at 36%, followed by Paraguay (29%), Chile (17%), Argentina (11%), and Uruguay (7%). Aid increased in each decade, reaching $741 million in 2010 dollars between FY2000 and FY2009. In FY2010, Brazil and the Southern Cone countries received $109 million in U.S. aid. Additionally, in FY2011 and FY2012, the U.S. provided $33.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively, in current U.S. dollars through State Department and USAID appropriations. The Administration's FY2013 request for the sub-region is $14.4 million, a $9.4 million (40%) decrease from the FY2012 estimate. Brazil accounted for over 70% of the combined appropriations for the sub-region in FY2011 and FY2012. Under the FY2013 request, Brazil would receive $6.2 million in U.S. assistance, transitioning from supporting development programs to promoting development in third countries. About one-third of FY2013 aid would be used to strengthen the Brazilian government's development agency and implement projects in other developing countries, focusing on agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs. The FY2013 request for Brazil includes support for HIV/AIDS programs, counternarcotics, and security efforts, as well as cooperation between Brazilian and U.S. military forces. Paraguay would receive $5.9 million to improve justice sector transparency, civil service oversight, and small farmers' productivity. Assistance for Paraguay also includes support for security efforts through training and equipment for the military. In FY2013, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, as upper-middle-income economies, would receive a combined $2.3 million in U.S. aid. Argentina and Chile would also receive $270,000 each in NADR funds for port security and anti-terrorism initiatives. The State Department and USAID administer regional programs for Latin America and the Caribbean, including CARSI for Central America and CBSI for the Caribbean. The State Department and USAID administer regional programs for Latin America and the Caribbean, including CARSI for Central America and CBSI for the Caribbean. Other regional programs include USAID's Central America, Latin America, and South America Regional programs, as well as State Department-managed initiatives for international humanitarian assistance and efforts to counter transnational crime and drug trafficking. The Western Hemisphere Regional program also funds initiatives for economic opportunity, clean energy security, climate change mitigation, and security-related assistance. The Western Hemisphere Regional program funding has decreased significantly in recent years, with a 34% decline in FY2013. The program supports various initiatives including U.S. participation in the Sixth Summit of the Americas, antiterrorism assistance, energy security, and climate change efforts through the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA). The Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) is supported by U.S. funding and involves regional cooperation on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and climate change adaptation. The initiative includes countries like Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Organization of American States (OAS). Additionally, the Pathways to Prosperity in the Americas initiative aims to ensure shared trade benefits and cooperation on development issues among 15 hemispheric nations. The USAID's Latin American and Caribbean Regional program, supported by the IDB, OAS, and ECLAC/CEPAL, focuses on promoting economic growth and opportunity for marginalized groups. Funding for the program in FY2011 was almost $53 million, with efforts to prevent crime, strengthen education, and address climate change. GHP assistance complements these efforts by improving access to health services. The South America Regional program also supports economic growth and environmental initiatives. The regional program, funded at $9.8 million in FY2011 and $15.6 million in FY2012, focuses on economic growth, environmental conservation, and health programs. It includes initiatives such as the Initiative for Conservation in the Andean Amazon (ICAA) and the Andean Trade Capacity Building Program. GHP funding supports the Amazon Malaria Initiative (AMI) in seven South American countries. The State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration oversees MRA funding worldwide, including assistance for Latin America to support internally displaced persons in Colombia and refugees in neighboring countries. MRA funding also supports regional programs of UNHCR, ICRC, and IOM in the Caribbean region, including Haiti. The ICRC provides support for health care, water systems improvement, and monitoring of prison conditions in Haiti. INCLE assistance in Latin America is administered by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Programs include aviation support for counternarcotics in Colombia, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Peru. INCLE funds also support law enforcement academies in El Salvador and Peru, as well as an anti-gang program in Central America. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on humanitarian, counterdrug, and counterterrorism efforts. Congress has granted DOD legislative authorities for these activities, which often serve institutional needs and training for the U.S. Armed Forces. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides humanitarian assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean through U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). Congress authorizes DOD to engage in various humanitarian activities, including disaster relief and emergency response. In FY2010, DOD allocated $84 million in humanitarian assistance for projects in 28 countries, with Haiti receiving the largest amount after the 2010 earthquake. DOD provides humanitarian assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean through NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM. DOD assists partner countries in preparing for and responding to natural disasters. SOUTHCOM deployed a team to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, restoring air traffic control and providing humanitarian supplies. DOD also offers counterdrug support to the region. The State Department coordinates U.S. counterdrug assistance, while DOD has independent counterdrug authorities. DOD provides foreign counterdrug support through training, transportation, reconnaissance, and infrastructure construction. In FY2010, DOD gave the region $435 million in counterdrug aid, with Colombia and Mexico as the top recipients. Some countries also received DOD assistance for counterterrorism and stabilization activities. Between FY2006 and FY2010, DOD provided funding for training and equipping foreign military and maritime security forces in Latin America and the Caribbean under Section 1206 and 1207 of the FY2006 NDAA. A total of $72.1 million was allocated to 10 countries for counterterrorism operations and stability support. Additionally, $67.5 million was provided to six countries for small-scale security and stabilization activities. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) also plays a role in providing grants for grassroots development in the region. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) has provided almost 5,000 grants worth $695 million to local and community-based groups for development projects. Grant recipients are expected to contribute their own resources or mobilize resources from other sources, totaling about $1 billion since the agency's establishment. In FY2011, the IAF awarded 61 new grants and provided 33 supplements in areas such as agriculture, education, enterprise development, corporate social investment, cultural expression, environment, health, and legal assistance. Grant recipients were spread throughout the region, with a focus on the Andean region and Central America. In FY2011, the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) awarded grants to various regions, prioritizing women, children, youth, indigenous people, and African descendants. They also supported doctoral students conducting research in Latin America and the Caribbean. Funding for the IAF was $22.45 million in FY2011 and an estimated $22.5 million in FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 request is for $18.1 million, a nearly 20% decline from FY2012 appropriations. Despite the funding cuts, the agency aims to maintain its program level by partnering with other U.S. government agencies and the private sector. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) received $22.5 million in foreign assistance funding in FY2011, with additional funding from the Social Progress Trust Fund (SPTF) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) providing economic assistance to developing nations. SPTF funding for IAF will decrease in future years, while MCC uses a competitive selection process for aid distribution. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) awards compacts and threshold programs to countries, with a focus on measurable impact and assisting countries in weak performance areas. Several Latin American and Caribbean countries have received assistance, totaling $886.7 million. For example, El Salvador signed a $461 million compact in 2006 to develop its northern border region, focusing on infrastructure, human development, and productive development projects. El Salvador and Honduras received assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for development projects. El Salvador's $461 million compact focused on infrastructure, human development, and productive development. Honduras signed a $215 million compact for rural development and transportation projects. MCC terminated $10 million in funding for Honduras due to political issues. Honduras completed its compact in 2010, but MCC decided not to renew it due to corruption concerns. Honduras was declared eligible for a $20 million threshold program by the MCC to address corruption and economic growth barriers. Nicaragua had a $175 million compact focusing on infrastructure and rural development projects, but $61.5 million in funding was suspended and terminated after disputed elections. Guyana also received a $6.7 million threshold program from the MCC in 2007. The MCC implemented programs in Paraguay and Peru to address corruption and improve fiscal policies. Paraguay received $34.6 million in 2006 and $30.3 million in 2009 for reducing corruption and strengthening institutions. Peru signed a $35.6 million program in 2009 to increase immunization rates and combat corruption. The Peace Corps has had almost 65,000 volunteers in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1961, with 2,600 volunteers in 22 countries working on development projects. The Peace Corps in Latin America and the Caribbean received funding of $65 million in FY2011, decreasing to $61 million in FY2012 and an estimated $60 million for FY2013. The number of volunteers in the region is expected to decline to 1,800 by the end of FY2013. Programs in Colombia are expanding, but operations in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname are set to close due to budget cuts. Security concerns have led to the suspension of operations in some countries, such as Haiti in 2005. The Peace Corps has faced security concerns in Latin America and the Caribbean, leading to the withdrawal of volunteers from Haiti in 2005 and Bolivia in 2008. In 2012, volunteers were pulled out of Honduras due to high levels of violence. Programs in El Salvador and Guatemala were also affected, with volunteer training classes cancelled in 2011. Despite these challenges, the Peace Corps plans to send new volunteers to El Salvador and Guatemala in 2013. The State Department's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean make up 45% of the total budget. The request also prioritizes assistance for Haiti to support earthquake recovery and development efforts. The FY2013 request for aid to Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on different program areas: \"Peace and Security\" (30%), \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" (24%), \"Investing in People\" (23%), and \"Economic Growth\" (20%). The request is 10% less than FY2012 and takes advantage of favorable development trends in the region. Mark Feierstein is capitalizing on positive development trends in the region, with sound economic management and increased access to education reducing poverty and income inequality. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage Guyana programs from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made. Some Members are concerned about a 10% decrease in funding for Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly in citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts. Some Members have concerns about declines in assistance for programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. There is consensus on providing assistance for Haiti's recovery, but some Members want transparency and accountability in the aid program. Opposition exists towards parts of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding, such as the Global Climate Change Initiative and increased funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Additionally, some Members oppose cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, which they believe are crucial for democracy advocates. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations, potentially reducing foreign aid funding by 11.8% and 4.7% from the Administration's request. Specific metrics are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of assistance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Members of Congress should examine if the FY2013 request aligns with U.S. interests and objectives in the region. The potential impact of proposed FY2013 aid cuts for Latin America on U.S. policy and bilateral relations is a key concern. Resource coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors is crucial to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. Fragmentation among different agencies managing aid programs in the region has led to a lack of awareness and potential overlap in assistance efforts. Coordination efforts are needed to avoid duplication and ensure efficient use of resources. The lack of coordination among U.S. agencies and international donors providing assistance in Latin America may lead to unnecessary overlap and inefficiencies. With better coordination, efforts can be complementary, increasing the impact of programs. Congress should consider closer coordination with other donors to maximize the effectiveness of aid. Efforts in Latin America by U.S. agencies and international donors lack coordination, leading to inefficiencies and duplication. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts, focus on specific countries or sectors, and use limited funds more efficiently. However, challenges exist in determining leadership and division of labor. Strategic objectives may conflict with development goals, but trilateral cooperation agreements with successful countries in the region aim to provide new solutions and expertise for aid programs. The Administration requested assistance for Brazil in FY2013 to strengthen the government's development agency and implement agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in third countries. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement challenges. Providing assistance through foreign governments raises oversight concerns and could potentially lead to misuse of U.S. funds. Critics argue that supporting emerging donors could build capacities for regional stability and development. Some questions Congress may consider include: identifying agencies with comparative advantages in providing assistance, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies in foreign aid, promoting inter-agency coordination, assessing U.S. comparative advantages in assistance programs, exploring support from other donors for less strategic countries or sectors, evaluating the impact of building foreign assistance capacities of regional partners on U.S. interests, ensuring proper use of U.S. funds by partner nations, and examining political will and program sustainability in Latin American and Caribbean nations. The United States should assess host nations' political will to implement necessary reforms for effective use of U.S. assistance. Without willingness to sustain programs, aid impact will be limited. Latin American and Caribbean nations vary in political will and program sustainability. Colombia, a major recipient of U.S. aid, has shown success in reform implementation. USAID is transitioning out of Panama and reducing family planning programs in other countries as partners take over funding and management. Despite successes, challenges remain according to GAO reports. Numerous GAO reports over the past decade indicate that political will has often been lacking in Latin American and Caribbean nations to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. U.S.-funded programs have faced challenges in sustainability, such as lack of resources for training, equipment, and maintenance. Even MCC-funded projects have encountered issues with program sustainability, as seen in a study of the MCC compact in Honduras. Members of Congress need to consider the political will and sustainability of foreign aid programs in the region. Members of Congress considering foreign aid appropriations for Latin American and Caribbean countries should assess the host country's capacity to maintain provided equipment, plan for eventual financial responsibility, and demonstrate political will for necessary reforms. They should also evaluate if U.S. assistance will be complemented by host nation resources or public-private partnerships, and if it should be contingent upon reforms or financing. FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State and Foreign Operations totaled $48.3 billion, with $40.1 billion for the core budget and $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State and Foreign Operations totaled $48.3 billion, with $40.1 billion for the core budget and $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up its bill (S. 3241) totaling $52.3 billion, including $50 billion for the core budget and $2.3 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for exceeding agreed-upon cuts and potentially damaging national security. The impact on foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean was uncertain under both bills. The House and Senate reports expressed concerns about conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean and intended to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request. They emphasized the importance of supporting counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in key countries to combat drug trafficking and violent crime. The Senate report called for additional U.S. aid to address security and stability in the region. The Committee expressed concerns about the challenges in Central and South America and called for additional U.S. aid to strengthen democratic institutions, police forces, and address poverty in the region. Specific funding levels were recommended for Colombia and Mexico, with both reports suggesting assistance above the requested levels. The House report recommended additional funds for training and technical assistance, while the Senate report called for increased funding for security and stability in the region. The House and Senate reports recommended increased funding for Colombia and Mexico, with differing priorities. The House report suggested additional funds for democracy programs in Venezuela, while the Senate report supported the Administration's request for democracy programs to be administered by the National Endowment for Democracy. Additionally, the House recommended funding for CARSI at the requested level of ESF and $10 million above the request in INCLE. The House and Senate reports recommended increased funding for regional security programs in Colombia and Mexico, with differing priorities. The House suggested additional funds for democracy programs in Venezuela, while the Senate supported the Administration's request for democracy programs. The Senate report recommended funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon, while the House report made no reference to such programs. Ultimately, Congress took no action on the appropriations bills and enacted a six-month continuing resolution. In 2013, Congress approved legislation (P.L. 113-6) funding federal programs through the end of FY2013, with State Department and Foreign Operations accounts funded at the same level as FY2012, subject to budget sequestration cuts. Sequestration reduced funding by about 5%, applied at the account level, with country-level allocations for FY2013 pending."
