    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that it is in the national interest for all citizens, including active-duty service members, to be allowed to vote in Federal elections. Since 1977, active-duty service members serving overseas or on the United States mainland have been excluded from fully participating and voting in both general and runoff Federal elections in American Samoa due to various factors. American Samoa law requiring uniformed service voters to register in person is contrary to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Despite being in effect for over 15 years, American Samoa has not addressed this discrepancy between Federal and territorial law. It is necessary to ensure that the votes of uniformed voters are counted in Federal elections in American Samoa and that active duty service members do not need to register in person. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act supersedes American Samoa law, and the election of Members of the United States House of Representatives should ideally occur in the first week of November in even-numbered years. There have been unresolved Delegate election outcomes in American Samoa since 1980, leading to run-off elections. When a Delegate election in American Samoa goes to a runoff, the final outcome is not known until late November. This delay can result in the newly elected Delegate having a lower seniority compared to other Members of Congress. Holding a primary election when more than 2 candidates run for Delegate can increase the chances of the general election producing a candidate with a majority of votes. Primary election required for Delegate election in American Samoa to ensure timely outcome and increase chances of general election producing a candidate with a majority of votes. Amendment to the Act requires a primary election in American Samoa if 3 or more candidates file for the office of Delegate by July. The candidate with over 50% of the votes in the primary election will be the sole candidate in the general election, otherwise, the top 2 candidates will proceed to the general election. Candidates for the office of Delegate to the United States House of Representatives must file their candidacy by the first Tuesday of July each year for the general election. Amendments to the Act regarding the Territory of American Samoa's representation in the United States House of Representatives will take effect on January 1, 2003."
