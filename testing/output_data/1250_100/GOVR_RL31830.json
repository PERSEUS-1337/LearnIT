    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. IDEA has been amended multiple times, most recently by the 1997 IDEA reauthorization. Congress is currently examining IDEA with H.R. 1350, which passed the House in 2003. This report will discuss the major changes proposed by H.R. 1350. H.R. 1350, if enacted, would make changes to current law regarding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The bill passed by the House in 2003, with some issues not included in the final version. Changes include an amendment to the definition of FAPE, while other definitions remain largely unchanged. The amendment in H.R. 1350 aims to align IDEA with the requirements for highly qualified teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act. It also includes a new provision for FAPE that is in line with the Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley. Additionally, a new definition of \"highly qualified\" is added, and discussions on children with disabilities definitions were held during the House debate. H.R. 1350 aligns IDEA with No Child Left Behind Act for highly qualified teachers and includes provisions for FAPE. It also introduces a new definition of \"highly qualified\" and addresses issues related to children with disabilities definitions. The bill makes minimal changes to IDEA state and substate grant formulas without altering fund allocation. H.R. 1350 would limit the number of children with disabilities counted for state grants to 13.5% of all children ages 3 to 17. This change aims to prevent states from over-identifying children to increase grants. The bill specifies authorized amounts for Part B appropriations, increasing annually until FY2010, then returning to \"such sums\" for subsequent years. H.R. 1350 maintains permanent authorization of Part B grants to states, with changes in state reserves for administration and other activities. States can reserve a minimum of about $570,000 or 20% for state administration. The bill aims to limit the number of children with disabilities counted for grants and specifies authorized amounts for Part B appropriations. H.R. 1350 would set limits on state reserves for state-level activities and increase the state minimum for administration to $750,000. States can use up to 40% of the reserved amount for assisting local educational agencies with high-cost special education services. The Supreme Court case Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. highlighted the issue of providing extensive services to children with disabilities at school. Current law specifies permitted uses for state reserves for activities related to children with disabilities, and H.R. 1350 proposes additional uses such as voluntary binding arbitration and a prereferral educational support system. States would be required to adhere to these new provisions. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to the language of section 612(a) of IDEA, allowing states to \"reasonably demonstrate to\" instead of \"demonstrate to the satisfaction of\" the Secretary. This change aims to address concerns about the Department of Education overemphasizing compliance with process. H.R. 1350 would modify state eligibility requirements to align with the No Child Left Behind Act and amend state personnel standards to meet NCLBA requirements. The change in language aims to focus on overall compliance with the Act without forcing states to change individual words or phrases unless there is a clear contradiction. H.R. 1350 would modify state eligibility requirements to align with the No Child Left Behind Act, including provisions for children with disabilities in private schools. States would have to meet performance goals for children with disabilities based on the State's definition of adequate yearly progress. The IDEA currently requires public agencies to cover costs for children with disabilities placed in private schools. Reimbursement may be required if FAPE was not provided in a timely manner. Limitations on reimbursement exist, but exceptions apply for situations like parental illiteracy or harm to the child. H.R. 1350 clarifies the proportional amount of IDEA funds for special education services for children in private schools. It includes provisions for child find, consultation, right to appeal, and reimbursement for private school placement. The bill also ensures timely completion of the child find process for children in private schools. H.R. 1350 ensures timely completion of child find process for children in private schools. It includes provisions for consultation, right to appeal, and reimbursement for private school placement. Private school officials have the right to complain if consultation is not meaningful or timely. Reimbursement cannot be reduced if parents were prevented from providing notice or if compliance would harm the child. H.R. 1350 would make changes to local educational agency eligibility, allowing funds to be used for high-cost special education services. It also maintains financial requirements such as supplementing special education funding and maintaining effort levels. LEAs can count up to 20% of increased IDEA grants towards meeting funding requirements. H.R. 1350 would modify state oversight of IDEA funds, requiring the SEA to prohibit a LEA from using funds if they are unable to provide appropriate education programs. It also allows funds to be used for additional expenses and services to align with the No Child Left Behind Act. H.R. 1350 allows LEAs to use up to 15% of their Part B grant for prereferral services for students needing academic and behavioral support. It also amends provisions related to evaluations, assessments, and IEPs, and introduces a new section on determining specific learning disabilities. H.R. 1350 expands LEA flexibility in conducting evaluations for children with specific learning disabilities, even without parental consent. It also streamlines IEP requirements to reduce paperwork for teachers and schools. The House bill H.R. 1350 aims to reduce paperwork for teachers and schools by discontinuing the requirement for benchmarks and short term objectives in IEPs starting in 2005-2006. It also allows for limited participation of regular education teachers in IEP meetings, joint excuse of team members, development of multi-year IEPs, and alternative meeting methods like video conferences. These changes are intended to streamline the process while ensuring the provision of FAPE under IDEA. H.R. 1350 aims to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents of children with disabilities and schools by making significant changes to procedural safeguards. It adds a statute of limitations for presenting complaints and modifies the requirements for prior written notice. The bill also eliminates the need to provide a copy of procedural safeguards to parents on each notification of an IEP meeting. H.R. 1350 introduces changes to procedural safeguards for parents of children with disabilities, including providing a copy of the safeguards notice upon referral, annually, and upon request. It also includes new provisions for voluntary binding arbitration and resolution sessions, expanding mediation procedures to cover disputes prior to complaint filing. The state educational agency must ensure procedures for resolving disputes through voluntary binding arbitration, agreed to in writing by both parties and conducted by an impartial arbitrator. This process is final unless there is fraud or misconduct. The arbitration must be scheduled promptly and held at a convenient location. The parents have the right to a due process hearing with the opportunity for appeal, where they can be accompanied by counsel and present evidence. The decision made in the hearing is final, but parties can appeal and bring a civil action. H.R. 1350 proposes significant changes to IDEA due process procedures, allowing either parents or the LEA to request a hearing conducted by the SEA. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to IDEA due process procedures, allowing the SEA to conduct the hearing. It introduces a \"resolution session\" where parents and professionals discuss complaints before a due process hearing. If the complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the hearing will proceed without certain procedural safeguards. H.R. 1350 introduces changes to IDEA due process procedures, including a \"resolution session\" for discussing complaints before a hearing. Parents cannot raise new issues at the hearing unless previously discussed. An amendment shifts the determination of attorneys' fees to the Governor or state official instead of the court. Fees are based on community rates with specific prohibitions and limitations. Attorneys' fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer to parents, unless the relief obtained is not more favorable. Fees are also not awarded for IEP team meetings unless convened due to administrative or judicial actions. Fees can be awarded to parents if they were justified in rejecting a settlement offer, but may be reduced if the parent unreasonably prolonged the resolution, fees exceed community rates, services were excessive, or time spent was unreasonable. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to attorneys' fees awarded in special education cases, specifying rates determined by the Governor of the State. It also addresses how children with disabilities violating disciplinary rules are treated under current law. Children with disabilities who violate disciplinary rules are subject to various options by school personnel, including suspension for up to ten days, placement in an interim alternative education setting for up to forty-five days for serious situations, and a manifestation determination review to assess the link between the disability and misbehavior. If behavior is not linked to the disability, expulsion may occur but educational services must continue. H.R. 1350 would maintain the ability to suspend for ten days but remove other provisions. H.R. 1350 would allow school personnel to change the placement of a child with a disability for up to 45 school days for violating student conduct, with consideration of unique circumstances. It may extend beyond 45 days if required by state law for safety and educational atmosphere. The bill removes the requirement to determine if the behavior is a manifestation of the disability. H.R. 1350 proposes disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, allowing for the application of standard procedures with the continuation of educational services. It also includes provisions for professional development on behavioral supports for school administrators and requires states to provide data on disciplinary actions by race, ethnicity, and disability category. H.R. 1350 addresses disproportionality in disciplinary actions, emphasizing the importance of safe and drug-free schools for children with disabilities. It includes amendments regarding students with behavioral problems and proposes changes to section 616, which involves withholding funding for non-compliance with special education provisions. H.R. 1350 includes new monitoring and enforcement provisions for improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities. The Secretary would monitor state indicators like academic achievement and graduation rates, taking actions if progress is unsatisfactory. H.R. 1350 introduces monitoring and enforcement measures to improve educational outcomes for children with disabilities. The Secretary can take various actions, such as providing technical assistance, withholding funds, and imposing special conditions on states not in compliance with the law. Amendments include a pilot program on paperwork reduction and granting waivers for paperwork requirements to selected states. H.R. 1350 introduces measures to reduce paperwork and non-instructional time for addressing statutory and regulatory requirements. It also includes provisions for monitoring and enforcing compliance with educational outcomes for children with disabilities, such as providing technical assistance and granting waivers for paperwork requirements to selected states. Additionally, the bill makes modest changes to services for preschool children and infants with disabilities. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to Part D of the law, including re-arranging language and adding new findings. It focuses on professional development activities for special education personnel, requiring at least 90% of grants to be used for this purpose. The bill also continues other provisions of Part D without change, such as authorizing grants for Community. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to Part D of the law, including establishing a National Center for Special Education Research. It also requires the General Accounting Office to conduct reports on IDEA and special education, focusing on reducing paperwork, defining children with disabilities, and exploring distance learning for professional development programs. The curr_chunk discusses approaches for delivering professional development programs for special education personnel, a study on limited English proficient students under IDEA, and a study on state costs for complying with IDEA requirements."
