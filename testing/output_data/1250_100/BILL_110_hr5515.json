    "content": "Section 233(e) of the Act is amended to specify the process for agreements to enter into force, including the delivery of documents to Congress. The Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration determines if an agreement will impact the actuarial balance of the social security system over a 75-year period. The agreement must result in a net reduction of at least 0.005 percent of the present value of taxable payroll for the period. The terms 'actuarial balance', 'taxable payroll', and 'adjusted summarized income rate' are defined for clarity. The \"adjusted summarized income rate\" and \"adjusted summarized cost rate\" are defined as percentages over a period, based on the trust fund balance, income from taxes, cost, and targeted trust fund balance. The trust fund balance refers to the combined balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. \"Income from taxes\" is the amounts deposited in the Trust Funds as appropriations during a period. During a period, the term 'cost' refers to disbursements from the Trust Funds, including benefit payments, administrative expenses, and transfers to the Railroad Retirement program. The 'target trust fund balance' is the balance at the end of a 75-year period. The Chief Actuary determines the trust fund balance needed to support a 100 percent OASDI trust fund ratio for the year following a 75-year period. The agreement under this section will not take effect if a disapproving bill is enacted within 60 days. If the Chief Actuary predicts a net reduction in the actuarial balance of the social security system, the agreement may be affected. The security system established by this title must be equal to at least 0.005 percent of the present value of taxable payroll for the agreement to enter into force. The provisions of paragraph (6)(A) are enacted by Congress as part of the rules for disapproval and approval resolutions, superseding other rules if inconsistent. During a 60-day period, Congress can consider a bill for approval or disapproval of an agreement under certain rules. The agreement cannot be amended after being transmitted to Congress. This amendment applies to totalization arrangements under the Social Security Act transmitted after the enactment of the Act. The enactment of this Act affects totalization arrangements between the US and other countries, signed before the Act's enactment date. These agreements will not enter into force until after the Act's enactment date, following specific rules outlined in the Social Security Act. The President must submit a report to Congress supporting totalization agreements as required by the amended section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act. Additionally, biennial reports on the ongoing operation of totalization agreements must be provided to Congress. \"Biennial Oversight Reports on totalization agreements must be submitted to Congress as required by the Social Security Act.\" The Commissioner of Social Security must submit biennial reports to Congress evaluating the operation of totalization agreements. Reports include information on benefit costs, contributions, fraudulent receipt of benefits, and integrity of data from other countries. The Commissioner of Social Security must submit biennial reports to Congress evaluating totalization agreements, including data integrity, demographic trends, and cost estimates deviations. The initial report is due by December 31, 2008. SEC. 203. Suspension of benefits for individuals removed from the United States amends the Social Security Act to restrict benefits and lump sum death payments for individuals removed from the country. These amendments apply to individuals notified of their removal after the twelfth month following the enactment of the Act."
