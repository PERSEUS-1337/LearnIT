    "content": "Designation of military installations and certain communities as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas. Designation of military installations selected for closure or realignment as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary of Commerce respectively. The designated zones and areas include the local communities within the jurisdiction of the military installations. The designations of military installations as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas must be made within 60 days of being recommended for closure or realignment. Enterprise zones designated under this provision are in addition to the 100 zones authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 allows for the funding of economic adjustment assistance or community planning assistance in enterprise zones designated for military installation closure or realignment. The designation of a military installation as a redevelopment area remains valid for 5 years, with annual reviews conducted by the Secretary of Commerce. The \"base closure law\" is defined within this context. The term \"base closure law\" refers to specific legislation including the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act. \"Substantial realignment\" is defined as a significant reduction in military installation operations resulting in 50% or more of personnel being reassigned to another installation. Priority is given to commercial use of property on military installations designated as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas. The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is amended to restrict the use of buildings on military installations designated as enterprise zones or redevelopment areas for homeless assistance until they are no longer considered for commercial or redevelopment uses."
