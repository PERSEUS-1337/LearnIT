    "content": "Prior to 1988, Medicaid did not cover services in a child's IEP/IFSP as special education funds were used. Congress changed the financing relationship between IDEA and Medicaid in 1988. IDEA requires interagency agreements to ensure services for eligible students, with Medicaid considered the first payer. The 1988 law allows but does not require this according to CMS officials. The 1988 law allows state Medicaid agencies to pay for services in an IEP/IFSP, but it is not mandatory. Most states do pay for these services, but concerns have been raised about improper Medicaid payments for school-based services. The U.S. General Accounting Office identified three main concerns regarding billing practices and oversight of Medicaid school-based services. Improper payments in Medicaid school-based services were found in at least 2 of 17 states due to uneven oversight by HCFA. Bundled billing methods used by seven states lacked documentation and failed to account for variations in service needs. Some school districts received little reimbursement as state agencies and private contractors retained significant portions of federal payments, with some retaining 50% to 85% of reimbursements. Schools received minimal reimbursement for services provided to Medicaid-eligible children. Four conditions must be met for LEAs to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement for IDEA-related services. Manuals were issued to assist schools in obtaining reimbursement, with input from the education community. In FY2006, nationwide Medicaid expenditures for school-based services totaled $2.7 billion, with $1.9 billion (69%) for benefits and $849 million (31%) for administration/training. Spending patterns varied across states, with some reporting expenditures for benefits only and others for administration/training only. The Bush Administration highlighted concerns about abuse and overpayments in school-based Medicaid claims, leading to reviews by the HHS OIG in 22 states. The HHS OIG and GAO have found inappropriate Medicaid billing in transportation services and administrative functions for school districts. Examples include lack of verification for services provided, inaccurate time studies for cost allocation, and payments for personnel not involved in Medicaid activities. The Bush Administration published a final rule in 2007 restricting federal payments for school-based administrative activities and transportation services under Medicaid, aiming to reduce federal outlays by billions over the years. This rule was estimated to result in a loss of roughly $3.2 billion over five years in 34 affected states. The Bush Administration's 2007 rule aimed to restrict federal payments for school-based administrative activities and transportation services under Medicaid, potentially resulting in a loss of $3.2 billion over five years in 34 affected states. Many oppose the cuts, arguing they will reduce access to needed healthcare for children and are inconsistent with approved state plan amendments allowing federal funding for these services. The final rule eliminates federal matching funds for certain school-based spending under Medicaid, but states can still claim federal dollars for school-based administrative activities conducted by state or local Medicaid agency employees with proper oversight. Federal funding remains available for administrative overhead costs integral to direct medical services. The final rule eliminates federal matching funds for certain school-based spending under Medicaid, but states can still claim federal dollars for school-based administrative activities conducted by state or local Medicaid agency employees with proper oversight. Medicaid outreach, eligibility intake, and transportation of children for direct medical services are reimbursable under approved state Medicaid plans. The moratorium on the school-based rule under H.R. 2642 was extended to April 1, 2009, and then further extended to July 1, 2009, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The cost of the moratorium on this rule, along with two other final rules, is estimated to be $105 million in FY2009."
