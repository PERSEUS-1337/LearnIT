    "content": "The Act titled \"Long Term Care Quality Improvement Act of 2004\" aims to improve the quality of long term care in skilled nursing facilities under Medicare. The Long Term Care Quality Improvement Act of 2004 includes provisions for detailed reporting of nursing expenditures and the development of new quality measures in skilled nursing facilities under Medicare. The Secretary will develop quality measures for use in a payment system under the Long Term Care Quality Improvement Act of 2004. These measures will include process, structural, and outcome measures that are valid, reliable, and structured to minimize provider burden. The Secretary will develop quality measures for the payment system under the Long Term Care Quality Improvement Act of 2004, including measures on nursing home staffing levels and special provisions for small facilities. The new quality performance measures will be posted on the Secretary's website, and payment rates will be adjusted based on quality performance. The payment rates under subsection (e) must not be lower than the RUG rates effective as of October 1, 2004, adjusted annually. The Secretary will develop methods to link payment rates to quality in consultation with various stakeholders. Providers' payments will depend on performance on quality indicators measured under subsection (f), with special payments for facilities that enhance quality. The Secretary may test methods to enhance quality in skilled nursing facilities through pilot studies and other appropriate methods. Development and testing of quality measures and new payment methods should be completed within 54 months of the enactment of this subsection. Additionally, the Secretary will conduct a study on the adequacy of public payments and future financing options for quality nursing facility care. The Secretary will conduct a study on the adequacy of Medicaid financing for nursing facility care, Medicare's impact on Medicaid patient care, industry margins, trends affecting costs, demographic changes, and options for financing long-term care. Annual reports will be submitted to Congress until a final report is provided. The Secretary will submit a final report to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The report will include the study results on skilled nursing facilities, recommendations for changes to Medicare payment system, and an analysis of alternative approaches to address identified issues."
