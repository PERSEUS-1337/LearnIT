    "content": "The consumer data industry provides information to firms about consumer behavior in financial transactions. This data is used by lenders, banks, credit unions, insurance companies, payday lenders, and merchants to make decisions on loans, accounts, insurance products, and setting policy premiums. Consumer data is crucial for firms to assess the risk of financial transactions with consumers. Negative information like overdrafts, account closures, and fraud incidents can limit access to credit for consumers. Correcting inaccurate data on consumer reports can be challenging. Consumers may find correcting consumer data reports time-consuming and complex. Exclusion of positive information like timely repayments can limit credit access. The report covers background on the consumer data industry, consumer scoring, regulatory framework, and policy issues on inaccurate data, negative information duration, billing practices, and consumer rights. In the 116th Congress, credit reporting and consumer data industry are topics of interest. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the consumer data industry, addressing legislative and regulatory developments. Chairwoman Maxine Waters released draft bills to address policy issues related to credit reporting. The consumer data industry, including credit reporting agencies like Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, provide credit reports based on individuals' financial history. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates this industry, ensuring consumer reports do not include sensitive information like race or medical history. Specialty credit reporting agencies collect data on payment for phone, utilities, and telecommunication services to verify customer identities. Some CRAs specialize in rent payment data for tenant screening, debt collection, and fraud verification. Furnishers voluntarily submit tradelines to CRAs, serving as records of transaction activity. Furnishers have different reporting practices when submitting tradelines to credit reporting agencies (CRAs), with varying criteria such as reporting unpaid customer obligations, minimum threshold levels, principal balances, or all monies owed. Becoming furnishers involves approval and compliance with CRA policies, including data transfer security risks and standardized reporting formats. Compliance with industry data transfer requirements is necessary for CRAs to accept data, requiring investment in compatible technology. Compliance costs may deter smaller firms from becoming furnishers due to legal obligations under the FCRA, including reporting accurate information and investigating consumer disputes. Different CRAs have varying reporting conventions, leading to potential discrepancies in consumer reports. Consumer credit scores are numeric metrics used to predict financial behaviors. Consumer credit scores are used to predict various financial behaviors, such as loan default likelihood or insurance claim filing. Consumer scores are computed using information from consumer reports, with some firms specializing in producing these scores. Different scoring firms may calculate scores differently for the same individual and behavior, as they purchase consumer information from different CRAs with varying policies. Consumer credit scores are determined by scoring firms with proprietary statistical models and weighting algorithms. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the industry, requiring consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable procedures for providing consumer information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) establishes consumers' rights regarding their credit reports and imposes responsibilities on those who collect, furnish, and use the information. It includes consumer protection provisions such as free disclosure of information after adverse actions, the right to one free credit report annually, and the ability to dispute inaccurate information. The FCRA also sets a timeframe for correcting errors in credit reports. The FCRA limits the time negative information can stay on credit reports, with collection tradelines lasting 7 years and bankruptcy tradelines lasting 10 years. The CFPB oversees CRAs, conducting examinations and enforcing consumer protection laws. In 2017, the CFPB released a report on its supervisory work in the credit reporting system. The CFPB released a report on its supervisory work in the credit reporting system, focusing on improving data accuracy, dispute handling, and furnisher reporting. Efforts include developing data governance programs and improving dispute resolution processes. Congress has also enacted new consumer protections, such as the right to a free credit freeze to prevent fraud and identity theft. The accuracy of consumer information in credit reports is a key policy concern, as inaccuracies can limit access to credit or increase costs. The FTC found that 26% of participants identified errors in their credit reports, with corrections leading to score increases for 13% of participants. This could result in better credit terms for consumers. The accuracy of consumer credit reporting is crucial for offering better credit terms. Inaccuracies can arise from various sources, such as consumer errors or furnishers inputting incorrect data. Matching information to the right individual can be challenging, especially in cases of similar names or identity theft. To enhance predictive power, consumer tradelines need to be regularly updated with accurate information. The CFPB has urged credit bureaus and financial firms to improve data accuracy, requiring standardized accuracy reports since 2014. These reports detail consumer dispute frequencies and identify furnishers with the most disputes. According to the CFPB, the top 100 furnishers provide 76% of tradeline information to the largest nationwide CRAs, and the furnishers regularly update the account status of reported tradelines. The larger CRAs have also made improvements to the communication tool for dispute resolution. Effective July 1, 2017, CRAs enhanced public record data standards for civil judgments and tax liens. The accuracy of credit reports depends on consumers monitoring and disputing any discrepancies. Chairwoman Waters' draft bill, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act of 2019, aims to address concerns around inaccurate or disputed data by establishing new consumer rights. The Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act aims to address concerns around inaccurate data by granting consumers new rights in the dispute process, including more information, the right to appeal to credit bureaus, and seeking injunctive relief. It also provides credit restoration for victims of predatory activities and considers the appropriate length of time for negative information on credit reports. Limiting consumer access to financial services can impact their cost of transactions. Consumer data reports used by employers may restrict job opportunities. Retaining negative credit information can lead to inaccurate risk assessments and costly credit options. However, it also allows lenders to observe long-term trends. The longer credit information remains on reports, the better for lenders to detect patterns in consumer behavior. Premature removal of negative information may lead to unreliable scores, prompting stricter lending policies. This could limit credit access and competition, favoring lenders with more consumer data. Early removal of negative credit data may hinder fraud detection, especially for small businesses and nonprofits. The CCRRA aims to shorten the time adverse information stays on credit reports by three years, allowing for more accurate credit scoring. Inconsistent reporting practices by different debt holders lead to variations in when unpaid debts appear on consumer reports. Debt buyers may acquire medical debt after 30 or 60 days, leading to collections and negative information on credit reports. The CFPB found that 33% of credit reports had collection tradelines, with 52% related to medical collections. Other significant tradelines included unclassified debts (17.3%), cable/cellular bills (8.2%), utilities (7.3%), and retail stores (7.2%). More than half of collection tradelines were for medical debt, with amounts owed mostly under $1,000. The median amount owed for medical collection tradelines was $207, and 75% were under $490. Consumers often dispute medical debt due to inconsistent billing practices and lack of cost transparency. Regulators and industry have taken steps to reduce medical tradelines' negative impact on credit reports. The IRS rule requires tax-exempt hospitals to determine patient eligibility for financial assistance before taking collection actions. Nonprofit hospitals must give patients 120 days to pay before collections. Credit reporting agencies now have a 180-day waiting period for medical collections on credit reports. P.L. 115-174 amends the FCRA to protect veterans from certain medical debt on their credit reports. The CCRRA imposes restrictions on medical collections on credit reports for veterans, including a 180-day rule. It also requires expedited removal of fully repaid or settled debts, including medical collections. Consumers face challenges advocating for themselves with credit reporting issues due to lack of awareness of their rights. The CFPB receives numerous credit reporting complaints and provides financial education resources on its website. The CCRRA proposes free credit scores and reports for consumers, along with more information on dispute rights and extended time for hard inquiries. Policy questions remain regarding these proposals. Policy questions exist regarding the use of credit bureau data for purposes such as employment decisions. Employers use credit background checks to reduce theft and legal liability. Compliance with the FCRA requires informing applicants and obtaining permission for credit reports. The debate continues on whether using credit information in hiring decisions unfairly impacts job applicants. The CCRRA would ban the use of credit information for employment decisions, unless required by law or for a national security investigation. The CFPB estimates that credit scores cannot be generated for approximately 20% of the U.S. population due to their limited credit histories, with some consumers being credit invisibles and others being non-scorable. Nonscorable consumers, comprising over 9 million individuals, represent 8.3% of the U.S. adult population. Younger adults may be credit invisible due to insufficient credit history, while older adults may face issues with stale credit records. Credit scoring models vary, and consumers may still be scored by some models even if they are nonscorable by others. Borrowers with impaired credit histories can improve their credit scores with credit building loans. Secured credit cards and alternative credit scores can help credit invisible consumers build or repair their credit histories. These options provide lenders with more information to determine financial relationships with previously nonscoreable individuals. Alternative credit scoring models may increase accuracy by including additional predictive consumer payment activity beyond traditional credit reports. Including new information in credit scores, such as utility and rent payments, could benefit individuals with limited credit histories. However, the reliability of medical debt tradelines as predictors of creditworthiness is questioned due to uneven reporting and lack of consumer choice in incurring such debt. Some newer credit scoring models apply less weight to medical debt. Developing credit scores with alternative information may help lenders identify new creditworthy consumers. Regulators and Congress have explored the potential for alternative credit scoring. Freddie Mac and other government-sponsored enterprises are considering using updated credit scoring models in mortgage underwriting. The CCRRA may direct the CFPB to report on the impact of nontraditional data on credit scoring. Implementing newer credit scoring models in the mortgage market may be slow due to the high cost of upgrading automated underwriting systems. Credit scores are just one factor in the underwriting process, with other variables like debt-to-income ratio also considered. The use of alternative credit scores in mortgage underwriting may help some borrowers near a threshold, but may not significantly change credit access overall. Congressional interest in data protection has increased after the Equifax cybersecurity breach. CRAs must comply with data protection requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The CFPB lacks authority to regulate safeguarding customer records, with the FTC enforcing Section 501(b) for nonbank financial institutions like CRAs. Bills in Congress aim to enhance standards for protecting consumer information, while a 2019 GAO report suggested actions to strengthen oversight of credit bureaus' data security. The CCRRA would expand protections for identity theft victims, including free credit monitoring and identity theft services. It would require the CFPB to create new regulations defining the parameters for these benefits."
