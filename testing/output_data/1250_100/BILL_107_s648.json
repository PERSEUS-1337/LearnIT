This section of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include signing bonuses for teachers in math and science. The Secretary awards grants to State educational agencies to provide signing bonuses to math or science teachers in high-need areas for a 4-year period. State agencies must submit criteria for bonus awards, requiring teachers to have proper licensing and academic qualifications. To receive a grant under this section, a State educational agency must establish a peer review board to review criteria for signing bonuses. The agency must also submit an application to the Secretary. The State agency will use the grant funds to award bonuses to local educational agencies for math or science teachers in high-need areas. The local educational agency must use grant funds to provide a $5,000 signing bonus annually for hiring eligible math or science teachers in middle or secondary schools. To receive the grant, the agency must submit an application to the State educational agency. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. A 'high-need area' is defined as an area where at least 30% of children are eligible under a specific section and where middle and secondary schools have a higher percentage of uncertified or unlicensed math and science teachers compared to the state average. \"SEC. 2402. Mastery bonuses for teachers in math and science.\" The Secretary awards grants to State educational agencies to assist in providing mastery bonuses to middle or secondary school math or science teachers who pass an advanced competency exam approved by the National Academy of Sciences. Teachers must agree to teach for a 5-year period after passing the exam. State educational agencies must submit criteria for awarding bonuses, including requiring teachers to have obtained licensing or certification to teach. To receive grants under this section, State educational agencies must establish a peer review board to review criteria for providing mastery bonuses. They must also submit an application to the Secretary. The funds from these grants are used to award mastery bonuses to local educational agencies for middle or secondary school math or science teachers who pass an advanced competency exam. Teachers must commit to teaching for a 5-year period after passing the exam. Local educational agencies receiving grants must use the funds to provide additional compensation to math or science teachers who pass an advanced competency exam. The teachers can receive $4,000 each year for teaching during a 5-year period or $5,000 each year for teaching in a high-need area. To apply for the grant, the local educational agency must submit an application to the State educational agency with required information. The educational agency may require authorization of appropriations totaling $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. The Mentor Teacher Program under Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act aims to help local educational agencies establish mentor teacher programs for experienced teachers to support and train novice teachers. The Mentor Teacher Program under Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act defines key terms such as \"board certified,\" \"mentor teacher,\" and \"novice teacher.\" \"Board certified\" refers to meeting National Board for Professional Teaching Standards requirements, \"mentor teacher\" is an experienced teacher who has demonstrated mastery, and \"novice teacher\" is a teacher with less than 3 years of experience in math or science. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible local educational agencies for mentor teacher programs. Grants are awarded for up to 5 years, and agencies must have received a grant for signing bonuses to be eligible. The grants aim to support mentor teacher programs in schools with teachers who have received signing bonuses. The distribution of grants prioritizes agencies with higher percentages of novice teachers. The grants awarded to local educational agencies prioritize those with higher percentages of novice teachers. The amount of each grant is determined by the total appropriation for the fiscal year and the concentration of novice teachers in the school district. Authorized activities include using funds for mentor teacher services and program development. The mentor teacher program provides training to novice teachers on effective teaching techniques through observation, instruction, coaching, and mentoring. The Federal share of the cost is 75 percent, with the non-Federal share possibly provided from State sources. Funds allocated should supplement, not supplant, other public funds for eligible individuals. The local educational agency must submit an application for a grant under section 2503 to the Secretary, accompanied by required information. Grant payments are made annually, with a limit of 2 percent for administrative costs. Failure to meet performance objectives may result in denial of grant payment. The Secretary must report program activities to relevant committees. Matching requirements are also outlined. The local educational agency must agree to provide 25 percent in non-Federal contributions for grant activities. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2006."
