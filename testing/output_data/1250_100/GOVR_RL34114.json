    "content": "Congress's contempt power is used to respond to acts that obstruct the legislative process, such as a witness refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. There are three formal methods Congress can use to combat noncompliance: inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and civil enforcement. The criminal contempt statute allows Congress to certify a contempt citation for prosecution. Criminal contempt punishes noncompliance with a subpoena but may not lead to future compliance. Congress can also seek civil enforcement through the judicial branch to ensure compliance with subpoenas, especially for executive branch officials. This report explores Congress's contempt power and the procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement of subpoenas. The power of Congress to enforce contempt actions against executive branch officials is closely tied to its investigative authority. Congress has broad authority to seek and enforce information, including confidential information, essential for its legislative function. This authority has been established by the Supreme Court through rulings on congressional oversight and investigations. For a more detailed version of this report, refer to CRS Report RL34097. The Supreme Court has established the power of Congress to enforce informational demands through two rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court emphasized the importance of inquiry for effective legislation, stating that compulsion is necessary when information is not voluntarily provided. This power has been considered essential for legislative functions since the framing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power to enforce informational demands through rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness refused to answer questions during congressional hearings and was convicted for contempt of Congress. The Court rejected the witness's argument that pending lawsuits justified withholding information, emphasizing Congress's authority to investigate. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it can require disclosures to aid its constitutional power. This power includes inquiries into the administration of existing laws and potential legislation. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's extensive investigative authority, emphasizing its power to probe waste, fraud, abuse, and maladministration within government departments. The Court recognizes Congress's ability to expose corruption and inefficiency in the Executive Branch, stating that the inherent contempt power is necessary for effective investigation and legislation. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain individuals for non-compliance, as seen in cases like Anderson v. Dunn and McGrain v. Daugherty. The individual can be imprisoned until they comply with the investigation, with the process involving the Sergeant-at-Arms bringing them before the House or Senate for trial. This power can be used for punitive or coercive purposes, as demonstrated in the case of Anderson being arrested for bribery in 1818. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain individuals for non-compliance, with the process involving the Sergeant-at-Arms bringing them before the House or Senate for trial. The individual can be granted counsel, defense witnesses, and a hearing before a resolution is passed finding them guilty of contempt. This process establishes a pattern of attachment, provision for charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, and determination of guilt. Prompt judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus may be available to review the actions of the House or Senate in contempt proceedings. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain individuals for non-compliance, with the process involving the Sergeant-at-Arms bringing them before the House or Senate for trial. Congress must provide notice and an opportunity to be heard to the contemnor, and some due process standards must be met. Inherent contempt precedents often involve incarceration, but monetary fines could be an alternative to avoid habeas corpus proceedings. Congress could argue for the imposition of fines instead of incarceration based on its inherent authority. The Supreme Court decision in Anderson questioned the extent of punishing power of deliberative assemblies for self-preservation, suggesting imprisonment as the least possible power adequate for the end proposed. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court indicated that Congress may compel testimony in certain cases, using the same means as a court of justice. The power of punishment by fine or imprisonment may be limited to ensuring testimony before either House. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is limited to ensuring testimony before either House, with the possibility of levying a fine as punishment not being a precedent. Inherent contempt proceedings do not require cooperation from other branches, allowing the House or Senate to conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender for contempt. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but imprisonment for non-compliance with a subpoena is possible until the end of the session. Inherent contempt allows Congress to imprison individuals until they comply with a subpoena, but the process is seen as outdated and ineffective. The use of inherent contempt has not been seen since 1935, and it may be more efficient if initial fact-finding and witness examination were done by a special committee before a final decision is made by the full House or Senate. Between 1795 and 1857, there were 14 inherent contempt actions initiated by Congress. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the time-consuming and cumbersome inherent contempt actions initiated by the House and Senate. This new procedure allowed for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney, rather than a trial at the bar of the chamber concerned. Despite this, most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house in the two decades following the enactment of the criminal contempt method. The statutory provisions 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194 outline the procedure for handling contempt of Congress. Section 192 states that a witness who fails to testify or produce documents can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Section 194 outlines the process for referring a witness to the courts for criminal prosecution. The House can authorize the Speaker to certify a report for prosecution in criminal contempt cases. This process is punitive and aims to deter witnesses from refusing to cooperate. Once a witness is found in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas after contempt citations have been issued may prevent further legal action. The U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt cases to grand juries is unclear, with conflicting guidance from case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, witnesses were released for not following mandatory procedures in a case involving violation of 2 U.S.C. Section 192. The U.S. Attorney is required to present contempt cases to grand juries as mandated by Congress, with no discretion allowed in the process. This requirement was highlighted in various court cases, including United States v. United States House of Representatives and Wilson v. United States. The U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt cases to grand juries is mandatory, as mandated by Congress. However, the Court of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Speaker's duty to certify contempt citations during adjournments is discretionary, based on legislative history and congressional practice. This discretion was highlighted in the case of Wilson, where convictions were reversed due to the Speaker not exercising his discretion. The U.S. Attorney's discretionary function in presenting contempt cases to grand juries contrasts with the mandatory duty mandated by Congress. Courts generally grant U.S. Attorneys broad prosecutorial discretion, even with statutes using mandatory language. Congress can seek judicial enforcement of a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement, where a court can declare noncompliance as contempt of court. The Senate has statutory authority for this, while the House can pursue civil enforcement through an authorizing resolution. In 1978, Congress enacted an alternative to inherent and criminal contempt powers. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate, giving the U.S. District Court jurisdiction over actions to enforce Senate subpoenas. The Senate can seek compliance or a declaratory judgment through a two-step process, with the court first reviewing the subpoena's validity. The Senate has discretion in choosing the enforcement method. The court's jurisdiction in enforcing a congressional subpoena is limited to the matter brought before it. If the subpoena doesn't meet legal standards, the court can't enjoin the congressional proceeding but can refuse to order compliance. Non-compliance may lead to contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially for federal government officers or employees. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to force compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers. The federal courts have jurisdiction over such claims if authorized by a house of Congress. In 2012, the House authorized a civil lawsuit to enforce subpoenas against Attorney General Eric Holder for non-compliance with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's investigation of Operation Fast and Furious. The lawsuit sought a declaratory judgment for compliance, filed in August 2012. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss in September 2013, addressing jurisdiction, standing, and separation-of-powers concerns. The court ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents and reasons for privilege. Authorization by resolution of the full House is needed for civil enforcement of subpoenas. The courts may not entertain civil motions without House authorization. DOJ acknowledged proper procedures for civil enforcement. The executive branch prefers civil enforcement for subpoenas against executive officials, not criminal contempt. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt prosecutions. This stance is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and actions in contempt proceedings against various officials. The DOJ declined to prosecute a contempt citation against an executive official invoking executive privilege. Congress may need to use civil enforcement to enforce subpoenas. In a 2014 case, the House held an IRS official in contempt for refusing to testify about targeting conservative groups. The House approved a contempt citation against Lerner for refusing to testify, but the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case. Unlike past cases involving executive privilege, Lerner's refusal was based on her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The DOJ's decision not to prosecute may set a precedent for cases not involving executive privilege. The Burford, Miers, Holder, and Lerner disputes highlight the challenges Congress faces in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials through criminal contempt. Past practice suggests that the DOJ may not prosecute noncompliance if endorsed by the President, citing prosecutorial discretion. However, in cases where the President does not endorse the official's conduct, prosecution for contempt may still be pursued. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute an official for contempt, even if the President does not endorse their actions. Congress may struggle to enforce its subpoenas through civil action, as seen in the Miers case, due to delays in obtaining a final ruling. The Miers case highlighted challenges in enforcing congressional subpoenas through civil action, leading to delays in obtaining a final ruling. Despite potential limitations in relying on the executive branch or the judicial system, Congress can still enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
