    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Independence Hall Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress finds that historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall and Independence Hall, were cared for by local government before the National Park Service took over preservation duties. However, financial constraints have hindered the government from meeting the capital needs of these sites. The Congress acknowledges the financial constraints hindering the maintenance of historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall and Independence Hall. Minting a commemorative coin is proposed to aid in funding their preservation. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue up to 1,000,000 $1 silver coins with specific specifications. The coins will depict the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, and be legal tender. The silver for the coins will be sourced from stockpiles established under a specific Act.
