The Fair Labor Standards Act now allows 16- and 17-year-old employees to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that meet safety standards. The Fair Labor Standards Act allows 16- and 17-year-old employees to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that meet safety standards, including having an on-off switch with key-lock control, being kept off when not in use, and having notices posted for employee safety. The Fair Labor Standards Act allows 16- and 17-year-old employees to operate scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that meet safety standards. Employers must report any injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving these machines to the Secretary for safety evaluation. Employers must report injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving scrap paper balers or paper box compactors to the Secretary within 10 days. Reports must include details such as names, addresses, dates of incidents, injury descriptions, and equipment information. The Secretary cannot solely rely on these reports to determine violations of child labor laws. The Secretary must investigate and inspect before determining violations of child labor laws. Reporting requirements expire 2 years after enactment. SEC. 2 amends Section 16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include section 13(c)(5) and clarifies penalties. SEC. 3 ensures that apprentices and student learners' exemption is not affected by the changes."
