    "content": "The \"Pre-K for USA Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Title IX of the Every Student Succeeds Act to include local prekindergarten development grants. The \"Pre-K for USA Act\" establishes competitive grants for high-quality prekindergarten programs, awarded by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Education for up to 3 years. Eligible local entities must provide non-Federal matching funds to receive the grant. Eligible local entities must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 20 percent of the grant amount. They can use non-Federal resources or in-kind contributions to meet this requirement. The Secretaries have the discretion to waive or reduce the matching funds for entities facing extreme financial hardship. The Secretaries may not award a grant under this section to an eligible local entity if the State has applied for or been awarded a grant under section 9212 for the same fiscal year. Definitions include 'early childhood education program' and 'eligible local entity' which encompasses various educational agencies and programs. A high-quality prekindergarten program is defined as a program supported by an eligible local entity that serves children aged 3 or 4, or children who have attained the legal age for State-funded prekindergarten. The program must meet nationally recognized standards and provide a full-day of not less than 5 hours. State-funded prekindergarten requires high staff qualifications, including teachers with a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or a related field, or those who have demonstrated knowledge through a State-approved assessment and engage in ongoing professional development for at least 2 years. The State-funded prekindergarten program requires teachers to be enrolled in a State-approved educator preparation program, have a bachelor's degree in any field with a credential in early childhood education, maintain a maximum class size of 20 children, have a child to instructional staff ratio of 10 to 1, offer a full-day program, and provide developmentally appropriate learning environments aligned with State standards. The State-funded prekindergarten program requires teachers to have salaries comparable to K-12 teaching staff, ongoing monitoring for continuous improvement, and accessible comprehensive services for children including screenings and family engagement opportunities. The State-funded prekindergarten program includes support services like parent education, family literacy, nutrition services, and programs coordinated with local educational agencies for children with disabilities. The State-funded prekindergarten program provides high-quality professional development for staff, including in-class observation and evidence-based coaching. It also meets education performance standards. The text chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for a program under the Head Start Act, including maintaining evidence-based health and safety standards. It also defines terms related to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The table of contents in the Every Student Succeeds Act is amended to include sections on State preschool development grants and Local prekindergarten development grants."
