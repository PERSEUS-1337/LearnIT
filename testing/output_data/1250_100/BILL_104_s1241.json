    "content": "The Public Broadcasting Financial Independence and Family Viewing Act of 1995 aims to ensure that programs suitable for family viewing are broadcasted throughout the day without the use of federal funds for indecent or nudity-inclusive content. It also emphasizes the importance of public broadcasting providing educational, cultural, informational, and entertaining programming for family viewing. The Commission will allow public broadcast license holders to use their spectrum for ancillary services, ensuring proceeds benefit public broadcasting and fees for non-broadcasting use are at market rates. The Commission will adopt regulations for public broadcast license holders to provide non-public broadcast programming between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. for a fee, ensuring proceeds benefit public broadcasting and maintaining their commitment to public broadcasting. Additionally, they can offer commercially sponsored programming during those hours at market rates. Enhanced underwriting is also addressed. SEC. 7. ENHANCED UNDERWRITING. Amends sections of title 47 to allow for calls to action, inducements to buy, sell, rent, or lease, and provision of price information. SEC. 8. SATELLITE, COMMON CARRIER AND OTHER FORMS OF PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION. Public Broadcasting programming can be distributed via various technologies for a fee, with proceeds benefiting public broadcasting exclusively. SEC. 9. FREQUENCY EXCHANGE. The Commission can approve frequency exchanges between public and commercial broadcasters if the proceeds benefit national public broadcasting. SEC. 10. ANCILLARY INCOME. Agreements for programming should ensure public broadcasting benefits from ancillary product sales. SEC. 11. GAO REVIEW. The General Accounting Office will review the operations of public broadcasting entities and make recommendations for improvement. They will also study the feasibility of merging public broadcasting with international broadcasting operations. SEC. 13. EDUCATIONAL RATES.
