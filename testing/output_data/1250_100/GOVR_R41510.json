    "content": "The House PAYGO rule for the 116th Congress prohibits legislation that increases the deficit or reduces the surplus over specific time periods. It applies to direct spending and revenues, with direct spending being mandatory programs like Medicare and revenues being funds collected through taxes. The House PAYGO rule applies to various types of revenues, including income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, excise taxes, duties, gifts, and miscellaneous receipts. It requires that each measure affecting direct spending and revenues must not increase the deficit over specified time periods, with provisions for offsetting any deficit increases with reductions in direct spending or increases in revenues. Under clause 10(b) of House Rule XXI, savings from a previously passed measure may be included in determining a separate measure's PAYGO compliance if a special rule combines the two measures upon engrossment. The House PAYGO rule bases deficit or surplus effects on estimates by the Committee on the Budget relative to CBO baseline estimates, consistent with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Existing law direct spending increases or revenue reductions are exempt from the House PAYGO rule. The House PAYGO rule exempts emergency provisions from deficit calculations. Legislation with an emergency designation requires a House vote for consideration. A point of order enforces the rule to prevent deficit-increasing legislation from being considered. The House PAYGO rule allows a Member to raise a point of order against legislation that increases the deficit. The rule can be waived by special rules, suspension of rules procedures, or unanimous consent. It was first established in the 110th Congress and has been modified in subsequent Congresses. The PAYGO rule was established in the 110th Congress and has been modified in subsequent Congresses. It covers both mandatory spending and revenues, with certain modifications. The rule prohibits legislation that increases the deficit and includes on-budget and off-budget entities in determining the effect on the deficit. The PAYGO rule, established in the 110th Congress, has been modified in subsequent Congresses. It requires the Budget Committee to use CBO baseline estimates and allows for exceptions to its measure-by-measure application. In the 116th Congress, the House amended the PAYGO rule to align with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, focusing on the \"on-budget deficit\" and excluding off-budget effects like those on the Social Security trust funds. This change aimed to determine if legislation increased the deficit or reduced the surplus. The House amended the PAYGO rule to align with the Statutory PAYGO Act, incorporating scoring requirements and excluding certain budgetary effects. The new Republican majority in the 112th Congress replaced the PAYGO rule with a Cut-As-You-Go (CUTGO) rule, focusing on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only. The CUTGO rule replaced the previous PAYGO rule in the 112th Congress. It focused on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending, excluding projected revenue effects. The rule did not continue the \"adjustments for current policies\" provided in the Statutory PAYGO Act, which expired in 2011. The CUTGO rule generally retained procedures from the previous PAYGO rule, such as excluding emergency requirements and requiring a vote on consideration. The new PAYGO rule was reinstated by the Democratic majority in the 116th Congress, replacing the previous CUTGO rule. It now includes off-budget effects like those impacting the Social Security trust funds. The rule retains procedures from the former rules, such as combining budgetary effects under certain circumstances and excluding emergency designations. The House PAYGO rule, along with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, aims to prevent legislative actions increasing the on-budget deficit. While similar, they differ in enforcement, with the House rule applying during legislation consideration on the House floor. The Statutory PAYGO Act only considers on-budget effects, excluding off-budget impacts like Social Security trust funds. The Statutory PAYGO Act applies the requirement to legislation after enactment, ensuring that the net effect of all bills affecting spending and revenues does not increase the deficit over a 5 or 10-year period. Unlike the House PAYGO rule, which enforces compliance during legislation consideration, the statutory rule allows for deficit-increasing legislation as long as separate bills offset the deficit increases within the same year. The statutory PAYGO rule enforces deficit reduction through sequestration, cutting budgetary resources to eliminate deficit increases from legislation. It requires balancing budgetary effects over 5 and 10-year periods, with the President taking action if deficits occur. The Statutory PAYGO Act enforces deficit reduction through sequestration, cutting budgetary resources to eliminate deficits from legislation. It requires balancing budgetary effects over 5 and 10-year periods, with the President taking action if deficits occur. The House PAYGO rule must be adopted at the beginning of each new Congress, with no expiration date specified. The Congressional Budget Office evaluates provisions of bills and amendments for budgetary impact. Emergency designations may be excluded from the evaluation, except for certain specified cases. Amendments to bills or joint resolutions are also subject to evaluation without consideration of emergency designations. The Chair shall consider provisions designated as emergencies for pay-as-you-go principles, with terms defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
