    "content": "The Act titled \"District of Columbia Court, Offender Supervision, Parole, and Public Defender Employees Equity Act of 2008\" allows retirement credit for certain employees transferred from District of Columbia service to federal service. Any individual serving as an employee or Member on or after the enactment of the Act can include qualifying District of Columbia service in calculating creditable service for specific provisions of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Qualifying service does not affect the amount of benefits payable from the Fund. Qualifying District of Columbia service includes service performed by nonjudicial employees of the District of Columbia courts or employees of entities transferred to specific government functions under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This service can be used to calculate creditable service for Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund provisions. Service performed by an individual as an employee of the District of Columbia Public Defender Service prior to 1998, for which the individual did not receive credit under specific provisions of title 5, United States Code. Service performed by an individual as an employee of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections before their coverage as a Federal Government employee, for which they did not receive credit under specific provisions of title 5, United States Code. The Office of Personnel Management will accept certification from the District of Columbia government regarding an individual's qualifying service and its duration."
