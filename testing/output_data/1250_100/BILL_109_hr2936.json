The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2005\" mandates timely provision of second opinions for participants facing imminent health threats, with a maximum 72-hour response time.

Participants are responsible for copayments for second opinions, and can choose their healthcare professional for primary care requests or specialists within the network. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2005\" mandates timely second opinions for participants. If a specialist outside the network is needed, the plan must cover the cost or negotiate fees. If no in-network provider meets standards, an outside opinion can be authorized. Travel costs are not covered by the plan. The plan or issuer must require a second opinion health professional to provide a consultation report with recommended procedures. If a request for a second opinion is denied, the participant must be informed in writing of the reasons and their right to file a grievance. Services must be obtained from participating providers unless authorized otherwise. The plan or issuer may limit referrals to its network of providers if there is a participating plan provider who meets the standard specified. Exemption applies to health care service plan contracts that provide benefits through preferred provider contracting arrangements.
