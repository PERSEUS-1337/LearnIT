    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for undocumented students by establishing Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Despite California's efforts to provide opportunities for undocumented youth, many are unaware of policies like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA. Currently, most college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. The creation of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions aims to streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540. These centers empower students, increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Various college campuses have already established such centers, offering workshops, legal clinics, and support services to enhance awareness of available resources and employment opportunities. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code to encourage the designation of Dream Resource Liaisons on California college campuses to assist students, including undocumented students, in accessing financial aid and academic opportunities. California Community Colleges and State Universities are encouraged to have staff designated as Dream Resource Liaisons knowledgeable in available resources placed in relevant campus offices. Each campus of the California State University and the University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. Dream Resource Centers may provide various support services without requiring new construction, and may be housed within existing student or academic centers. The California State University and University of California campuses are encouraged to have Dream Resource Liaisons for undocumented students. The Trustees and Regents may accept gifts to support Dream Resource Centers. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be provided if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
