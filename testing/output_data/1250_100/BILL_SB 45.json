    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 89003 of the Government Code prohibits mass mailings within 90 days before an election by or on behalf of a candidate. This new law does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating or changing penalties for crimes. The bill aims to further the Political Reform Act of 1974 by amending the Unemployment Insurance Code to emphasize the importance of a well-educated and highly skilled workforce in California's global competitiveness. It outlines principles for workforce investment programs to meet the needs of employers, workers, and students by preparing them for the global economy, increasing industry-recognized certifications and degrees, and adapting to changing labor market requirements. State and local workforce investment boards are encouraged to collaborate with public and private institutions to align resources and build a well-articulated workforce investment system. This includes adopting local and regional training strategies to address the needs of job seekers, workers, and employers within regional labor markets. Workforce investment programs aim to build partnerships with education, social services, and workforce training systems to fill skills gaps. Programs should be data-driven, involve industry in needs assessment, and measure outcomes like program completion and employment. The California Workforce Investment Board and Labor and Workforce Development Agency aim to provide accessible programs for individuals with employment barriers. Definitions for terms like career pathways and cluster-based sector strategies are outlined in the Unemployment Insurance Code. The focus is on data-driven decision-making for investments and policies based on labor market analysis. \"Economic security for workers involves earning a sufficient wage to support a family, save for emergencies, and have retirement income. Evidence-based policies rely on research for positive outcomes, while high-priority occupations are in-demand jobs that provide economic security.\" An \"individual with employment barriers\" is someone with characteristics that limit their ability to find work, such as poor work history, lack of experience, or disabilities. An \"industry cluster\" is a group of closely linked employers in a specific region sharing common resources and technologies. An industry or sector partnership is a collaborative effort that brings together key stakeholders in a specific industry cluster to address workforce needs. This partnership involves multiple firms, labor groups, education providers, and workforce systems working together to develop strategies for workforce development. The goal is to address short-term and long-term human capital needs by analyzing labor markets, identifying barriers to employment, creating skill standards and training programs, and establishing career advancement opportunities for workers of all skill levels within the industry. An industry or sector partnership involves representatives from various organizations such as labor groups, educational institutions, workforce agencies, government entities, economic development agencies, chambers of commerce, and nonprofit organizations. These partnerships aim to address workforce needs within a specific industry cluster by collaborating on strategies for workforce development and creating opportunities for career advancement. Sector strategies prioritize investments in industry sectors based on growth potential, focusing on workforce training programs leading to secure jobs, boosting productivity, and addressing skills gaps through education and training programs. Sector strategies may target underserved communities, disconnected youths, incumbent workers, and military veterans. They are often implemented through industry partnerships at the regional level, but can also be at the state or local level based on sector needs. The \"Workforce Investment Act of 1998\" defines federal regulations, and \"Labor market area\" refers to integrated geographic areas for employment. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"Recognized postsecondary credential\" and \"Core program provision\" under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It also mentions specific sections of the United States Code related to core programs. The Unemployment Insurance Code is being amended in Section 14010. The California Workforce Investment Board is responsible for aligning education and workforce systems to the needs of the 21st century economy. A new Article 4 in the Unemployment Insurance Code focuses on regional planning in accordance with the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The California Workforce Investment Board aligns education and workforce systems with the needs of the 21st-century economy. A new Article 4 in the Unemployment Insurance Code focuses on regional planning under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

Technical assistance and labor market data will be provided for planning and service delivery. No reimbursement is needed as this act implements federal law."
