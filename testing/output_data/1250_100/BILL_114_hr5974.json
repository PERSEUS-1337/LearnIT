    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coptic Churches Accountability Act\". In August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, announced that the army would rebuild the damaged churches. President Sisi also attended a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy in January 2015, showing support for the community affected by sectarian violence. In August 2013, sectarian violence in Egypt led to the burning of churches and Christian buildings. The Egyptian military has restored 26 out of 78 damaged churches, while private citizens have repaired 23 buildings. However, 29 buildings in 24 locations still need restoration as of September 2016. A new law passed in August 2016 imposes challenges on church construction, with government approval often being used as a pretext for violence against Christians in Egypt. In March 2015, violence erupted in El-`Our, Minya, Egypt, as villagers protested the construction of a new church honoring Christians beheaded by Da'esh militants. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails attacked the existing village church, set fire to a Christian-owned vehicle, and threw bricks at another Christian's house. Government officials engage in reconciliation sessions to address sectarian violence, but human rights groups question the effectiveness of these sessions. The United States actively promotes international protection of religious minorities and their faith-based practices. The Coptic Church, representing the largest Christian community in the Middle East, has been in Egypt for over 2,000 years. Religious freedom is crucial for democracy, individual liberty, and stability. Religious freedom is a priority value for the United States to promote in its engagement with other countries. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Secretary of State must provide a report to Congress every year until 2021 on the progress of restoring Christian religious properties in Egypt, discussing any interactions with Egyptian officials, the implementation of church construction permits, and the analysis of Egyptian laws and policies. The Secretary of State must ensure that annual reports on human rights practices and international religious freedom for Egypt include information on the construction of Christian churches and the damage or destruction of Christian religious properties. Several Christian churches were burned, damaged, or destroyed during the sectarian violence in August 2013."
