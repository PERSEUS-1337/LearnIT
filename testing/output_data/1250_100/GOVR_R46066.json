Key deliverables included a new Readiness Initiative, declaration of space as a new operational domain, increased defense spending by European allies and Canada, renewed commitment to missions in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts, assessment of China's impact on NATO, and initiation of a reflection process to strengthen NATO's political dimension. The importance of strong U.S.-European relations was emphasized. The London meeting in December 2019 focused on NATO's evolution from a collective defense organization to a globally engaged security alliance of 30 members. There were tensions regarding U.S. commitment to NATO, criticism of Turkey's actions, and ongoing transatlantic cooperation highlighted by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The Trump Administration's commitment to NATO was emphasized in London, with President Trump highlighting NATO's purpose. Increased defense spending across the alliance was credited to President Trump, amid concerns of renewed Russian aggression. NATO leaders reaffirmed their dedication to readiness and deterrence initiatives, including declaring space as an operational domain. Discussions also covered NATO's mission in Afghanistan, counterterrorism efforts, and the implications of China's engagement with Europe. In response to Russia's actions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, the United States has supported NATO's focus on territorial defense and deterring Russian aggression. NATO member states have deployed troops to the Baltic States and Poland, increased military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe, and established new command structures. Efforts in London included initiatives to enhance NATO's readiness, such as the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative proposed by the United States. Some analysts question the effectiveness and sustainability of these deterrence initiatives. Some NATO allies question the effectiveness of deterrence initiatives in response to Russian aggression. Poland and Baltic States urge more forces deployment for deterrence, while Western European countries emphasize a dual-track approach combining deterrence with dialogue. Concerns about violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act limit permanent troop deployments in newer NATO member countries. NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) is described as continuous but rotational. In London, NATO allies declared space as a new operational domain and highlighted progress in responding to cyber and hybrid threats. NATO has adopted measures to protect networks from cyberattacks, provide Cyber Rapid Reaction Teams, and establish a new NATO Cyberspace Operations Center in Brussels. The center aims to integrate national cyber capabilities into NATO missions and operations, focusing on cyber defense at all levels of planning. NATO also enhances capabilities to counter hybrid warfare threats through strategic communications and exercise scenarios. NATO leaders in London declared space as a new operational domain alongside air, land, sea, and cyber. This decision reflects a consensus within NATO to strengthen defense and deterrence in all areas, including space. NATO has no intention of deploying weapons in space and will maintain a defensive approach. NATO leaders in London declared space as a new operational domain, emphasizing a defensive approach in line with international law. President Trump has urged allies to increase defense budgets, with European allies showing substantial increases in spending. However, critics fear Trump's criticism could harm NATO cohesion. NATO members aim to allocate 2% of GDP to defense annually. At NATO's 2014 Wales Summit, allies pledged to increase defense spending and move towards the 2% guideline within a decade. European allies and Canada have added $130 billion in defense spending since 2014, with the figure expected to rise to $400 billion by 2024. While 9 allies are expected to meet the 2% guideline in 2019, Germany currently spends about 1.38% of GDP on defense and plans to reach 1.5% by 2024. President Trump and others criticize NATO members for not meeting defense-spending targets. At the Wales Summit, allied governments agreed to the Wales commitments, with a focus on the effectiveness of military capabilities rather than just defense spending levels. The alliance aims for 20% of defense expenditure to go towards new equipment and research. Secretary General Stoltenberg emphasizes a broad approach to measuring contributions using \"cash, capabilities, and contributions.\" At the London meeting, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to adjust contributions to NATO's common funds, with the U.S. and Germany each contributing about 16%. This decision was made despite speculation about a possible drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. NATO launched the Resolute Support Mission in 2015 to assist Afghan security forces. As of February 2020, there were 8,500 troops from NATO members and partners in the mission. The top contributors after the U.S. were Germany, the UK, Italy, Georgia, and Romania. NATO supports peaceful settlement efforts in Afghanistan and will adjust its mission based on agreements, while reaffirming its commitment to Afghan security forces. NATO has launched initiatives to counter terrorism and address instability in the Middle East and North Africa region. This includes the NATO Training Mission in Iraq, partnership activities with countries like Tunisia and Jordan, and the establishment of a NATO Regional Hub for the South in Naples, Italy. Aerial surveillance aircraft have been deployed to assist the global coalition fighting the Islamic State terrorist organization. Several factors have limited enhanced NATO engagement on security challenges in the MENA region, including allies' belief that the EU should lead Europe's response to terrorism and migration issues. France has advocated for strong European responses but opposed a larger role for NATO. Some allies are hesitant to involve NATO in security challenges that could be seen as endorsing military action. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress have urged NATO to assess the security implications of growing Chinese investment in Europe. China's strategic foothold in Europe through unfair trade practices and investments in key industries, sensitive technologies, and infrastructure, particularly in 5G networks, has raised concerns among U.S. officials. NATO has adopted a plan to address emerging concerns about 5G technology and assess risks associated with cyber threats and foreign ownership. Despite EU efforts to develop common guidelines for 5G networks, individual national governments retain decision-making authority. U.S. officials have cautioned European allies about using Huawei or other Chinese equipment, warning that it could hinder intelligence sharing with the United States. Huawei and other Chinese 5G equipment could hinder intelligence sharing with the United States due to network security concerns. UK and Germany allow Chinese companies to bid on 5G contracts but require meeting national security standards. UK excludes \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei from sensitive parts of 5G networks and critical infrastructure. Poland and Czech Republic are considering excluding Huawei due to national security risks. Despite U.S. worries about China's influence in Europe, officials are optimistic about addressing security and economic challenges together. On March 27, 2020, North Macedonia joined NATO as its 30th member. Deliberations in London highlighted tensions within the alliance on various issues, including U.S. policy towards NATO, Turkey's role, EU security, and NATO's relations with Russia. Disagreements on how to address these issues have raised concerns about NATO's future direction. President Trump's criticism of NATO has also been a point of contention among officials and analysts on both sides of the Atlantic. President Trump's criticism of NATO and lack of transatlantic coordination on Syria and Afghanistan have undermined the alliance. In London, allies agreed to strengthen NATO's political dimension. A group of experts, cochaired by Wess Mitchell and Thomas De Mazi\u00e8re, will recommend ways to reinforce Alliance unity. Concerns exist about the Trump Administration's commitment to NATO and the lasting damage his criticisms could cause. President Trump's criticisms of NATO could harm alliance cohesion and credibility. He questions NATO's value to the US and urges European allies to increase defense spending. Despite expressing commitment to NATO in London, concerns persist about US-European strategic rifts on key foreign policy issues. European countries are concerned about the lack of U.S. coordination on policy in Syria, especially after the U.S. drawdown of forces in October 2019. French President Macron criticized the lack of strategic decision-making between the U.S. and its NATO allies, leading to what he called the \"brain death of NATO.\" President Trump dismissed Macron's criticism, emphasizing the importance of NATO. Macron criticized Turkey's actions in Syria and its planned deployment of a Russian air defense system, raising concerns about its NATO membership. NATO has invested in military facilities in Turkey and provided air defense support. Stoltenberg urged Turkey to act with restraint and preserve gains against ISIS. Turkey has invoked Article 4 of NATO's treaty three times since 2012 for high-level consultations. NATO allies expressed solidarity with Turkey in response to air strikes in Idlib province by the Syrian regime and Russia. NATO has provided air defense support and surveillance to Turkey along its border with Syria. Some allies have cast doubts on the deployment of air defense systems after Turkey's military incursion into northern Syria in October 2019. Italy withdrew its air defense system from Turkey in December 2019, while Spain continues to deploy a Patriot missile battery along Turkey's border. Secretary General Stoltenberg has expressed concerns about Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system. Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system is a concern for NATO, with some leaders suggesting excluding Turkey from NATO's defense systems. The North Atlantic Treaty does not allow for action against a member without consent, but the US and other allies could adjust cooperation with Turkey. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper called for diplomatic and economic measures in response to Turkey's actions. European leaders, like French President Macron, see the need for coordinated European defense capabilities amid uncertainty about the US role in European security. The EU has been working on developing its Common Security and Defense Policy to enhance European military capabilities, despite challenges such as flat defense budgets. Recent initiatives include the European Defense Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg supports EU defense integration as long as it strengthens the European pillar within NATO and avoids duplicating NATO capacities. The Trump Administration has concerns about the European Defense Fund (EDF) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) potentially limiting U.S. defense companies' involvement in pan-European military projects. Supporters of EU defense integration argue that PESCO's projects align with NATO priorities, including enhancing military mobility in Europe. Congress has historically supported NATO, but during the Trump Administration, this support was seen as a reassurance to allies following President Trump's criticisms of the alliance. During the Trump Administration, Congress reaffirmed U.S. support for NATO in response to President Trump's criticisms. Congressional hearings reflected disagreement over Trump's impact on the alliance, with some arguing his criticism led to increased defense spending by NATO members. Critics argue that President Trump's actions have damaged relationships with U.S. allies and undermined NATO's credibility. They fear this could embolden adversaries like Russia and weaken allies' commitment to the alliance. Despite disagreements, most Members of Congress support strong U.S. leadership in NATO to address threats from Russia and advocate for enhanced military responses to Russian aggression. Some lawmakers are also questioning whether NATO should take action against allies like Turkey for policies that could threaten alliance security. Members of Congress are urged to address key questions regarding NATO's future, including the strategic value of NATO to the United States, the need for a new strategic concept reflecting current security threats, NATO's capacity to address security threats in the Euro-Atlantic region, consequences of member states failing to meet defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, allies' contributions to NATO deterrence efforts, options to sanction allies jeopardizing security, and the commitment to NATO's enlargement policy. The curr_chunk discusses NATO's commitment to its \"open door\" policy on enlargement, focusing on Georgia and Ukraine's membership aspirations, and developing a NATO strategy towards China amidst concerns about Chinese investment in Europe."
