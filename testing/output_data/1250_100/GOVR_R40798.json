    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force. The rate can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, while it may increase if more people start actively seeking employment. During a recession, the unemployment rate may rise even when the economy is improving, as firms are hesitant to hire until they are certain of sustained growth. Job growth may be delayed as employers first increase production with existing workers before hiring new ones. Labor force participation can increase if people believe the economy is getting better. The Current Employment Statistics program surveys nonfarm employers monthly about their payroll numbers, providing more accurate job data than the Current Population Survey. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses GDP and employment trends to determine recessions. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates typically peak after recessions end. The unemployment rate peaked at different points in 10 recessions since World War II. In some cases, it peaked during the recession, while in others, it continued to rise for several months after the recession had ended. Job growth did not consistently occur until after the recession had ended, with only one instance of immediate job growth following a short recession in January-July 1980. Following the January-July 1980 recession, immediate job growth was observed. However, in nine other cases, job numbers fluctuated for months post-recession. Job growth typically began within three to five months of the start of recoveries, but in the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, job growth was significantly delayed, leading to jobless recoveries. Despite private sector job growth starting in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments have slowed overall job growth."
