    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1998\". The United States has been a leader in containing the spread of nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons is now a major threat to national security. The UN Security Council recognizes the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Regional nuclear arms races increase the risk of nuclear weapon use. The deteriorating conditions at nuclear weapons complex sites in Russia have raised concerns about the country's ability to track its nuclear materials, increasing the threat of nuclear proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports. North Korea and the United States exchanged nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment in October 1994. North Korea's history of pursuing nuclear weapons capability raises concerns about nuclear proliferation. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in various regions to enhance security interests. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in Africa and the South Pacific to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA works to counter proliferation but faces challenges due to institutional and financial constraints. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage and disposal challenges and could be used for nuclear weapons if in the wrong hands. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further nuclear proliferation. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reaffirms the United States' commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and aims to strengthen the international nuclear nonproliferation regime. The US seeks to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, roll back proliferation, and prevent their use worldwide through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION POLICY. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads with Russia, negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals, and enforcing agreements to decrease nuclear arsenals significantly. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by halting the production of weapons-usable fissile materials, placing existing stockpiles under international controls, and strengthening IAEA safeguards. Additionally, they seek to strengthen nuclear and dual-use export controls in nuclear supplier nations. The United States and other nuclear supplier nations impose sanctions on entities contributing to nuclear proliferation, increase transparency on nuclear export licenses, ratify the IAEA's Strengthened Safeguards System program, reduce incentives for nuclear weapons acquisition, strengthen regional security agreements, and advocate for UN Security Council enforcement of nonproliferation agreements. They also aim to adopt a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states and provide immediate assistance to NPT parties in case of nuclear weapon use. Additionally, they seek a verifiable bilateral agreement with Russia for mutual nuclear weapons withdrawal. The Russian Federation and the United States aim to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons and extend this zero option to all nuclear weapon states. They also plan to ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's nuclear activities, and start negotiations on START III before START II comes into force. The President must report to Congress every year on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries. Reports must be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. Definitions are also provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"fissile materials,\" \"highly enriched uranium,\" \"IAEA,\" \"IAEA safeguards,\" \"no first use,\" \"non-nuclear weapon state,\" \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" and \"nuclear weapon state.\" The Act defines terms related to nuclear weapons and treaties, including the START I, START II, and START III treaties signed between the United States, Soviet Union, and Russian Federation."
