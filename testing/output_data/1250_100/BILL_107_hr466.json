    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"PART L--RESOURCE STAFF FOR STUDENTS\" with a specific finding outlined in section 10993. Congress finds that there is a significant need for more mental health professionals in schools to address the lack of services for children, with the current student-to-counselor ratio being 513:1, far above the recommended ratio of 250:1. Existing counselors are overwhelmed with administrative tasks and student populations are expected to increase, further highlighting the demand for school-based mental health services. Federal support is needed to reduce the student-to-staff ratio in schools, as more than 100,000 new resource staff for students will be required due to expected retirements. This support would lead to decreased violence and substance abuse, as well as improved academic achievement. The purpose of this part is to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 school-based resource staff to work with students in grades 6-12 to reduce student-to-counseling ratios, address students' mental and emotional needs, and support school staff in early intervention and identifying signs of violence. The Secretary will provide grants to local educational agencies to support resource staff for students' needs, ensuring fair distribution nationwide. Grants will last up to 3 years, with agencies submitting applications describing targeted student populations and available counseling resources. The program funded by the Secretary will provide resource staff to local educational agencies to meet specific student needs. The program activities, services, and training will be tailored to address these needs, with a focus on evaluating outcomes and effectiveness. Qualified personnel must be in place to develop and administer the program, and funds should supplement existing resources without replacing them. The funds allocated to agencies must be used in accordance with the purposes outlined in section 10994. The term 'resource staff' in this program refers to individuals with mental health training and qualifications to provide services to children in a school setting. They must have state licensure, national certification, a master's degree in school counseling, and specific hours of training in school psychology. The program requires resource staff in school settings to have state licensure or certification in school psychology, social work, or school social work specialist credential. Appropriations of $2.8 billion for 2002, $3 billion for 2003, $3.2 billion for 2004, and $3.5 billion for 2005 and beyond are authorized."
