    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teachers in the Classroom Act\". It includes findings related to teachers. Congress finds that enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at record levels, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The increase in student enrollment will continue for the next decade, requiring the hiring of 150,000 additional teachers. This growth will particularly impact high poverty urban and rural areas, as well as states with rapid population growth. The Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio project (Project STAR) in Tennessee shows that students in smaller classes learn more in the early grades, maintain an academic advantage even after returning to normal-sized classes, and that adding students to a classroom diminishes learning for the rest. It is crucial to adequately educate children for the future and improve the learning environment by hiring new teachers without increasing bureaucracy, deficit, or debt. Congress should provide resources to accommodate growing enrollment and potentially reduce class sizes. The grant program is established. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to receive the grant, and local educational agencies must establish a trust fund to hire new teachers within 2 years of receiving funds. The agency receiving funds must adhere to specific accounting practices, increase the number of teachers, review personnel performance annually, limit employment period to one year, repay unspent funds within 27 months, and use funds only as a supplement for education programs. The agency must annually apply to the Governor to receive funding under this Act for the education of students in assisted programs, without supplanting funds. SEC. 4. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. Each State receives funds based on the number of children aged 5-17. Unused funds are reallocated to other States. SEC. 5. FISCAL REQUIREMENTS. The agency must apply for funding without supplanting funds. SEC. 5. FISCAL REQUIREMENTS. A Governor can withhold payments to a local educational agency for noncompliance with section 3(c) after 60 days of notice. The agency must increase teachers or qualified personnel to continue receiving funds. A Governor receiving a grant under this Act must select local educational agencies based on the need to alleviate overcrowded classes. They must evaluate and report on the funds used by the agencies annually, with a limit of 2% for administrative costs and 10% for innovative teaching programs. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with Governors, must report annually to Congress on the effectiveness of programs assisted under this Act and provide recommendations for program continuity.

DEFINITION: Defines \"local educational agency,\" \"State,\" and \"Secretary\" for the purposes of this Act.\n\nSEC. 9.
