    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Energy Development Act of 1997\" includes provisions for alternative fuels, such as definitions, amendments to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and minimum federal fleet requirements. It also covers state and local incentives programs, alternative fuel use in various vehicles, and mandates for alternative fuel providers. Section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include definitions related to alternative fuels, such as domestically produced renewable biological materials and heavy-duty motor vehicles. The amendments also cover the capability of motor vehicles and marine vessels to operate on alternative fuels, gasoline, diesel fuel, or approved blends. The term 'marine vessel' is defined as a motorized watercraft used primarily on US navigable waters. Paragraph (15) is amended to include domestically produced renewable biological materials like biodiesel. SEC. 102 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is being amended to include domestically produced renewable biological materials like biodiesel. Section 400AA of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow existing fleet vehicles to be converted to use alternative fuels during major overhauls or rebuilds, and to acquire vehicles already converted to use alternative fuels. Additionally, subsection (g) specifies that renewable biological materials, including biodiesel, must be used in mixtures of at least 20 percent by volume in certain vehicles. Section 400AA of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow existing fleet vehicles to be converted to use alternative fuels during major overhauls or rebuilds, and to acquire vehicles already converted to use alternative fuels, including renewable biological materials like biodiesel in certain vehicles.

SEC. 103. MINIMUM FEDERAL FLEET REQUIREMENT. Section 303 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to allow Federal fleets to acquire heavy duty alternative fueled vehicles in place of light duty vehicles and to receive credits for the purchase and use of alternative fuel in dual-fueled vehicles or marine vessels. The Secretary may request a Federal agency to provide an accounting of the purchase of dual-fueled vehicles or alternative fuel. Guidelines for this request will be included in the required guidelines under section 308. The Secretary will implement this subsection in a manner that is neutral with respect to the type of fuel and vehicle used. TITLE II--ALTERNATIVE FUELS--NON-FEDERAL PROGRAMS\nSEC. 201. STATE AND LOCAL INCENTIVES PROGRAMS. Establishment of Program amends Section 409(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to include light and heavy duty alternative fueled vehicles and increase the use of alternative fuels. This includes incentives, reporting requirements, and assistance towards the use of alternative fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to provide federal assistance to states for the purchase cost of alternative fuels and to increase the use of alternative fuels in vehicles. This includes incentives, reporting requirements, and assistance towards the consumption of alternative fuels. SEC. 202 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include the incremental cost of alternative fuels in flexible fueled school buses and the conversion of school buses to alternative fueled vehicles. SEC. 203 addresses alternative fuel use in nonroad vehicles, engines, and marine vessels. Section 412 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include marine vessels in addition to vehicles and engines. It also specifies the timeframe for studies to be conducted every 2, 6, and 10 years. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include marine vessels in studies conducted every 2, 6, and 10 years. Amendments also specify the inclusion of marine vessels in transportation regulations. TITLE III--AVAILABILITY AND USE OF REPLACEMENT FUELS, ALTERNATIVE FUELS, AND ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES\n\nSEC. 301. MANDATE FOR ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROVIDERS. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to allow the conversion of existing fleet vehicles into dual-fueled alternative fueled vehicles during major overhauls or rebuilds, under the original equipment manufacturer's warranty.\n\nSEC. 302. REPLACEMENT FUEL SUPPLY AND DEMAND PROGRAM. SEC. 302 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include heavy vehicles in the fuel supply and demand program, with reporting requirements every 5 years through 2008. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include fleet program purchase goals, fleet requirement program adjustments, and conversions to heavy-duty alternative fueled vehicles. Fleet substitutions are permitted, and rules for conversions are clarified. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to allow fleet owners to convert existing vehicles into alternative fueled vehicles for compliance with the title. Fleet owners can receive credits for the conversion and purchase of alternative fuel. Additionally, mandatory state fleet programs now include new light or heavy vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include new light or heavy duty alternative fueled vehicles in state fleet programs. This involves inserting \"or heavy\" after \"new light\" and \"or converted\" after \"acquired\" in the text. Additionally, the Biodiesel Energy Development Act of 1997 is specified in the amendment. SEC. 305. CREDITS. Section 508(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include additional alternative fueled vehicles and allocate credits for acquiring alternative fuel for dual-fueled vehicles. Section 508(b) is also amended to specify the allocation of credits for dual-fueled vehicles and alternative fuel. When allocating credits under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary will allocate 2 credits for acquiring or converting a dual-fueled vehicle and acquiring alternative fuel equal to the estimated need for 1 year. This applies if the dual-fueled vehicle acquired exceeds the required number or is acquired before the deadline specified in the title. SEC. 306 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to recommend exempting replacement fuels from taxes on non-replacement fuels and including converters in the conversion and warranty of motor vehicles into alternative fueled vehicles."
