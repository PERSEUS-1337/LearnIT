    "content": "The Act titled \"Improvement of Information Access Act of 1993\" is cited as the short title. The Congress recognizes the importance of a well-informed citizenry, access to government information, modern technology use by federal agencies, and the public's right to affordable access to government information. Government information is considered a national resource and economic asset that belongs to the public, and taxpayers should not have to pay excessive fees for its access. Federal agencies lack information policies, standards for record formats, and timely access to government information products and services at reasonable costs. SEC. 3. IMPROVED PUBLIC ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION. Title 44, United States Code, amended by adding new chapter: \"CHAPTER 41--INFORMATION DISSEMINATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES.\" The government is required to provide a report each year detailing its information dissemination policies and practices, including plans for new products and services, efforts to improve accessibility, and progress in creating comprehensive indexes. Each year, government departments must publish a report in the Federal Register detailing their information dissemination policies, methods for public access, provisions for protecting outdated records, awareness efforts, and responses to public comments. The report must also include a notice for public comments to be submitted within a 90-day period. The public can provide comments on the information dissemination policies and practices of government departments, including the types of information collected, methods of dissemination, pricing, and the quality of information. Comments are made available for public inspection, and departments must facilitate dialogue with the public through hearings and forums to discuss information dissemination policies. Before discontinuing an information product or service, an agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register or through other means, allowing a 120-day comment period for public feedback. The agency must explain the reasons for discontinuation and consider the received comments. Additionally, agencies are required to disseminate information through various modes and outlets to ensure timely, useful, and reliable access to government information. The government must ensure timely, useful, and reliable access to information for the public through standardized formats and free or low-cost distribution channels. Agencies are prohibited from charging depository libraries for information distribution costs or royalties for the use of government information. The incremental cost of distributing information does not include costs of collecting or organizing it. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will issue model performance standards for agencies to provide public records access. Agencies must provide requested public documents by mail within a specified period. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will issue model performance standards for providing access to agency records under section 4101(f) of title 44, United States Code."
