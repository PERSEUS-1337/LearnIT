    "content": "Veterans' employment outcomes in the civilian sector are a congressional concern, with various programs in place to assist them. This report discusses trends, issues, and programs related to veterans' employment. It provides data on employment outcomes, recent trends, and existing programs that offer services to veterans, including general programs, programs for veterans with disabilities, and competitive grant programs. The report aims to give a broad overview without listing all available programs or providing comprehensive information on each. The report provides a broad overview of veterans' employment programs and initiatives, with data on employment outcomes for Gulf War Era II veterans, veterans from prior service periods, and nonveterans. The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is highlighted in Table 1, cautioning against direct comparisons due to varying characteristics among the groups. The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is higher than other veterans and nonveterans. GWII veterans make up less than a quarter of the veteran labor force. Factors like age and education levels influence their unemployment rate. The educational distribution of veterans affects their employment outcomes, with unclear effects. Approximately 16% of all veterans and 29% of GWII veterans have service-connected disabilities. Veterans with disabilities have similar labor force participation rates but GWII veterans with disabilities are less likely to participate. Recent veterans in transition are categorized as unemployed, impacting GWII veterans' unemployment rates. The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is typically higher than nonveterans, while other veterans have lower unemployment rates. The average unemployment rate over six years was 9.8% for GWII veterans, 6.9% for other veterans, and 8.0% for nonveterans. GWII veterans' unemployment rate is more dynamic than other populations, likely due to small sample sizes rather than abrupt changes. The unemployment rate trends similarly for different veteran groups, with an upward trend followed by a decline. The report focuses on employment and training programs for active duty veterans, excluding reserve members and their families. It also discusses the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The report discusses employment and training programs for active duty veterans, categorized into programs broadly available to veterans, programs targeting veterans with service-connected disabilities, and competitive grant programs. Detailed eligibility criteria are generally not presented, with a focus on programs available to most veterans. In 1990, Congress authorized benefits to assist military personnel in transitioning to civilian life, leading to the creation of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP offers pre-separation services and counseling on various transition-related topics for separating Armed Forces members, including employment issues and skills translation to civilian occupations. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) provides services for veterans transitioning to civilian life, including assistance with military skills translation to civilian occupations, professional certifications, public service opportunities, self-employment, and education/training assistance. TAP is conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The curriculum was revised in 2012 to Transition GPS to align with the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. The VOW Act made participation in TAP mandatory for separating military personnel and required individualized assessments for civilian employment. The Transition GPS program was introduced in 2012 at military bases, now conducted nationwide, with a core curriculum to ensure servicemembers are \"career ready\" upon leaving military service. The Transition GPS program includes a mandatory five-day core curriculum for separating servicemembers, with smaller class sizes for individual attention. Servicemembers develop a standardized individual transition plan tied to personal goals and must meet career readiness standards for successful completion. Optional tracks for higher education, entrepreneurship, and technical training are available, each lasting two days. The program concludes with a capstone event to verify career readiness and a viable transition plan. The Transition GPS program offers optional tracks for higher education, entrepreneurship, and technical training, each lasting two days. Efforts are ongoing to align military training with civilian credentials and licenses, enabling servicemembers to obtain civilian credentials while enlisted or apply military experience to civilian licensing requirements after discharge. Initiatives are in place to increase enlisted personnel's access to civilian credentials, including a pilot program to assess the feasibility of obtaining civilian credentialing for military occupational specialties. The pilot program included occupational specialties like aircraft mechanics, automotive mechanics, health care support, logistics, and truck driving. The program aimed to provide credentials aligned with military service, such as non-DOD government licenses and certifications from industry-recognized agencies. Efforts are being made to translate military training and skills into civilian credentials, with state programs considering military experience for licensing. Army Directive 2015-12 provides guidance on implementing a credentialing program and Career Skills Program. State programs are developing ways to consider military training for licensing requirements. The Veterans Skills to Jobs Act allows federal licensing authorities to accept relevant military training for licenses. The VA offers educational assistance programs, like the GI Bills, to help veterans transition to civilian life, provide education benefits, and support recruitment and retention in the military. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty are the most utilized programs, offering benefits for 36 months of schooling. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides separate payments for tuition, fees, supplies, housing, and other costs. Maximum benefits for tuition and fees vary by institution type. Monthly housing allowances range from $800 to $3,700. MGIB-AD offers a single monthly payment for education and living expenses. Benefits are available within 15 years for Post-9/11 GI Bill and 10 years for MGIB-AD. GI Bill benefits do not affect eligibility for Pell Grants. In FY2016, VA estimated $13.0 billion in benefits for Post-9/11 GI Bill and MGIB-AD. Veterans receive priority of service in DOL programs at AJCs, including job search assistance and subsidized training. DOL's Gold Card initiative offers intensive employment services for post-9/11 veterans. The Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) program provides funding for personnel positions within the American Job Center (AJC) system to assist veterans with job readiness assessments, career guidance, and training referrals. Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVER) outreach to employers and facilitate employment services, while Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP) personnel provide intensive services to veterans with barriers to employment. In FY2015, $175 million was appropriated for JVSG activities. In FY2015, $175 million was appropriated for JVSG activities. President Obama launched a Veterans Employment Center on the VA website to assist veterans in finding local jobs, building resumes, and identifying civilian jobs matching their military skills. Veterans receive preference in federal government employment through various programs and policies, giving them advantages in the hiring process. Veterans may receive preference points based on their qualifications, with a 5-point preference for those who served during a war or in specified campaigns, and a 10-point preference for those with a service-connected disability or Purple Heart. This preference can raise a veteran's score over 100 in the application process. In some cases, a category rating system is used to evaluate applicants, with preference-eligible veterans listed ahead of non-preference-eligible veterans. Several hiring programs exist for qualified veterans to be appointed to federal positions without competing with the general public. Eligibility criteria include being separated from the Armed Forces for less than three years, serving in a combat mission, or being disabled. President Obama's Executive Order 13518 aimed to enhance recruitment and employment opportunities for veterans in the executive branch, establishing a Council on Veterans Employment and requiring agencies to develop specific plans for promoting veterans' employment. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers programs to assist veterans in developing and managing small businesses, financing, and acquiring federal contracts. Congressional interest has grown due to reports of veterans facing challenges accessing these programs. The SBA provides management and technical assistance training to over 100,000 veterans annually through various partners. The Office of Veterans Business Development administers programs to support veteran-owned businesses. The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development offers programs to assist veteran-owned businesses, including the Boots to Business program. Since 2013, the SBA has waived loan guaranty fees for SBA 7(a) loans under $150,000 and veteran loans under the SBAExpress program. This initiative aims to increase access to capital for small business owners, including veterans. The SBA offers loan guaranty programs for veterans, with discounts on upfront fees for loans above $150,000. The agency also provides disaster assistance through the MREIDL program, offering direct loans up to $2 million for small business owners affected by military reservist call-ups. The Small Business Administration assists small businesses, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, in acquiring federal contracts through its management of procurement goals. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program provides job training and employment services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program offers various services to help veterans prepare for, obtain, or retain employment based on their abilities and interests. Services include short-term assistance like resume help, job accommodations, and long-term education and training benefits. VR&E is a widely utilized program with estimated expenditures of $1.2 billion for mandatory benefits and $313 million for discretionary services. Additionally, the Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) provides grants to states for intensive employment services for veterans with disabilities and multiple barriers to employment. The DVOP is part of DOL's JVSG program, funded at approximately $175 million in FY2015. JVSG provides employment services for disabled veterans, with specialized components in various veterans' programs. Transition Assistance Program and Transition GPS offer services for exiting servicemembers with disabilities. Disabled veterans have preference in federal hiring and special hiring authorities. Work Opportunity Tax Credit is available for businesses. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) offers tax credits for hiring veterans eligible for disability compensation. Competitive grants like the HVRP program aim to assist homeless veterans in finding employment and provide support services. The TRIO Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) program provides academic support for veterans preparing for postsecondary education. Administered by the Department of Education, it offers tutoring, assistance with college admissions, and financial aid applications. Eligibility requires a need for academic support, with a focus on low-income and potential first-generation college students. The Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) program offers academic support for veterans preparing for postsecondary education. Eligibility criteria include being out of high school for five or more years, scoring below standard on tests, or having a disability. In FY2014, $13.7 million of TRIO funding was allocated to VUB projects. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provided a tax credit for employers hiring qualified veterans, but authorization expired in 2014. DOL guidance allowed for new WOTC applications to be accepted, pending reauthorization by Congress. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provided tax credits for hiring veterans based on specific criteria and credit amounts, which expired after December 31, 2014. Credits ranged from $2,400 to $9,600 depending on the veteran's circumstances such as receiving SNAP benefits, being unemployed, or eligible for disability compensation from the VA."
