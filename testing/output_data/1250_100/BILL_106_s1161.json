Any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation should include a statement of the US foreign policy or national security objective, provide authority for the President to refrain from imposing sanctions if in the national interest, ensure contract sanctity unless it hinders sanctions' effectiveness, allow the President to consider the impact on innocent parties, and not restrict certain actions. The legislation should not restrict humanitarian assistance, agricultural exports, or activities aimed at changing the conduct targeted by sanctions. The President must review and report on the effectiveness of sanctions annually. The evaluation of the effectiveness, objectives, multilateral support, costs, gains, and exercise of authorities related to the continued imposition of sanctions are key considerations. SEC. 5. GUIDELINES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. SEC. 5 provides guidelines for Congress when considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation. This includes ensuring complete information on costs and gains, considering international legal obligations, assessing consistency with existing sanctions, and accounting for administrative costs. When considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should evaluate the likelihood of each sanction achieving its objective, the importance to US national interests, the impact on humanitarian conditions and activities, relations with allies, national security and foreign policy interests, and diplomatic efforts to achieve the legislation's goals. When evaluating new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should consider the likelihood of multilateral adoption, existence of alternative measures, potential retaliation against US interests, and harm to US business and international reputation. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE. The House and Senate cannot consider new unilateral economic sanctions legislation unless it includes specific requirements. Any new sanctions legislation is considered a Federal private sector mandate and must be assessed for its impact on the US economy, trade, employment, and international reputation.

The President should adopt guidelines for imposing sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Procedures for public outreach should be established to inform the public about policy developments. Rules regarding sanctions imposed by the Executive Branch or statutory enactments should be followed.
