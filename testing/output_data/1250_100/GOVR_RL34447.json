Violating this rule can lead to revocation of their status or taxation on political expenditures. Only two churches have lost their 501(c)(3) status for campaign intervention, including the Church at Pierce Creek in New York. The Johnson Amendment, named after Senator Lyndon Johnson, prohibits campaign intervention for organizations with 501(c)(3) status. Violating this rule can lead to revocation of tax-exempt status. Some organizations, such as The Way International and Christian Broadcasting Network, settled with the IRS over revocations. Other political activities are permitted under IRC Section 501(c)(3), but campaign intervention is prohibited. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status are prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates, but they can engage in other political activities like issue advocacy and voter education. The IRS cautions that any election-related activities should not show bias towards any candidate to avoid campaign intervention. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status can engage in political activities like issue advocacy and voter education, but they are prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates. When inviting candidates to appear, they must ensure no bias is shown, provide equal opportunities to all candidates, and maintain a nonpartisan atmosphere. Non-candidate individuals speaking at events should do so in a nonpartisan capacity, with no campaign activity or fundraising involved. The tax laws allow religious leaders to participate in campaign activities as individuals, endorsing or opposing candidates in their private capacity. However, they should not represent their house of worship or use its resources for campaign-related statements. IRS inquiries into a house of worship's tax status must adhere to special rules to avoid violating the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. IRC Section 7611 provides special rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and other houses of worship regarding campaign activity. An \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must reasonably believe that the house of worship may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status to initiate an inquiry. The IRS must provide written notice to the entity, including an explanation of the inquiry's subject matter and concerns. If the entity's response is inadequate, the IRS may proceed to examine its records and activities, providing a second written notice with details of the examination process. The IRS has specific rules for tax inquiries and examinations of churches and houses of worship under IRC Section 7611. An \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must believe the entity may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status to start an inquiry. Approval from IRS counsel is required for revocation of status, notice of deficiency, or tax assessment. The IRS is limited in further inquiries within a five-year period. The determination of \"reasonable belief\" was previously made by the Director of Exempt Organizations, Examinations. The IRS has rules for tax inquiries of churches and houses of worship under IRC Section 7611. The determination of \"reasonable belief\" was previously made by the Director of Exempt Organizations, Examinations. Proposed regulations aim to have the Director, Exempt Organizations make the determination, but some argue the position is not high-ranking enough. Finalizing the regulations has been a priority for the IRS, with concerns that failure to do so hinders enforcement. Some believe the political campaign prohibition for churches violates First Amendment rights, though two U.S. Courts of Appeals have upheld the prohibition. In 1972, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the prohibition against First Amendment challenges regarding a non-church religious organization's 501(c)(3) status revocation for violating lobbying and campaign activity restrictions. The court rejected the argument that the restrictions violated the organization's First Amendment rights, stating that Congress can withhold tax exemption privileges for nonprofit religious organizations. The Tenth Circuit upheld lobbying and campaign activity limitations for nonprofit religious organizations, stating that tax exemption is a privilege, not a right, and that organizations can choose to limit activities for tax-exempt status. The court found the limitations did not violate free speech rights and were justified to maintain separation of church and state. In 2000, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate free exercise and free speech rights. The church had placed ads against Bill Clinton before the election, leading to the IRS revoking its status. The court found the revocation did not substantially burden the church's right to freely exercise its religion. The court upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate free exercise and free speech rights. The church could set up a related 501(c)(4) social welfare organization to establish a political action committee (PAC) for its activities. The court rejected the church's claim of viewpoint discrimination by the IRS, stating the campaign prohibition was viewpoint neutral for all 501(c)(3) organizations. The IRS initiated a campaign prohibition in 2004 to address concerns of violations by 501(c)(3) organizations. It involved public outreach and a fast-track review process. Results from 2004 and 2006 showed 132 cases reviewed, with 22 not warranting examination. The initiative has not been updated since 2008, possibly due to the Living Word Christian Center decision impacting IRS procedures. In 2007, the IRS closed 46 out of 47 cases involving houses of worship for campaign activity violations. Mitigating factors prevented penalties in some cases, such as one-time nature of activity or reliance on counsel's advice. Impermissible activities included distributing biased voter guides and allowing candidates to use church facilities. In 2006, the IRS examined 44 cases involving houses of worship, closing 14 cases with written advisories issued in four. The IRS examined campaign activity in 14 cases involving houses of worship, finding violations in four cases. They also found 269 apparent incidences of contributions, with 87 involving church contributions totaling $45,151. The IRS closed 46 out of 47 cases in 2007 for campaign activity violations. The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations from using general treasury funds for contributions in federal elections. The Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC invalidated some of these prohibitions. The Supreme Court ruled that prohibitions in FECA on corporations and labor unions making independent expenditures and electioneering communications violate the First Amendment. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status are generally not allowed to engage in these activities. The definition of electioneering under the IRC and FECA may differ, impacting issue advocacy communications. In the 112th Congress, legislation has been introduced to repeal the provision prohibiting 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, from engaging in campaign activity. If enacted, they could participate in campaign activity without losing tax-exempt status, as long as it's not their primary activity. Reporting requirements would remain unchanged, with houses of worship not required to file Form 990. The bill would allow houses of worship to engage in campaign activities without reporting to the IRS. It does not affect the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Previous Congresses had different approaches to this issue."
