The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" modifies a long-term contract for the Tongass National Forest. Definitions include terms like \"board feet\" and \"contracting officer.\" Congress finds the importance of mid-market criteria and proportionality in timber sales. The purchaser is the Ketchikan Pulp Company. The Forest Service and a purchaser entered into a contract in 1951 to harvest timber from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The contract aims to provide timber for the purchaser's facilities on a long-term basis. A pulp mill in southeast Alaska is essential for creating jobs, utilizing low-grade wood, and maintaining a stable economy. The purchaser plans to improve its mill environmentally and operationally. The purchaser has invested $25,000,000 in environmental improvements and energy efficiency projects in Ketchikan, Alaska. The contract is set to be extended for 15 years to allow for the amortization of these projects, which are crucial for the city's economy and job base. The purchaser aims to maintain a long-term commitment to Ketchikan and southeast Alaska by utilizing local workforce, contractors, vendors, and suppliers. The purchaser in Ketchikan, Alaska has invested $25,000,000 in environmental improvements and energy efficiency projects. They plan to extend the contract for 15 years to support the city's economy and job base. The purchaser is committed to hiring local employees and working with contractors, vendors, and suppliers in southeast Alaska. They also prioritize participation in land management planning, sustainable use of forest resources, and protection of air, water, and land. Additionally, they are dedicated to exploring new processes and technology for maximizing timber use. The national interest is served by proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, fair return for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth in southeast Alaska. The contract is extended by 15 years to support the economy and job base in Ketchikan, Alaska, with a focus on sustainable forest resource use and exploring new technology for maximizing timber use. The contract for timber sale offering includes a plan detailing volume, location, and schedule for timber delivery, coordinated with the Tongass Land Management Plan. Volume requirements mandate harvesting 962,500,000 board feet in 5-year increments. The Forest Service must provide at least 192,500,000 board feet per year until the next increment in 1999 to ensure orderly harvest. The contracting officer will include roads in the environmental impact statement for the 5-year operating period. Timber selected must meet mid-market criteria. Appraisals and rates will be determined using national forest timber sale procedures. Rates will not disadvantage the purchaser compared to similar enterprises in the Pacific Northwest. The Forest Service will measure proportionality based on specific criteria. The contract allows for the conversion of a pulp mill to produce other products using pulp logs. The unilateral termination clause is removed, and any modifications to the contract require mutual agreement. The modifications will take effect 45 days after the enactment of the Act. The contracting officer must modify the contract to align with the changes made by the Act. Timber volume under the existing contract will continue, with additional volume to meet the required amount."
