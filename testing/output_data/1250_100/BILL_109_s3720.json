    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Farm and Ranch Land Protection Flexibility Act of 2006\". The Act includes provisions for the Farmland Protection Program. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to define 'eligible land' as cropland, rangeland, grassland, pasture land, or forest land that is incidental to an agricultural operation. The Act also includes certification requirements for eligibility. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to define 'eligible land' as cropland, rangeland, grassland, pasture land, or forest land that is incidental to an agricultural operation. The Act also includes certification requirements for eligibility. The term 'permanent conservation easement' is defined as an interest in eligible land for the primary purpose of protecting agricultural production capacity, and a 'qualified State or local entity' is defined as one that operates a farm and ranch land protection program. The text chunk discusses the requirements for a qualified State or local entity to monitor and enforce permanent conservation easements, ensuring the purpose is upheld for the maximum duration. Financial control policies are also necessary for compliance. The text chunk outlines the certification requirements for a qualified entity to enforce permanent conservation easements, including financial control policies and strategic planning. The Secretary will carry out a farm and ranch land protection program to facilitate the purchase of conservation easements on eligible land, prioritizing protection of land with productive soils, staying in agriculture, facing conversion pressure, with local land-use planning, and benefiting watersheds. The Secretary will allocate at least 75% of funds for grants to purchase permanent conservation easements in watersheds needing farm and ranch land protection. Grants will be distributed based on the need for land protection and contributions from State or local entities. Qualified entities receiving grants must use them for conservation purposes. Qualified State or local entities receiving grants can use the funds to purchase permanent conservation easements, regardless of pending offers. The Secretary can enter agreements with these entities to purchase easements using a combination of entity funds and grant funds. Terms and conditions will be stipulated in the agreements. Qualified State or local entities can use grant funds distributed by the Secretary to purchase permanent conservation easements. Agreements with these entities authorize them to determine criteria, priorities, and terms for the easements, as long as State law allows effective enforcement of conservation purposes. Federal contingent requirements are not mandatory. The Secretary determines matching funds required for grants based on proposals from qualified State or local entities. State attorney general certification can waive Federal contingent enforcement requirements for permanent conservation easements. The Secretary determines matching funds needed for grants based on proposals from qualified State or local entities, including the amount available for conservation easements and the commitment to program priorities. Amendments in subsections address limitations on funding exceeding appraised fair market value of conservation easements. The legislation addresses the market value of conservation easements and the requirements for a qualified conservation contribution. It also adjusts the percentage required for a qualified contribution and the entities eligible to receive it. The Secretary will establish performance measures for farm and ranch land protection, including for qualified State and local entities receiving funding. The program under this section will be coordinated with the grassland reserve program to minimize redundancy. Grant funds and technical assistance will be available for a reasonable period to allow finalization of conservation easement purchases."
