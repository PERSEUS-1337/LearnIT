    "content": "Many governments recognize the international risks posed by environmental degradation and climate change, leading to the negotiation of international agreements to protect the environment and promote sustainable growth. Lower-income countries may struggle to implement environmentally protective measures due to financial constraints, leading to the need for international financial assistance. The UNFCCC was the first treaty to address human-driven climate change. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, requires higher-income Parties to provide financial resources for developing countries to comply with climate change obligations. The US has provided assistance through various programs to support climate change activities in the developing world. The US has provided assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various programs and international financial institutions like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The UNFCCC establishes a financial mechanism to provide funds to developing country Parties, with the GEF being an official operating entity of this mechanism. The relationship between the UNFCCC and the GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. The US has made significant financial commitments to the GEF, totaling $2.732 billion. In 2009, the COP in Copenhagen noted the Copenhagen Accord, which was later adopted in the Cancun Agreements, including Fast start financing commitments by developed countries. The agreement acknowledges the commitment by developed countries to provide financial resources to address climate finance needs of developing countries, with a $30 billion pledge for 2010-2012 and a goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020. Funds can come from various sources, and the Paris Agreement in 2015 further emphasizes the obligation for developed countries to support developing nations in climate change mitigation efforts. The Paris Agreement emphasizes the mobilization of financial support for developing countries' climate change efforts. Developed countries are urged to lead in providing climate finance, with a goal of $100 billion annually by 2020. President Trump announced the intention to withdraw from the agreement in 2017, with the process completed by November 4, 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC after the 2009 Copenhagen Accord. It operates independently with its own board, trustee, and secretariat, accountable to the Conference of Parties. The fund provides grants and concessional financing to assist developing countries in combating climate change. It is capitalized by financial inputs from developed countries and other sources, and became operational in 2014. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) became operational in 2014 with approximately $10.3 billion pledged for its initial capitalization. The Obama Administration pledged $3 billion over four years, with contributions made in 2016 and 2017. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed to eliminate U.S. funding for the GCF in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments to UN climate change programs. President Trump has criticized the GCF, claiming it would redistribute wealth from the US. Despite the Obama Administration's $1 billion contribution, the Trump Administration's stance on remaining a member of the GCF board is unclear. The future of US engagement with the GCF is under review as part of a broader climate change policy development process. The GCF is not directly tied to the UNFCCC 2020 pledges for climate finance mobilization. The negotiating text clarifies that funds for developing countries can come from various sources, including public, private, bilateral, and multilateral, with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) being one option. The GCF is not expected to solely provide the $100 billion goal, and other sources like development bank instruments, carbon markets, and private capital are crucial. The GCF would complement bilateral climate change assistance, and the GCF board is responsible for managing multilateral aid. The GCF board is tasked with determining complementarity with other U.N. multilateral mechanisms. Future negotiations may impact multilateral choices. U.S. allocations for multilateral assistance are based on congressional guidance. Donor Parties to the GCF, pledges, and disbursements are listed in Table 1. Withdrawal from the PA may have positive and negative implications for the U.S., including fiscal savings. Under the Obama Administration, the U.S. provided about $1 billion annually for climate finance in the developing world. Some critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance in developing countries for climate finance, citing bureaucratic inefficiencies and misuse of funds. Reductions in assistance could redirect funds to other priorities and sustain markets for GHG-intensive products. U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA raises concerns about sovereignty and national interests. Some economists argue that investing in preventing climate-related catastrophes today could be more cost-effective than dealing with the future costs. They suggest that developing countries may find economic efficiencies in adopting new technologies rather than retrofitting existing ones. Reductions in international financial assistance could lead to greater economic inefficiencies and increase the vulnerability of lower-income countries to climate threats. The provision of climate finance, specifically adaptation assistance, may also support humanitarian and security interests, as global climate change could worsen poverty, social tensions, and political institutions in the developing world. The withdrawal from the Paris Agreement could harm the country's interests and global leadership in climate finance, impacting U.S. businesses supporting low-emissions technologies. It may also lead to reduced demand for goods and services, including U.S. exports, and potentially cede international influence to other nations. Despite exiting the agreement, the U.S. remains committed to providing financial resources to developing countries under the UNFCCC. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs could impact international efforts to help developing countries combat climate change. The decision relies on assumptions about program efficiencies and the collective assistance from other nations, regional governments, states, cities, and the private sector. U.S. contributions to developing countries for climate change activities are determined by Congress, which authorizes federal agency programs and appropriations for these initiatives. Congressional committees oversee international climate change assistance programs, providing guidance to agencies and ensuring U.S. interests are represented. Committees include the U.S. House of Representatives Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Appropriations, and the U.S. Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations."
