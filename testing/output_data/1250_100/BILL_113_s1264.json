    "content": "The \"Clean Vehicle Corridors Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that traditional transportation refueling networks face market uncertainties hindering the use of cleaner alternative domestic energy resources. Investor interest in cleaner refueling options is limited by high capital costs and uncertain consumer demand. While reduced emissions and energy independence are important, they are not enough to drive large-scale changes. American-made fuels offer energy security benefits, but imported oil is still widely used in on-road vehicles. Vehicles fueled by cleaner alternatives like natural gas, propane, electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels can be cost-effective over time, but their sales are limited. Facilitating infrastructure development along designated routes will expand cleaner alternative fuel vehicles and increase commercial success by providing refueling stations, attracting more buyers, and creating new market outlets for clean fuel providers. The purpose of facilitating infrastructure development along designated routes is to expand cleaner alternative fuel vehicles, increase commercial success, provide refueling stations, attract more buyers, and create new market outlets for clean fuel providers. The Act aims to provide market certainty for private investment in clean transportation, promote technologies for cleaner fuel options, facilitate incentives for clean transportation vehicles, support job growth, reduce emissions, decrease foreign oil dependence, and encourage innovation in transportation energy. The Act aims to encourage innovation in transportation energy and technology. The Act aims to encourage innovation in transportation energy and technology by defining key terms. The Act defines key terms related to transportation energy and technology, including cleaner alternative fuels like compressed natural gas, electric, and hydrogen, as well as the Clean Cities program managed by the Department of Energy. The term \"supporting infrastructure\" includes fueling stations, rest stops, travel plazas, and service areas located along a Clean Vehicle Corridor, which are critical for trucks on designated national road networks. The Clean Vehicle Corridors Program focuses on supporting infrastructure like fueling stations, rest stops, travel plazas, and service areas along designated national road networks. The Secretary of Transportation must designate at least 5 \"Clean Vehicle Corridors\" along Federal highways within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Before making a designation, consultation with the Secretary of Energy and other relevant agencies is required. The Secretary of Transportation must consult with various government entities and organizations to determine which highways should be designated as Clean Vehicle Corridors. Preference should be given to corridors connecting Clean Cities and consideration should be given to air quality nonattainment areas. Additionally, the Secretary should encourage the addition of cleaner alternative fuel options in infrastructure development. The Secretary may provide waivers to statutory restrictions for cleaner alternative fuel projects and vehicles along Clean Vehicle Corridors, including modifying HOV/HOT lane restrictions and weight limits to accommodate vehicles using cleaner alternative fuels. The Secretary may provide waivers for cleaner alternative fuel projects and vehicles along Clean Vehicle Corridors, including modifying restrictions and weight limits to accommodate vehicles using cleaner alternative fuels. This includes designating parking spaces for these vehicles, including fueling infrastructure projects in State energy conservation plans, and giving areas surrounding Clean Cities additional support. The Secretary of Transportation will maintain a website with information and resources for Clean Vehicle Corridors, including best practices and case studies of successful cleaner alternative fuel programs. Additionally, the Secretary will identify existing technical mechanisms to support these initiatives. The Secretary will collaborate with the Department of Energy and Clean Vehicle Corridor stakeholders to gather data on cleaner alternative fueling station usage patterns. Additionally, the Secretary will establish interstate compacts between contiguous States. Establishment of Clean Vehicle Corridor partnerships through interstate compacts to facilitate planning and siting of necessary facilities. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to these partnerships in collaboration with other federal agencies. No limitations on federal law applicability or authority within the compacts. The establishment of Clean Vehicle Corridor partnerships through interstate compacts allows for planning and siting of facilities. Congress can withdraw consent every 3 years after the compact takes effect."
