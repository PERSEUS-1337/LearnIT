    "content": "The \"Gun Crime Enforcement and Second Amendment Restoration Act of 1996\" aims to protect citizens from armed violent criminals by focusing on arresting, convicting, and incarcerating offenders to prevent them from quickly returning to the streets. The Attorney General must establish an armed violent criminal apprehension program within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Each US attorney must appoint a prosecutor and create a task force to develop strategies for removing armed violent criminals from the streets, considering factors like punishment deterrence, laws, resources, and the nature of the crimes. The Attorney General requires US attorneys to report on violent crime in their districts and the prosecution of certain federal crimes. The Attorney General also submits reports to Congress on this information and waivers granted. US attorneys can request waivers from the Attorney General for certain requirements. The Attorney General may waive requirements for US attorneys based on guidelines considering the number of assistant attorneys and level of violent crime. An \"armed violent criminal\" is defined as someone accused of specific gun-related offenses after a previous violent crime conviction. This section will expire after five years from the enactment of the Act.
