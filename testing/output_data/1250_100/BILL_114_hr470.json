    "content": "The \"Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2015\" allows for the disposal of isolated National Forest System land in Georgia to be sold for public interest. Proceeds will be used by the Forest Service to purchase land for National Forest purposes in the state. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary is authorized to sell or exchange United States' rights in National Forest System land in Georgia. The land subject to sale or exchange consists of 30 tracts totaling 3,841 acres. Maps depicting the land are available for public inspection. The Secretary may modify boundaries based on land management considerations. The Secretary may convey land sold under this Act by quitclaim deed and reserve rights-of-way or other interests for management purposes. Land must be sold for market value determined by appraisal or competitive bid, with consideration paid in cash for sales or exchanges. The Secretary has the authority to accept cash payments exceeding 25% of the land value in exchanges. Land can be sold publicly or privately, with the option to use brokers and pay commissions from sale proceeds. The Secretary can also solicit offers and reject those deemed inadequate or not in the public interest. SEC. 4 of the Act allows the Secretary to deposit sale proceeds into a specific fund for land acquisition in Georgia. The funds are available for use without further appropriation, but cannot be used to acquire land without the owner's written consent."
