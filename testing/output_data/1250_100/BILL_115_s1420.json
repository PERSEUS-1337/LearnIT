    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017\" or the \"LOVE Act of 2017\". During the Lavender Scare in the 1950s and 1960s, over 1,000 Department of State employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. The Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security forced employees out based on their sexual orientation, citing security risks. Many patriotic Americans were also barred from joining the Department due to discriminatory screening processes. Congress played a role in these actions due to investigations into federal employees' \"sex perversion\". Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State reported on the number of homosexuals fired each year due to pressure from Congress. The \"Lavender Scare\" led to wrongful dismissals of over 1,000 employees based on their sexual orientation. In the 1990s, State personnel suspected of being gay were investigated and removed as \"security risks\". Secretary of State Warren Christopher prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1994, and President Clinton signed an Executive Order in 1998 barring such discrimination. Executive Order 13087 banned discrimination based on sexual orientation. Secretary of State John Kerry apologized for the \"Lavender Scare\" and reaffirmed the Department's commitment to diversity and inclusion for all employees, including the LGBTI community. The Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources will review employee terminations since 1950 to identify wrongful terminations based on sexual orientation. A report will be compiled within 270 days, including historical statements on policies that led to such terminations. The Secretary of State will review the consistency of Director General's reviews under section 3 and submit reports to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a Reconciliation Board will be established. The Secretary of State will establish an independent Reconciliation Board within the Office of Civil Rights to review reports on the \"Lavender Scare\" firings. The Board will contact affected employees or their families, offer to change employment records, and provide a point of contact for oral testimony on discrimination and termination experiences. The Reconciliation Board will review claims of discrimination and termination based on sexual orientation, allowing former employees to bring grievances if they believe they were wrongfully terminated. The Board must review each claim within 150 days and the Department of State will provide necessary information. The Board will terminate 5 years after the enactment of the Act. The Reconciliation Board will review claims of discrimination and termination based on sexual orientation, allowing former employees to bring grievances if they believe they were wrongfully terminated. The Board must review each claim within 150 days and the Department of State will provide necessary information. The Board will terminate 5 years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY. Secretary of State Kerry apologized for past discrimination against LGBTI employees at the State Department, acknowledging the historical mistreatment and expressing support for the community. He highlighted efforts to promote LGBTI rights globally, including appointing a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons in 2015. Kerry emphasized the Department's commitment to equality and apologized to those affected by past discriminatory practices. Congress formally apologizes for its role in the \"Lavender Scare\" and similar discriminatory policies at the Department of State, which were influenced by congressional investigations into the sexuality of federal employees. The Secretary of State will establish a permanent exhibit on the \"Lavender Scare\" at the United States Diplomacy Center museum, ensuring the history of this discriminatory episode is not forgotten. The exhibit must be installed within a year, provide access to relevant reports, and display material from oral testimonies. Additionally, guidance on issuing visas will be provided. The Secretary of State will submit a report to Congress on countries not issuing visas to the spouses of Foreign Service personnel due to sexual orientation within 100 days of this Act. Recommendations may include eliminating visa reciprocity with offending countries to ensure all spouses receive visas. Additionally, an Advancement Board will be established. The Secretary of State will establish an Advancement Board within the Department of State to address issues faced by LGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their families. The Board will hear testimony and submit reports to Congress with recommendations to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Advancement Board within the Department of State will have restricted access to only Members of Congress, their staff, and members of the Advancement Board."
