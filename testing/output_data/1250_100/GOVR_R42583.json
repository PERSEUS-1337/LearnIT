    "content": "Since the 1930s, federal job training programs have aimed to help vulnerable youth by providing job training and related services. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 authorizes programs for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. These programs, such as WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, are carried out by the Department of Labor. The federal job training system for youth includes programs like WIA Youth Activities and Job Corps, aimed at connecting youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. Funding for WIA programs continues through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the future. Relevant provisions of two bills, H.R. 803 and S. 1356, are discussed in this report. The federal job training system for youth includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. These programs provide job training, education, and employment services for youth. While WIA's authorization expired in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs. Job Corps is administered separately from the other programs by ETA's Office of Job Corps. The federal job training system for youth includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. These programs aim to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. Each program serves youth with specific barriers, with YouthBuild specifically for high school dropouts. Job Corps provides residential services, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. Each program offers employment and educational services in unique ways. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program provides mentoring, educational, and reentry services for youth returning from secure facilities. Funding for youth programs is allocated by DOL to states, which then distribute funds to local WIBs. Job Corps centers are operated by nonprofit and for-profit organizations through agreements with DOL. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress has been working on reauthorizing WIA, with recent hearings addressing issues related to youth programs. During the 111th and 112th Congress, hearings were held to address issues with the WIA youth programs, including discussions on refining laws, updating WIA to meet changing economic demands, and modernizing job training programs. The House and Senate committees focused on improving the Youth Activities grant program and addressing declining youth employment. The full committee held a hearing on reauthorizing WIA, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297) on April 17, 2012. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was passed by the House on March 15, 2013. In the Senate, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) was introduced on July 24, 2013. The Senate HELP Committee marked up the Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) on July 31, 2013, and ordered the bill reported by a vote of 18 to 3. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth to make them more efficient. Concerns were also raised about potential oversight and coordination challenges if programs were consolidated. Coordination is essential to meet the diverse needs of youth as intended by WIA. Congress and others are interested in the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with a focus on at-risk youth. An impact evaluation of Job Corps has been completed, and a similar evaluation for YouthBuild is underway. Concerns have been raised about eligibility requirements for Youth Activities, with some stating that income criteria may exclude needy youth. There is also debate on the emphasis the program should place on serving older youth. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22-24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the school status of youth in the program and the age eligibility. Congress has considered proposals to fund Job Corps centers and address performance issues. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found overlap in federal workforce programs. The report highlighted similarities between youth workforce programs but noted differences in how services are carried out. GAO recommended consolidating administration of selected workforce programs, including the Employment Service and training services under TANF. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs, including those for youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund. The bill aims to consolidate various workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities. Required activities include providing \"work ready services\" such as assessment, job search assistance, career planning, and case management. States would receive funding based on factors like disadvantaged youth population, with a portion set aside for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment. The bill establishes a competitive grant program under the Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) for individuals with barriers to employment, including at-risk youth ages 16-24. States can award grants to provide employment and training services, focusing on education, credentials, and employment experience in in-demand industries. The bill defines \"at-risk youth\" as ages 16-24 who are low-income, high school dropouts, in foster care, offenders, disabled, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Concerns raised about the proposed Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) include potential reduced youth services due to lack of dedicated funding. S. 1356 maintains youth programs and introduces Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) for states and localities to improve education and employment outcomes for youth. One-stop centers aim to connect youth to job training and employment services, even if they are not eligible for specific programs. These centers face challenges in attracting youth, with some areas relying on referrals from schools or service providers. Various methods are used to attract youth to the centers, such as actively recruiting, placing youth program staff at the one-stop, training staff in youth programs, and making the facility more appealing to youth. One-stop centers are encouraged to target youth by providing funding for local projects and guidance on enhancing youth connections. Methods include co-locating youth program staff, cross-training staff, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" Legislation requires states to continue funding one-stop centers for job search assistance, but does not specify youth services. The bills do not address the extent to which youth would be served at these centers. Each local Workforce Investment Board (WIB) has a youth council responsible for developing parts of the local workforce plan related to eligible youth. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges with some youth councils developing beyond advisory roles to their WIBs. The report highlighted challenges faced by some councils in engaging youth and parents due to transportation issues and conflicting schedules. It identified enabling conditions for successful youth councils, including the presence of an established intermediary organization, strong school-to-career partnerships, and a community-wide planning process. Stakeholders recommended giving youth councils more flexibility in partnerships and priorities. Stakeholders recommend that youth councils develop a comprehensive plan to coordinate activities and funding streams. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional, with a focus on addressing the needs of vulnerable youth. Local workforce investment boards may need to have representatives with youth interests, while state boards must have youth representatives. S. 1356 proposes changing local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards, requiring them to establish standing committees for youth services. The bill aims to address issues related to providing youth services through community-based organizations with a successful track record. It suggests allowing existing entities to fulfill requirements for standing committees. Coordination between the workforce and education systems is a concern, with recommendations for better linkages between youth programs and educational agencies. Some stakeholders suggest that greater coordination between workforce and education systems can help meet the needs of youth under the Youth Activities program. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted areas where improvements are needed in collaboration between these systems, particularly in contracting entities to provide services to youth. Education entities in some locations were hesitant to partner, citing concerns about the alignment of WIA's vision with schools' missions. The collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education aims to ensure that all youth, whether in-school or out-of-school, receive necessary services and support. This includes past initiatives like the School-to-Work program, which provided grants for work-based learning and job training programs. Congress could learn from the success of the STW program in improving youth development services. The STW program provided work-based learning and job training for youth. H.R. 803 and S. 1356 aim to coordinate workforce and education systems through local plans and Unified State Plans. The State Plan (USF) is submitted every four years to the Secretaries of Labor and Education, covering various programs authorized under Titles I and II of WIA. This includes the Youth Activities program, Adult Activities program, Dislocated Workers program, adult education programs, Employment Service, and vocational rehabilitation program. The plan must analyze state economic conditions, describe the state's vision and goals for workforce preparation, and address concerns about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA. The three programs under WIA have met or exceeded their goals set by the Department of Labor. Evaluations are required to assess program effectiveness and cost. Limited information exists on program effectiveness, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Reauthorization legislation may require more frequent independent evaluations of WIA programs. The GAO report identified five programs, none of which were youth programs authorized under WIA. Limited information on program impacts may hinder policy makers' ability to assess effectiveness. A social science research organization is conducting an impact evaluation of YouthBuild, with initial results expected in 2015. The Job Corps program underwent a process evaluation to assess center practices related to job placement, post-program earnings, and education/training attainment. Factors linked to strong performance included robust student support, staff accountability, and partner relationships. The program was last rigorously evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s for its impact on youth aged 16-24. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s for its impact on youth aged 16-24, showing positive outcomes in education and employment. A follow-up study found that while the positive effects diminished over time, older youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application saw increased earnings. Performance measures for Job Corps, Youth Activities, and YouthBuild programs are specified in the WIA. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, proposes new performance measures for individuals participating in activities funded under the Workforce Investment Fund. These measures include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, earnings growth, attainment of credentials, and participation in education or training programs. S. 1356 establishes performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention, earnings, credential attainment, skills gains, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may add more indicators, and Job Corps operators must follow these measures. Section 136 of WIA outlines state and local performance measures for the Youth Activities program. The Youth Activities program under WIA establishes performance indicators for eligible youth, including basic skills attainment, diplomas, postsecondary education or employment for ages 14-18, and entry into employment, retention, earnings, and credential attainment for ages 19-21. States negotiate with DOL to set performance levels for these core indicators. Performance measures for the Youth Activities program under WIA are determined through negotiation between states and DOL. Stakeholders have raised concerns that these measures may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to focus on higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. Some programs only accept youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement, which may unintentionally exclude lower-skilled youth. In response, DOL issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist the most in need while still meeting performance goals. The 2010 DOL guidance aimed to help service providers serve at-risk youth effectively while meeting performance goals. It focused on strategies like multiyear contracting, using real-time indicators for provider assessment, factoring participant characteristics into goal negotiations, creating positive incentives for enrolling needy youth, and promoting interagency collaboration. The guidance also suggested that common measures could provide flexibility for working with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Suggestions include adjusting performance levels for serving higher-risk groups and looking at JTPA for insights on adjusting standards for needy youth populations. Governors adjusted service delivery area standards based on economic and demographic factors under JTPA. The process aimed to level the playing field across different areas, using DOL adjustment models or state-approved approaches. WIA requires Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including outcomes like entered employment and retention in postsecondary education. DOL has implemented 33 additional performance metrics based on GPRA requirements. The DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about Job Corps' implementation of performance metrics, including inaccurate reporting, lack of established targets, and miscalculated costs. WIA requires YouthBuild program applicants to include descriptions of results for common performance indicators. YouthBuild's final regulation addresses performance indicators such as employment or education placement, degree attainment, and literacy gains. The DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about Job Corps' implementation of performance metrics, including inaccurate reporting, lack of established targets, and miscalculated costs. WIA requires YouthBuild program applicants to include descriptions of results for common performance indicators such as employment or education placement, degree attainment, and literacy gains. DOL has issued guidance to grantees on performance indicators, including retention and recidivism rates for the YouthBuild program. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would need strategies to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth ages 16-24. Eligibility for the Youth Activities formula program includes being age 14-21, low-income, and facing barriers like basic literacy deficiency or homelessness. Discussions revolve around the level of proof required for youth in the WIA Youth program. The WIA Youth program faces challenges in verifying youth eligibility for low-income status, as many struggle to provide required documentation like income proof. This process diverts resources from service delivery. State and local officials noted difficulties in implementing the program, potentially excluding needy youth due to income eligibility requirements. The WIA Youth program encounters challenges in verifying eligibility for low-income status, as youth may struggle to provide required documentation. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria, but DOL cannot waive participant eligibility requirements. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, but it is unclear if they have adjusted their guidelines for greater flexibility. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the lack of flexibility in documenting income and eligibility factors under WIA. Some suggest using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, JTPA, including criteria based on participation in federal programs for low-income individuals. Other proposals include adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty areas or specific groups of at-risk youth. The goal of WIA is to serve at-risk youth, including dropouts, foster care youth, homeless/runaway youth, and those not in school or working. There are discussions on changing eligibility requirements to include means-tested programs or specific risk factors. Stakeholders question if the Youth Activities program should focus more on out-of-school youth, as challenges exist in recruiting and retaining them despite the 30% funding requirement. Despite the goal of WIA to serve at-risk youth, challenges persist in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth due to higher costs and difficulties in maintaining contact. Suggestions have been made to allocate more funding to dropouts and high-risk in-school youth. Previous legislation proposed prioritizing out-of-school youth, while others advocate for maintaining current funding levels but increasing technical assistance to states and localities. The Department of Labor (DOL) has provided guidance to states and localities on serving out-of-school youth and at-risk in-school youth. DOL recommended strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth, funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants, and implemented a system to reconnect dropouts to education pathways. A 2004 report highlighted successful strategies in serving out-of-school youth, such as providing technical assistance through a training network. Minnesota provided resources for out-of-school youth, including articles, guides, and Job Corps strategies. Some local areas contracted with service providers for GED programs and vocational training. The age limit for WIA Youth services was expanded to 24 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to reach more unemployed young adults. Research suggests a longer transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage and higher living costs. The transition to adulthood for vulnerable youth populations is complicated by challenges such as family conflict, unemployment, and lack of education. Older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school. There is a debate on whether the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) should target older disconnected youth. Expanding the age limit for youth services under WIA could strain resources but may attract more youth to seek services. The Department of Labor (DOL) has advised on workforce programs under WIA. The Department of Labor (DOL) has advised that older youth can be co-enrolled in both the Youth Activities program and Adult Activities program under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet their individual needs. There is an increase in older youth ages 19 to 21 participating in the Youth program, compared to those in the Adult program. The Youth program offers academic services like tutoring and secondary school options, leadership development, and community service activities. In contrast, the Adult program focuses on job search assistance, workplace training, and related instruction. Both programs provide occupational skills training and employment links, with more training opportunities available in the Adult program. The Youth program offers academic services like tutoring, leadership development, and community service activities, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and workplace training. The Youth program provides supportive services such as child care and transportation, adult mentoring, and counseling, including drug and alcohol abuse counseling. The Adult program primarily focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase. DOL published a request for comment on its methodology for selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing certain centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance. The closures would be based on performance criteria and budget constraints. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve low-performing centers and close those that do not improve. The comment period ended in February 2013, with no further information provided by DOL as of February 2014. The bill H.R. 803 proposes new performance measures for Job Corps centers, including a program improvement plan for low-performing centers and provisions to close centers that do not improve. The DOL Secretary would conduct an audit ranking centers based on performance and incidents of violence, with the bottom 25 centers to be closed within 12 months of enactment. Similar proposals have been suggested in previous Congresses, such as the Reagan Administration's plan to close or reduce the capacity of Job Corps centers. The proposal to close Job Corps centers or reduce program capacity by half to improve efficiency was considered by the DOL, but ultimately the centers were not closed. Legislation in the 104th Congress aimed to close 25 underperforming centers based on various criteria. There was also a proposal to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to states, but some objected due to concerns about potential decreases in student attendance or funding shifts. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures and establish performance metrics for the Youth Activities program. It aims to improve efficiency and performance within a one-year period. The common measures are performance metrics developed by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) for workforce programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. Introduced in 2003, these measures include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy and numeracy gains. ETA has issued additional policy guidance on these measures, emphasizing that they do not replace existing statutory reporting requirements for WIA programs. The common measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Goals for the common measures are set ambitiously and may be adjusted for individual grantees. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. The regression model for Youth Activities sets targets based on program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics to correct for the effects of the business cycle. Performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are also based on regression analysis. Each program met or exceeded goals in PY2011 and PY2012, with placement in employment or education being a key measure of success. The Youth Activities program sets performance targets based on program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate measures the share of youth participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after the exit quarter. Literacy or Numeracy Gains assess the educational progress of youth not in school. The measure of Literacy or Numeracy Gains in the Youth Activities program assesses the educational progress of out-of-school youth who increase their functional levels in reading, writing, and math. Participants are tested before and during the program to track their improvement, excluding those who are not deficient in basic skills to focus on remediation for those in need. The Department of Labor (DOL) provides guidance on testing for literacy and numeracy gains in the Youth Activities program, including accommodations for students with disabilities."
