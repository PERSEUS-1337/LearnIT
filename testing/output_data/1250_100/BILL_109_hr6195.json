The Congress finds that the National Science Foundation plays a crucial role in strengthening the nation's information infrastructure, supporting research for automation and digitization, and ensuring industry readiness for advanced technology. Information management is projected to grow significantly by 2010, highlighting the need for a systematic plan to transition the workforce to the information age. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms like \"Director\" referring to the Director of the National Science Foundation, \"information\" related to digital data in sectors with government involvement, and \"institution of higher education\" as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, awards grants for research on improving information systems in areas like information studies, population informatics, and data security. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2008-2011. Additionally, the Director awards Informatics Research Centers in collaboration with other agencies. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with the purpose of generating innovative approaches in information through cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research. Institutions may partner with government laboratories, for-profit, or nonprofit institutions. Applications for funding must be submitted to the Director following specified requirements. The application for funding a Center for Informatics Research must include a description of research projects, promote collaboration among professionals from different disciplines, and contribute to increasing the number of information researchers. The Director will evaluate applications based on the ability to generate innovative approaches to information and effectively carry out the research program. The Director evaluates applications for funding a Center for Informatics Research based on the applicant's research experience, ability to foster collaborations, support students, and partner with government or private entities. An annual meeting is convened to promote collaboration between Center participants. Authorization of appropriations includes $4,500,000 for fiscal year 2008. The funding for the Center for Informatics Research is as follows: $4,500,000 for fiscal year 2008, $4,600,000 for fiscal year 2009, $4,700,000 for fiscal year 2010, and $4,800,000 for fiscal year 2011. SEC. 5. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION INFORMATION PROGRAMS. The Director will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide industry experience, and use distance learning. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition, and funds will enhance the quality of information education and recruit more students. The program aims to enhance undergraduate and master's degree information programs by developing curriculum, establishing degree programs, creating research opportunities for students, acquiring necessary equipment, facilitating faculty collaborations, and partnering with other academic institutions. The program aims to enhance undergraduate and master's degree information programs by developing curriculum, establishing degree programs, creating research opportunities for students, acquiring necessary equipment, facilitating faculty collaborations, and partnering with other academic institutions. This includes establishing student internships at various government agencies, private industry, and nonprofit institutions, enhancing bridge programs between community colleges and universities, and other activities determined by the Director in consultation with other Federal agencies. Institutions seeking funding must submit an application with specified requirements. The applicant must provide a description of their research and instructional capacity, a plan to build instructional capacity in information fields, collaborations with government agencies or private industry, student enrollment and placement data, and a plan to evaluate program success. The applicant must provide a plan to evaluate the success of the proposed program, including postgraduate assessment of graduate school and job placement rates. The Director will ensure grants are awarded in various geographic areas and types of institutions. An evaluation of the program will be conducted within 3 years to assess the increase in students pursuing degrees in information fields. The Director will provide grants for improving education in information fields. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation is specified for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. The Director will provide grants for improving education in information fields with authorized appropriations of $7,200,000 for fiscal year 2009, $7,400,000 for fiscal year 2010, and $7,600,000 for fiscal year 2011. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will report to Congress on efforts related to informatics, including standards harmonization and support for digitization. The report will include timetables for information standards, challenges in promulgation, ensuring usability for scientists, and actions to ensure robust and timely standards."
