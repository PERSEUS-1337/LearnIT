    "content": "In 1891, Congress granted the President the authority to establish forest reserves from the public domain. Six years later, Congress stated that the reserves were to improve and protect the forest, secure water flows, and provide timber for US citizens. The reserves were initially administered by the Division of Forestry in the General Land Office, then transferred to the USDA Bureau of Forestry (Forest Service) in 1905. President Theodore Roosevelt expanded the reserves in 1906 and 1907, leading Congress to limit the President's authority to add to the system in certain states. Congress limited the President's authority to add to the forest reserves system in certain states in 1907. The Weeks Act in 1911 allowed for additions to the National Forest System (NFS) through the purchase of private lands. Presidential authority to proclaim new national forests was ended in 1976. The NFS has grown slowly from 154 million acres in 1919 to 193 million acres in 2014 through purchases, donations, and land transfers. It consists of 154 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and 108 other areas. Each national forest unit is managed by a forest supervisor, organized into nine administrative regions headed by regional foresters. The National Forest System (NFS) is managed by a chief who reports to the USDA Secretary. NFS regions are identified by number and are concentrated in the western regions. Inholdings, private lands within national forest boundaries, can pose challenges for land management. The management goals for national forests were established in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 establishes the policy that national forests are for outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. It directs land management for multiple uses that best meet the needs of the American people, emphasizing sustained yield without impairing land productivity. Other statutes like NEPA and the Endangered Species Act also apply to federal agencies. Federal agencies must adhere to various statutes such as NEPA and ESA. FS planning is primarily guided by RPA and NFMA, promoting foresight in forest resource use and establishing long-term management plans for NFS units. RPA assessments are conducted every 10 years to report resource status and trends. NFMA requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each NFS unit, revised every 10-15 years to address changing conditions and public use, using an interdisciplinary approach with public involvement and NEPA compliance. The planning rules for forest management have been revised multiple times since the 1970s, with each presidential administration making changes. The Clinton Administration's 2000 regulations aimed to prioritize ecological sustainability, but the Bush Administration replaced them in 2005 with rules balancing ecological, economic, and social factors. These rules exempted NFMA plans from NEPA and ESA, leading to legal challenges over reduced environmental protection and lack of public input. The 2012 planning rule established by the Obama Administration emphasizes ecological sustainability, landscape-scale restoration, and science-based decisions informed by public values. It includes a three-phase planning framework and accounts for potential impacts of climate change. However, logging, ranching, and off-highway vehicle groups have filed lawsuits challenging the ecological sustainability provisions. The Forest Service has developed 125 plans for managing national forests and grasslands, with 60 plans revised as of FY2015. The National Forest Service administers lands for multiple uses including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife, and fish purposes. The uses are to be balanced to meet the needs of the American people while maintaining high-level output without impairing land productivity. Revenue generated from national forest uses can offset agency costs, benefit communities, or be deposited into the General Treasury. In FY2014, the Forest Service generated $242.2 million in revenue, with recreation being the largest source. Timber production, salvage sales, and KV sales also contributed significantly to revenue. Initially, the agency aimed to be self-supporting through timber production, but significant timber sales only began in the 1950s due to post-WWII housing demand and decreased competition from private sales. The wood products industry, selling 10-12 billion board feet of timber annually, has seen a decline in harvest levels since the 1990s due to various factors. Despite a slight upward trend in recent years, the price of lumber dropped significantly in FY2005, impacting the value of FS harvests. In FY2015, the FS harvested 2.5 billion board feet of timber, the largest production since FY2000, generating $162.7 million in revenue. The FS harvested 2.5 billion board feet of timber in FY2015, the largest production since FY2000, generating $162.7 million. Timber harvests are used for land and resource management objectives, including ecosystem enhancement and watershed conditions. Stewardship contracts with private parties offset some costs, and salvage harvesting is done to facilitate forest restoration and generate revenue. Outdoor recreation is popular in national forests, with over 166 million annual visits for various activities. Recreational activities like skiing, snowboarding, and horseback riding are popular in national forests. Private companies offer additional recreational opportunities through special use authorizations. Controversy surrounds activities like off-highway vehicle and snowmobile use. The Forest Service is managing these activities through a travel management planning process. Recreation on national forest lands generates significant revenue, with receipts totaling $72.0 million in FY2014. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act established a recreation fee program for the Forest Service. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act established a recreation fee program for the Forest Service, which was extended until September 30, 2016. Congress may consider allowing the program to sunset or extending it with modifications. The National Forest System contains important ecological, recreational, economic, and cultural resources, including fishable streams, wildlife habitats, and endangered species. The Forest Service issues permits and leases for recreational activities on national forest lands. The Forest Service issues permits and leases for grazing private livestock on approximately 93 million acres of NFS lands, with fees charged under a formula established by law. The federal grazing fees for 2016 will be $2.11 per head month, and BLM lands provide more grazing than national forests. Protecting watershed health is a key purpose of national forests, with nearly one-fifth of the nation's water originating on NFS lands. The Forest Service focuses on protecting watershed health by assessing and prioritizing conditions of watersheds on NFS lands. Watershed action plans are developed to guide restoration activities, with improvements seen in the condition class of 30 watersheds since FY2012. Restoration activities include decommissioning roads and enhancing stream habitat. Congress has created special designations for certain areas within the NFS, such as wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and national trails. The NFS includes various types of specially designated areas with restrictions on resource development. Management of FS roadless areas, totaling 58.5 million acres, remains controversial, with debates on wilderness protection. President Clinton's roadless rule, prohibiting road construction and timber harvesting, is still in effect after legal challenges. The Court refused to review a lower court's decisions in 2012 regarding the use of NFS lands for various purposes such as electricity transmission, telecommunication sites, and commercial filming. Special use authorizations (SUAs) establish terms for NFS land use, including mineral and energy exploration. Approximately 5.6 million acres of NFS lands are leased for oil, gas, coal, and geothermal operations, with 4,200 federal oil and gas wells and coal production accounting for 25% of the nation's total. The FS administers 160,000 mining claims, with receipts collected by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue collects data on mineral activities. In 2016, a moratorium was placed on new coal leases on federal lands while potential reforms are evaluated. Renewable energy projects like solar and wind are allowed on NFS lands through right-of-way SUAs. FS has approved a wind power facility SUA but not for solar projects. Discussions on FS management focus on catastrophic wildfires, with recent fire seasons being some of the worst since 1960. Fires are believed to be exacerbated by degraded forest conditions and drought. The Forest Service advocates for rapid action to improve forest resilience, including prescribed burning and thinning, to protect forests and homes from wildfires. Critics argue that reducing fuel levels is adequate, but treatments that remove commercial timber may degrade forest health and waste taxpayer dollars. The FS receives both discretionary and mandatory appropriations, allowing it to spend money without further action by Congress. In FY2016, the Forest Service received $7.06 billion in total funding, with $6.36 billion (90%) as discretionary funds and $691.91 million (10%) as mandatory funds. The National Forest System is primarily funded through discretionary accounts, with Congress appropriating $1.51 billion in FY2016. Funding is allocated among various subaccounts and regions, allowing for management of activities on national forests. The National Forest System is funded through discretionary accounts, with Congress appropriating $1.51 billion in FY2016. Funds are allocated to regions and programs, then further distributed to each national forest. The largest subaccount is Forest Products, funding the Timber Sale program. Other subaccounts include Land Management Planning and Inventory and Monitoring, supporting various forest management activities. The National Forest System is funded through discretionary accounts, with Congress appropriating $1.51 billion in FY2016. Funds are allocated to regions and programs, then further distributed to each national forest. Forest Products funds activities related to timber sales, stewardship contracts, and special forest products permits on NFS lands. Grazing Management funds the administration of livestock grazing use permits on the NFS. Vegetation and Watershed Management funds restoration-related activities to improve forest and rangeland conditions, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Wildlife and Fish Habitat Management funds activities to restore and maintain wildlife and fish habitats on NFS lands. The NFS account receives funding from various sources, including the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program Fund, Minerals and Geology Management, Landownership Management, and Law Enforcement Operations. These funds support activities such as landscape restoration projects, mineral operations, land management, and law enforcement on NFS lands. The FS proposed a new budget structure for the NFS account to combine its restoration-focused efforts. The FS proposed a new budget structure for the NFS account by combining restoration-focused work into one budget line item, Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR), in FY2011. The IRR proposal combined various management activities into one budget line item, but Congress did not enact the FY2011 proposal. In FY2012, Congress authorized up to $68 million for the IRR pilot program in three regions. The pilot program began late in FY2012 and has been authorized through FY2016. Congress may consider implementing the IRR across the NFS. The Integrated Resources Restoration (IRR) program was proposed by the FS in FY2011 but was not enacted by Congress. In FY2012, Congress authorized a $68 million pilot program for IRR in three regions, which has been extended through FY2016. Proponents argue that IRR provides budgetary flexibility for land and resource management to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest resilience. Critics are concerned about decreased congressional oversight. The FS receives appropriations for wildfire management activities through the Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund, totaling over half of their discretionary budget in recent years. In FY2016, the FS received $3.9 billion for WFM and FLAME, including a $700 million supplemental appropriation. The FLAME appropriations included a $700 million supplemental appropriation to cover the high costs of the FY2015 wildfire season. Suppression activities make up a large portion of the regular WFM appropriation, with preparedness and hazardous fuels receiving the bulk of the remaining funds. The FS is authorized to transfer money from other accounts for fire control activities, and may receive additional funding through emergency appropriations if needed. Congress appropriated $700 million in FY2016 to cover wildfire costs. Congress has expressed concerns about the cost of wildfire management, specifically suppression activities, and the impact of fire transfers on other NFS management activities. Options for financing suppression activities have been considered, including proposals to provide funds outside of statutory constraints. The President was authorized in 1891 to reserve lands as forest reserves, with many modifications to NFS boundaries and names since then. Establishing a new national forest or modifying existing boundaries now requires an act of Congress. The Secretary of Agriculture has authorities to add lands to the NFS, with acquisitions often restricted to land. The Secretary of Agriculture has various authorities to acquire lands for the National Forest System (NFS), including the Weeks Act of 1911 and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937. These laws allow for the purchase of forested, cut-over, or denuded lands within watersheds of navigable streams and submarginal lands not suitable for cultivation. Other laws authorize land acquisition for specific purposes, such as access corridors to national forest lands. Additionally, there are authorities for the disposal or conveyance of national forest land out of federal ownership, although these are rarely used.

These laws allow for the purchase of forested, cut-over, or denuded lands within watersheds of navigable streams and submarginal lands not suitable for cultivation. Other laws authorize land acquisition for specific purposes, such as access corridors to national forest lands. The 1897 Organic Act and the 1911 Weeks Act authorize the disposal of land better suited for other uses, such as agriculture or mining. Additional authorities include the 1958 Townsites Act, the 1983 Small Tracts Act, and Congress authorizing the transfer of NFS land for educational purposes. Current debates focus on land and resource allocation and valuation. The management and administration of the National Forest System (NFS) have become more complex and contentious due to increasing demands for land and resource allocation. Controversies often stem from questions about the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. Congress has given the Forest Service considerable discretion in making these decisions, leading to debates on how to achieve multiple use and sustained yield in forest management. Conflicts arise as users and land managers attempt to balance multiple uses and services and produce a sustained yield of resources from the national forests. Congress considers legislation to prioritize various national forests uses or to define levels of production, such as timber production or recreation. Ongoing concerns include wildfire management costs, strategies, and impacts on quality of life and the economy. The increasing costs of wildfire management are impacting national forest programs and resources, with funds and personnel being redirected to fire control. The sustainability of this cost escalation remains uncertain."
