    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act\" and defines terms like \"Federal land\" and \"Henderson redevelopment agency.\" It also references the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 for definitions of hazardous substances, pollutants, and remedies. The Three Kids Mine Project Area, encompassing approximately 1,262 acres of land, is designated for assessment, remediation, and redevelopment by a Responsible Party approved by the State of Nevada. The Secretary of the Interior is involved in the process, and a land conveyance is to occur within 90 days of meeting specified conditions. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency will acquire the Federal land after meeting specified conditions and paying fair market value determined by an appraisal conducted according to national standards. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency will acquire Federal land at fair market value determined by an appraisal conducted according to national standards, including the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. The appraisal will not consider any historical mining contamination. The Secretary will estimate costs for assessing, remediating, and reclaiming the Three Kids Mine Project Site. The Phase II environmental site assessment for the Three Kids Mine Project Site must be based on a comprehensive report approved by the State and prepared according to ASTM International Standard E-2137-06. The Phase II environmental site assessment for the Three Kids Mine Project Site must adhere to ASTM International Standards E-1527-05 and E-1903-11.

If there is a disagreement, experts will be jointly selected to assist in making the final cost estimate. The Secretary will begin the appraisal and cost estimates within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency or Responsible Party will reimburse appraisal costs. The fair market value of Federal land will be adjusted based on estimated remediation and reclamation costs. The conveyance of land is contingent on the execution of a mine remediation and reclamation agreement. The mine remediation and reclamation agreement required under subparagraph (A) shall be an enforceable consent order or agreement between the State and the Responsible Party, obligating the Responsible Party to perform necessary remediation work at the Three Kids Mine Project Site to protect human health and the environment. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency and the State have determined necessary provisions for financial assurance to ensure mine remediation completion. The Agency must notify the Secretary within 90 days of readiness to accept conveyance of Federal land. The Federal land is withdrawn from various activities for a 10-year period after conveyance. The geothermal leasing laws are relinquished for Federal land no longer needed by the Bureau of Reclamation. Existing rights holders can continue to use water conveyance infrastructure on the land. Adjustments to ACEC boundaries are allowed. The ACEC boundary of the River Mountains Area is adjusted to exclude the Three Kids Mine Project Site. Responsibilities for mine remediation and reclamation will apply to the Responsible Party and the State of Nevada after conveyance. The Secretary retains the responsibility for additional response actions if terms of the agreement are not met. SEC. 7. SOUTHERN NEVADA PUBLIC LANDS MANAGEMENT ACT does not apply to land conveyed under this Act, unless it affects compliance with environmental or public health laws or the authority of the United States to enforce such laws.
