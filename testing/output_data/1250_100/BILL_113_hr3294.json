    "content": "The \"State-Run Federal Lands Act\" defines qualifying federal land and the Secretary concerned, allowing states to petition for management of certain federal lands. States can submit a petition to the Secretary concerned to manage certain qualifying Federal lands under a cooperative agreement. The Secretary must approve or deny the petition within 90 days, considering factors like funding availability and completeness of the proposal. If a petition to manage Federal lands under a cooperative agreement is denied, the State must be provided with written notice stating reasons for denial and any deficiencies. The State can then resubmit a corrected petition. If the Secretary does not approve or deny the petition, it is deemed approved. If the Secretary does not approve or deny a petition within 90 days, it is deemed approved. The petition must include a letter from the Governor, a map of qualifying Federal lands, a proposed cooperative agreement, proof of funding, and any other required documentation. The cooperative agreement should state that the State will manage certain Federal lands. The State must provide at least 50% of the total management costs for Federal lands, determined by the Governor and Secretary after a cost assessment. In case of a natural disaster, the State takes over recovery efforts, overriding Federal protocols. The State and Federal entities share the cost of damages to structures on qualifying Federal lands. The State assumes the cost and administration of repairing damages from natural disasters. Revenue from the lands is distributed according to a cost-sharing agreement. The transition from Federal to State management follows specific procedures. The transition from Federal to State management of qualifying Federal lands includes guarantees for Federal employees, the State's use of funds for hiring staff, and authority directed by the petitioning State. Special use permits issued to the Secretary concerned are also transferred. The transition from Federal to State management of qualifying Federal lands includes guarantees for Federal employees, the State's use of funds for hiring staff, and authority directed by the petitioning State. Special use permits issued to the Secretary concerned are also transferred. State laws supersede Federal laws on qualifying Federal lands under a cooperative agreement, and ownership is retained by the State. Federal laws dictate that the United States retains ownership of qualified Federal lands under cooperative agreements. The agreements can be terminated if the state defaults on payments, breaches the agreement, or intentionally petitions for termination. The Secretary concerned must decide whether to approve or deny a petition within 90 days of receiving it, showing a credible reason for the intent."
