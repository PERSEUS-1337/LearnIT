    "content": "This report focuses on child survival and maternal health programs conducted by USAID from FY2001 to FY2008. UNICEF reported a 60% drop in under-five mortality since 1960, but daily deaths among children under five remain high. Most childhood deaths occur before age five, with 37% occurring in the neonatal period. Child deaths in developing countries, especially in Africa, are mainly caused by neonatal infections and five infectious diseases. Undernutrition is a significant factor in these deaths. Monitoring maternal and child health is crucial as it reflects overall health conditions. The Millennium Development Goals aim to reduce child and maternal mortality by two-thirds, but progress is hindered by challenges in other MDGs like undernourishment and lack of clean water access. Undernourished women and children in developing countries face higher maternal and child mortality rates, as well as increased susceptibility to infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. UNICEF reports that 62 countries, mostly in Africa, are not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival. Maternal health and child survival are closely linked, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Access to adequate diets, safe water, sanitation, literacy, and healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth could prevent most of these deaths. Maternal mortality is a significant issue, with 20% of deaths linked to undernutrition and 75% caused by obstetric complications. Young mothers under 20 face higher risks, including pregnancy-related complications and delivering low birth weight babies. Adolescents aged 15-19 are at a higher risk of death during childbirth, with 15 million infants born to adolescents annually. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties. Maternal mortality rates vary by region, with hemorrhage being a significant cause of death in Africa and Asia. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 99% in industrialized nations. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. In 80% of priority countries with high maternal and child deaths, health workforce densities are below the critical threshold for improving health conditions. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum standard. Child and maternal survival rates are higher where there are enough health workers, clean water, controlled mosquito populations, and access to nutritious food. Southeast Asia has the greatest shortage of health workers in absolute terms, while sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest proportional shortage. WHO estimates that globally, 57 countries have critical shortages of health workers, with 36 in Africa. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed worldwide, with African countries needing to increase their health workforce by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold. The U.S. Agency for International Development has committed over $6 billion in support of global child survival efforts, with a significant portion allocated to addressing key health issues. USAID research from the 1970s and 1980s has led to interventions saving millions of children. Recognizing that six health problems cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries, USAID aims to improve child and maternal health. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that the majority of children who die each year do so because of hunger and malnutrition weakening their immune systems. Studies show that undernourished children are more likely to die from infectious diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition impairs the immune system, making children more susceptible to illnesses. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient support to address these issues. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, infant and young child feeding (IYCF), and research on biofortified crops. These programs aim to improve the immune system by adding vital nutrients like zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. USAID estimates that poor feeding practices in the first two years of life contribute to two-thirds of malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. Less than one third of infants are exclusively breastfed during the first six months, leading to early introduction of foods that may lack proper nutrition. USAID supports nutrition programs focusing on micronutrient supplementation, infant and young child feeding, and research on biofortified crops. They emphasize the importance of exclusively breastfeeding infants for better health outcomes, including reduced childhood diseases and mortality. USAID also integrates safe infant feeding practices with HIV/AIDS prevention programs. UNICEF highlights the importance of minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. Additionally, children should receive full immunizations against infections that can cause pneumonia. Since the mid-1990s, international health organizations have focused on expanding access to vaccines to protect children from pneumonia, caused by various pathogens like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. USAID has supported immunizations for nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia since 2002. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, developed by UNICEF and WHO with USAID support, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. Malaria remains a significant threat, with over 500 million severe cases annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed in 2005 to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the CDC. PMI reached over 6 million people in its first year and over 25 million within two years, including indoor residual spraying in 10 countries benefiting more than 17 million people. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) has benefitted over 17 million people by distributing millions of insecticide-treated nets, malarial treatments, and training health workers. HIV/AIDS prevention efforts focus on reducing mother-to-child transmission, with successful interventions lowering the risk to 2%. Nevirapine, a key drug in preventing transmission, costs between $0.29 and $0.40 per dose. Nevirapine syrup is administered to infants within 72 hours of birth to prevent HIV transmission. Early diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are crucial for children due to the faster progression of the disease. The cost of ART for children is higher than for adults, with fixed-dosed treatments being most effective. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, reducing the cost to $0.16 per day or $60 per year. ART is not the only treatment to reduce child mortality among HIV-positive children, as treating opportunistic infections like pneumonia can also help. Since 1986, USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia in HIV-positive children, reduces mortality by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children who need the drug are receiving it. Through PEPFAR, agencies have provided $289.2 million to care for 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, reaching 332,000 OVC with food and nutrition programs. Through PEPFAR, $1.5 billion has been committed for care and support programs for people living with HIV/AIDS. Pediatric treatment received $191.5 million in funding for 85,900 children, while PMTCT services supported over 10 million pregnancies, preventing 157,000 infant HIV infections. Research by UNICEF, WHO, and USAID found that diarrhea can be prevented and treated with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) and fluids, along with breastfeeding. USAID supports the treatment of child diarrhea with ORS, breastfeeding, and hygiene practices. Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhea prevalence by 42% to 46%, but it is not common in poorer communities. In some areas, only a small percentage of mothers use soap for handwashing. India, 13% of mothers use soap after cleaning a child and 20% after defecating outside. USAID supports handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea by 30% to 40%. WHO states measles immunization is cost-effective, saving more lives per unit cost than other interventions. Measles vaccine costs less than $1 per dose and can be bundled with rubella or mumps vaccines for about $0.65 to $1.50 per dose when bought through UNICEF. UNICEF reports that a MR vaccine costs about $0.65 per bundled dose, and MMR costs about $1.04 to $1.50 per bundled dose. Global measles mortality decreased by 68% between 2000 and 2006, with the largest gains in Africa where measles cases and deaths fell by 91%. USAID-supported immunization programs focus on training health workers and improving service delivery in over 100 countries. USAID partners with organizations like GAVI, the Vaccine Fund, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to enhance countries' vaccine administration capacity. Their maternal health programs aim to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings through various interventions, including nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. USAID advocates for skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care planning for home deliveries. They train birth attendants to prevent infant deaths and promote hygienic practices. Community-based interventions focus on recognizing birth complications and knowing where to seek help. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by training birth attendants to manage postpartum hemorrhage, which accounts for 32% of maternal deaths. They advocate for skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care planning to prevent deaths from infections, which cause nearly 10% of maternal deaths. 10% of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean are caused by unhygienic delivery practices, such as introducing unclean hands or instruments during delivery. USAID supports efforts to distribute delivery kits and train birth attendants to prevent sepsis. Hypertensive disorders account for about 9% of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, and nearly 26% in Latin America and the Caribbean. USAID trains healthcare providers to recognize and treat pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Obstetric fistula is a common consequence of prolonged or obstructed labor in low-resource settings, especially among undernourished young girls and women. Prevention includes delaying pregnancy until pelvic development, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgery when necessary. USAID has supported fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005. Obstetric fistula prevention programs have been integrated with other maternal health initiatives since 1989. Key activities include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, promoting the delay of child marriage, and reducing stigma. Unsafe abortion contributes to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. USAID's family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths in the last 20 years. Funding for USAID's programs grew by about 8% from FY2001 to FY2003. From FY2003, USAID's global health programs saw a 28% increase in support, with significant growth in appropriations for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Congress showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. U.S. focus on HIV/AIDS through initiatives like PEPFAR dominated discussions, raising questions about funding for other global health interventions. Congress consistently increased funding for global health programs, particularly for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, surpassing support for other health initiatives such as child survival and maternal health. From FY2004 to FY2008, $19.7 billion was allocated to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, compared to $4.6 billion for USAID's other health programs. The Administration was urged to better integrate HIV/AIDS with TB and nutrition programs. The U.S. has increased funding for disease-specific programs like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria through key initiatives from FY2002 to FY2010. However, concerns remain about the lack of funding for other life-saving health programs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Experts argue for increased support for child survival and maternal health programs to address preventable child deaths. Some urge Congress to boost support for health issues affecting child survival and maternal health, including voluntary family planning. Family planning activities protect women's health by reducing high-risk pregnancies and children's health by spacing pregnancies. Opposition to funding family planning is based on concerns about abortions and coercive practices. Family planning can help reduce morbidity and mortality rates among adolescent girls, who are at higher risk of complications due to early pregnancies. Young girls are at higher risk of complications from early pregnancies, including prolonged labor and cervical trauma. Adolescents are more likely to die from childbirth, with those under 15 being five times more likely. Obstetric fistula is a common issue, especially among adolescents in Kenya. Prevention includes delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and timely caesarean surgery. Repairing fistula costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many affected individuals. Advocates suggest increasing funding for health systems to address maternal and child mortality by improving access to essential health services and resources. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of donor support for health systems to deliver essential interventions like vaccinations effectively. Advocates urge Congress to coordinate USAID's health assistance with other donors and health ministries to improve efficiency and outcomes. The WHO's International Health Partnership promotes creating compacts with countries to ensure long-term financing and mutual accountability for health plans. Country compacts bind all donors and government agencies to one health plan, budget, monitoring, and evaluation process, with benchmarks for performance. Critics highlight the importance of political will in health spending. African countries spend significantly less on health compared to developed nations. African leaders pledged to increase health spending after signing the Abuja Declaration in 2001, aiming for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. By 2004, only Botswana met this target, with most countries allocating less than 10% to health. Critics argue that structural adjustment programs and lending practices hinder government investments in public health. Limited African governments' abilities to increase investments in public health and health worker education have led to a decline in the quality of education and training opportunities for medical students, a shortage of health supplies and equipment, insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks, and a brain drain of African health workers. The impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures is debated, with mixed results reported. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aim to improve maternal and child health. Bills in the 110th Congress aim to improve maternal and child health by increasing support and funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions. The House version calls for linkages to NGOs for access to HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs, while the Senate version does not include language on family planning. The Global Poverty Act of 2007, H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, aims to reduce global poverty and improve maternal and child health. The U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007, H.R. 2266 and S. 1418, provides assistance for health in developing countries. The Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007, H.R. 1225, also focuses on improving family health globally. H.R. 1225, Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007, amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries. H.R. 2114 provides a U.S. voluntary contribution to the United Nations Population Fund for the prevention, treatment, and repair of obstetric fistula. H.R. 2604 provides support to the United Nations Population Fund for women's health and dignity. S. 1998 authorizes funds to reduce child marriage. S. 2682 focuses on international child marriage prevention. The United Nations Population Fund Restoration Act of 2008 directs U.S. funding for maternal and child health. The Global Security Priorities Resolution calls for reducing nuclear weapons and reallocating savings towards child survival, hunger, and education. H.Res. 1022 affirms commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment. The House agreed to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, recognizing maternal health and child survival as crucial for global development and prosperity."
