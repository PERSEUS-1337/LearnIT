The \"Illegal Worker Prevention Act\" mandates that federal contractors must comply with Immigration and Nationality Act employment provisions to avoid debarment. The policy emphasizes not contracting with employers violating immigration laws and calls for aggressive enforcement of antidiscrimination provisions. The Attorney General is authorized to investigate non-compliance with the employment provisions. The Attorney General is responsible for receiving and investigating complaints of noncompliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) employment provisions by federal contractors. If noncompliance is determined, the Attorney General will notify the relevant executive agencies. The Attorney General notifies relevant executive agencies of noncompliance with the INA employment provisions by federal contractors. The head of a contracting agency considers debarment of the contractor or its unit based on the determination. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in debarment proceedings. Executive agencies have the authority to debar contractors or their units for noncompliance with the INA provisions. Debarment scope should generally be limited to the non-compliant organizational units. Debarment of contractors or their units for noncompliance with INA employment provisions is determined by the Attorney General. The debarment period is initially one year, extendable for additional one-year periods if noncompliance persists. Debarred entities are listed on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs, rendering them ineligible for government procurement and nonprocurement activities. The Attorney General may prescribe regulations and consult with various executive agencies to carry out responsibilities under this section.

It also clarifies that the section does not prevent judicial review of final agency decisions.
