Factors such as reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives have contributed to this decline. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its social and economic costs, especially considering disparities among racial and ethnic groups and states. Prevention Programs focus on reducing teen pregnancy rates by providing data on teen birth rates and pregnancy rates. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish these rates, with birth data being more accurate than pregnancy data due to different reporting systems. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers, with approximately 3.8 million births in the U.S. in 2018. In 2018, there were about 3.8 million births in the United States, with 4.7% to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The teen birth rate peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and declined by 72% from 1991 to 2018. The rate dropped by 58% from 2007 to 2018, reaching a historical low of 17.4. The CDC began tracking teen birth rates in 1960, showing higher rates for older teens compared to younger teens. In 2018, the birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births have declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015. The prevalence of repeat teen births was highest among Hispanic youth, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. Unmarried teen birth rates have decreased from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. Despite an overall decline, certain racial and ethnic groups still have relatively high teen birth rates. In 2018, the teen birth rate varied by race and Hispanic origin, with American Indian/Alaska Native teens having the highest rate. The rates declined for all groups from 1991 to 2018, with larger decreases for certain groups. In 2018, birth rates for teens aged 15 to 19 varied by state and territory. In 2018, teen birth rates varied considerably by state and territory. Massachusetts had the lowest rate at 7.2, while Arkansas had the highest at 30.4. The rates ranged from less than 15 in 18 states to 25 or higher in 10 states. The territories had rates ranging from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. Overall, teen birth rates have decreased in each state or territory by 19% to 67% from 2007 to 2018. Teen birth rates in rural areas remain higher than in urban areas, and the U.S. teen birth rate is higher than that of most other industrialized countries. The U.S. teen birth rate has been higher than most other industrialized countries, with factors such as economic conditions and contraceptive use playing a role. Research indicates that improved contraceptive use, including methods like condoms, has contributed to the decline in teen pregnancy rates from the 1990s to 2007. The recent decline in teen pregnancy risk is attributed to increased contraceptive use among sexually active teens, including the use of various methods like LARCs and the withdrawal method. Factors such as expanded educational opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology have also influenced teen behaviors. Some suggest that the long-term decrease in teen birth rates may be linked to the recession that began in 2007. The decrease in teen births may be due to teenagers being more cautious amidst economic challenges. Factors like social media, internet use, and shows like 16 and Pregnant have influenced teens' knowledge about sex and birth control. Teen pregnancy prevention programs may also contribute to the declining birth rate, but their full impact is uncertain. Teenage parents often have lower education levels and high societal costs. Teenage parents, especially mothers, face challenges such as lower education levels and increased likelihood of living in poverty. These factors contribute to reduced economic opportunities and higher risks of pregnancy. Background differences, like receiving public welfare benefits and parental education levels, may explain the poorer outcomes for teen mothers. Teen sexual activity, even without pregnancy, can also increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Teen sexual activity can increase the risk of STIs, leading to long-term health issues. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high rates of STIs. Teen childbearing can result in poorer outcomes for offspring, including chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness, and higher likelihood of teen pregnancy or incarceration. Societal impacts of teen childbearing include cost savings to public programs. A simulation analysis estimated $4.4 billion in savings from 1991 to 2015 due to decreased teen fertility rates. The analysis estimated $4.4 billion in savings from 1991 to 2015, considering cost savings to Medicaid related to labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care, as well as benefits from TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Further research on the impact of decreased teenage pregnancy could provide insights for teen parents, their children, and society."
