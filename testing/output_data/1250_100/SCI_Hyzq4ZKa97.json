    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. It aims to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. The NetScore metric was compared with top-1 accuracy and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The study presents evaluation results of diverse deep neural networks on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset. There is a growing interest in deep learning for various applications, but the challenge lies in balancing accuracy and complexity. Information density metric is commonly used to measure accuracy relative to network size, but it does not consider computational requirements for network inference. In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network low accuracy. The evaluation includes deep convolutional neural networks like AlexNet BID22. The results aim to guide practitioners in improving network model search and design."
