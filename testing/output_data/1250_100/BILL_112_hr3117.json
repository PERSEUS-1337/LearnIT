    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2012\" and includes definitions. The Act defines terms such as \"actual stamp\" as a paper Federal migratory-bird hunting stamp, \"automated licensing system\" as an electronic system for issuing licenses, and \"electronic stamp\" as a digital version of the actual stamp. An electronic stamp is a unique identifier issued to individuals, can be printed on paper or produced electronically, issued through a State automated licensing system, compatible with the State's hunting licensing system, and described in the State application approved by the Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary may authorize any State to issue electronic stamps in consultation with State management agencies. The Secretary must approve a State's application to issue electronic stamps, which must include details such as the stamp format, fees, accounting process, data transmission to the Secretary, and stamp delivery method. The Secretary can determine the number of new States participating in the program each year. The Secretary must approve a State's application to issue electronic stamps, including details on stamp delivery, duplicate issuance, and other required policies. The Secretary will also publish deadlines, eligibility requirements, and selection criteria for applications. SEC. 5. STATE OBLIGATIONS AND AUTHORITIES. The Secretary mandates that individuals purchasing electronic stamps from a State must receive an actual stamp before the electronic stamp expires. States must collect and submit customer information and revenue from electronic stamp sales to the Secretary. The section outlines the process for states to sell electronic stamps under a written agreement with the Secretary, allowing them to charge fees for issuing and replacing electronic stamps. States are prohibited from requiring the purchase of a hunting license to obtain an electronic stamp. SEC. 6. ELECTRONIC STAMP REQUIREMENTS; RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC STAMP. The Secretary shall require an electronic stamp issued by a State to have the same format as any other license and specify identifying features of the licensee. The electronic stamp bestows the same privileges as an actual stamp, is recognized nationally, and authorizes hunting in other States. It is valid for a period agreed upon, not exceeding 45 days. The authority of a State to issue electronic stamps under this Act may be terminated by the Secretary if the State violates terms approved by the Secretary, or by the State itself with written notice to the Secretary."
