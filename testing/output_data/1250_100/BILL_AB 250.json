    "title": "AB 250",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define terms related to telemedicine, including \"asynchronous store and forward\" and \"synchronous interaction.\" This division applies to health care providers licensed under the code, including marriage and family therapist interns or trainees. The definitions clarify the roles of originating sites, distant sites, and real-time interactions in providing healthcare services via a telecommunications system. Telehealth is the delivery of healthcare services via technology to patients at an originating site while the provider is at a distant site. Providers must inform and obtain consent from patients before using telehealth. Patients can still receive in-person care if they agree to telehealth services. The failure to comply with telehealth regulations is considered unprofessional conduct. Telehealth services must adhere to laws regarding patient confidentiality and rights to medical information. Hospitals can grant privileges for telehealth providers based on medical staff recommendations. The Legislature intends to authorize hospitals to grant privileges and verify credentials for telehealth providers. Telehealth includes telemedicine as defined in federal regulations. Business and Professions Code Section 4980.43 is amended to specify requirements for licensure examinations, including supervised experience hours and completion timelines. No hours of experience can be gained before completing 12 semester units or 18 quarter units of graduate instruction, except for personal psychotherapy. Experience gained more than six years prior to filing for examination eligibility is not allowed, except for up to 500 hours of clinical experience in supervised practicum. A maximum of 1,000 hours of experience is permitted, including direct supervisor contact and approved professional enrichment activities like workshops and seminars. The applicant must have no more than 100 hours of personal psychotherapy, with three hours of experience credited for each hour. Additionally, not more than 500 hours of group therapy or counseling experience is allowed. There is a limit of 500 hours for administering tests, client advocacy, and 375 hours for telehealth counseling. A minimum of 500 hours is required for diagnosing and treating couples, families, and children, with two hours credited for each hour of conjoint therapy. Applicants, trainees, and registrants must gain supervised experience working with elders and dependent adults with limitations. Supervision ensures counseling aligns with training and laws. Experience must be gained as an employee or volunteer, not as an independent contractor. Interns must provide W-2 forms for each year of experience claimed. Interns seeking licensure must provide a letter from their employer verifying volunteer status. Supervision requirements include one hour of direct contact per week for every five hours of client interaction, with additional supervision for those with more than 10 client hours. Face-to-face contact can be individual or group-based. Interns seeking licensure must have direct supervisor contact within the same week as claimed hours, in groups of up to eight for at least one hour. Supervision can be done via video conferencing in certain settings. All experience gained must be monitored by the supervisor. Six hours of supervision per week can be credited starting from January 1, 2009. Trainees can receive credit for supervised experience in settings providing mental health counseling. Trainees seeking licensure must gain supervised experience in settings that provide mental health counseling or psychotherapy. The supervisor must ensure that the trainee's work meets the requirements and is within the scope of practice for the profession. The setting cannot be a private practice owned by certain licensed professionals. An intern in a private practice must be registered and under direct supervision of a licensee. Fair remuneration is encouraged for interns. Experience gained must be part of the intern's position. All individuals must register as interns for postdegree supervised experience hours. (g) Postdegree experience credited towards licensure if intern registration applied for within 90 days of degree. Trainees, interns, and applicants cannot receive payment from patients and must be paid by employers. Trainees and interns must work at their employer's business location under supervision, following laws and regulations. They can provide services via telehealth with licensed supervision. They cannot have a financial interest in their employer's business. Trainees, interns, or applicants receiving up to $500 per month for expenses incurred while providing services in a lawful work setting are considered employees, not independent contractors. Applicants may be audited to verify expenses reimbursement. Each educational institution and supervisor should consider encouraging students, interns, and trainees to undergo counseling or psychotherapy as appropriate. Assistance in locating affordable counseling services should be provided if desired by the applicant."
