    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Identity Theft Notification and Credit Restoration Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the privacy and financial security of individuals are increasingly at risk due to the widespread collection of personal information by both the private and public sector. Credit card transactions, real estate records, consumer surveys, credit reports, and Internet websites are all sources of personal information for identity thieves. Identity theft is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the United States, posing a major law enforcement challenge. Criminals use stolen personal information to open fraudulent credit card accounts, write bad checks, and commit other financial crimes. In 2002, over 160,000 people reported being victims of identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission. Identity theft is a growing concern with over 160,000 victims reported in 2002. Victims face significant challenges in contacting various agencies and institutions to address fraud. The government and private sector share a responsibility to protect consumer information and prevent identity theft through improved notification and fraud prevention measures. SEC. 3. TIMELY NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION. Subtitle B of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is amended to include a new section requiring notification to customers of unauthorized access to personal information. In this section, a breach is defined as the unauthorized acquisition of data compromising the security of personal information held by a financial institution. Personal information for a customer includes their first name or initial, last name, and certain data elements like social security number or driver's license number. The breach of personal information at a financial institution requires prompt notification to affected customers, consumer reporting agencies, and law enforcement agencies if a large number of customers are impacted. This includes sensitive data like credit card numbers or access codes that could lead to financial account information being compromised. Notification of a breach of personal information at a financial institution must be promptly made to affected customers, consumer reporting agencies, and law enforcement agencies. Any entity holding customer information for a financial institution must notify them of any breaches. Notification should be made without delay, taking into account law enforcement needs and measures to address the breach. Delays in notification may occur for law enforcement purposes. Notification of a breach of personal information at a financial institution must be promptly made to affected customers, consumer reporting agencies, and law enforcement agencies. Notification may be delayed if law enforcement deems it necessary for a criminal investigation, but must be provided promptly once the investigation is not compromised. The form of notice can be in writing, electronic form, or other forms if deemed prohibitive by the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission requires financial institutions to promptly notify affected customers of a breach of personal information. Notification can be done through various forms such as email, website posting, media, or as prescribed by the FTC. Additionally, notification must also be provided to consumer reporting agencies and law enforcement. The notification to customers must include a statement informing them that credit reporting agencies have been notified of the breach, and their credit report will contain a fraud alert. Additional information may be included as determined by the Federal Trade Commission. Financial institutions are considered compliant if they have established a notification process. The financial institution must have a comprehensive information security program, notify affected customers and consumer reporting agencies of breaches, and have internal security policies consistent with FTC rules. Customers can seek damages for violations, and actions violating the section may be enjoined. The financial institution's compliance with the section does not violate any laws prohibiting financial information disclosure. It does not create new recordkeeping obligations, and information disclosure is limited to what is allowed by law. SEC. 4. INCLUSION OF FRAUD ALERTS IN CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS. Section 605 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include a definition of fraud alerts, which notify users of potential identity theft and require authorization for credit issuance. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include fraud alerts, which must be included in a consumer's file promptly upon request or notification by a financial institution. The alerts require express preauthorization from the consumer and appropriate evidence of identity. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include fraud alerts in a consumer's file upon request or notification by a financial institution. Consumer reporting agencies must inform anyone procuring consumer credit information about the fraud alert. The Federal Trade Commission will establish the duration of fraud alerts and procedures for their removal. Violations by consumer reporting agencies are addressed. Consumer reporting agencies must notify users of consumer credit reports about the presence of a fraud alert. Users of consumer reports must follow preauthorization procedures in fraud alerts and not issue credit to anyone other than the consumer. It is prohibited to take adverse action against a consumer solely based on the presence of a fraud alert in their file. Access to credit reports and scores is addressed in Section 5. Section 612(c) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to provide consumers with free access to credit reports and scores once a year, and every 3 months if a fraud alert is in place. Credit reporting agencies can charge a reasonable fee for additional disclosures related to fraud alerts. The Credit Reporting Act is amended to include credit scores in disclosures to consumers. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Federal Trade Commission will issue final regulations in consultation with financial regulatory agencies to implement the amendments."
