    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature enacted the 24/7 Sobriety program in California to qualify for FAST Act grant funding and NHTSA funding. This program aims to deter impaired driving by targeting high-risk offenders. A new section, 23582.5, is added to the Vehicle Code to implement the program. Section 23582.5 of the Vehicle Code allows courts to order individuals convicted of DUI offenses to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of probation or release on bond if the offense occurred within 10 years of a prior DUI conviction. A person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege can enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program to obtain a restricted driving privilege if deemed appropriate. Participation in the program is required for a minimum of one year, as an alternative or in conjunction with an ignition interlock device program. A \"24/7 Sobriety program\" requires participants to abstain from alcohol or drugs, undergo frequent testing, and face immediate sanctions for violations. The program must be evidence-based, meeting specific criteria for effectiveness and approval. A person in a 24/7 Sobriety program may need to participate in other DUI programs as required by California law. Testing locations and methods that allow for quick sanctions for violations are preferred. Participants must pay program costs based on their ability to pay. The court can only impose a program longer than 180 days if the defendant tests positive for alcohol or drugs or misses a test. The Office of Traffic Safety must include provisions for the 24/7 Sobriety program in its highway safety plan. The department will collect and report participant data, testing information, and fees. Section 1808 of the Vehicle Code is being amended to include these requirements. Section 1808 of the Vehicle Code is being amended to allow public inspection of records related to vehicle registration, driver's license applications, convictions, and accident reports. The department will disclose abstracts of convictions and accident reports to law enforcement agencies and courts within specified timeframes. The Department of Motor Vehicles will disclose suspensions and revocations of driving privileges for three years, except for specific cases. Judicially set aside or stayed suspensions or revocations will not be disclosed. Personal information will only be disclosed in compliance with the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994. The Department of Motor Vehicles will disclose convictions of specific offenses to courts and law enforcement agencies for 10 years for penalty enforcement. The use of a person's driver's license number by insurance agents or brokers, employers, or prospective employers for obtaining motor vehicle records is presumed if the person provides the license number for insurance coverage or employment eligibility purposes. Agents are authorized to transmit these records and are not liable for their subsequent handling by authorized recipients. Prior to sharing records with insurers without a written agreement, brokers must ensure compliance with state and federal laws on credit reporting and privacy."
