    "content": "The National Child Protection Improvement Act establishes a National Center on Volunteer and Provider Screening under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Congress acknowledges the significant role of volunteers in child and youth organizations, as well as public and private voluntary organizations serving the elderly and individuals with disabilities. Despite the essential services provided, there are instances of abuse, including child sexual abuse in various settings. Such abuse not only harms victims but also undermines public trust in organizations catering to vulnerable populations. Congress has taken steps to address these concerns. Congress has addressed concerns about abuse through the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, setting a framework for screening care providers, including volunteers for vulnerable populations. However, problems regarding safety still exist, with the need for more extensive national criminal history checks using fingerprints. The high cost of fingerprint background checks can be unaffordable for organizations with many volunteers, discouraging their participation. A national volunteer and provider screening center is necessary to streamline background checks for volunteers and care providers, ensuring the protection of vulnerable groups. The current system is slow and cumbersome, leaving children at risk due to delays in obtaining vital information. This center would offer efficient national criminal history checks at no-cost for volunteers and at minimal-cost for employed care providers. \"SEC. 603. DEFINITIONS.\" The Act defines key terms such as 'qualified entity' as a business or organization providing care services, 'volunteer provider' as a person volunteering with a qualified entity, 'provider' as someone employed or volunteering with a qualified entity, 'national criminal background check system' as maintained by the FBI, and 'child' as a person under 18 years old. The term 'child' refers to a person under 18 years old, 'individuals with disabilities' is defined as in the National Child Protection Act of 1993, 'State' has the same meaning as in the National Child Protection Act of 1993, and 'care' includes providing services to children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. Establishment of a National Center for Volunteer and Provider Screening. The Attorney General will establish a national center for volunteer and provider screening to conduct nationwide background checks on individuals working with children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities to ensure they are fit for their responsibilities. This center will access and review Federal and State criminal history records at no or minimal cost to qualified entities. The Attorney General will establish a National Volunteer Screening Task Force to provide nationwide background checks on individuals working with vulnerable populations. The Task Force will determine screening costs for non-volunteer providers and deliver results within 15 business days of the request. Additionally, it will serve as a resource center for volunteer screening information. The Attorney General will appoint members from various organizations to serve on the National Volunteer Screening Task Force for background checks on individuals working with vulnerable populations. The Attorney General appoints members to the National Volunteer Screening Task Force to oversee compliance with the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and report annually to the President and Congress. Authorization of appropriations for background checks of volunteers working with vulnerable populations is provided in the National Child Protection Act of 1993. $80 million is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with $25 million for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2005. The funds will remain available until expended. Requests for national background checks under this section are submitted to the National Center for Volunteer Screening, which conducts searches using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System or other criminal record checks. Qualified entities must provide fingerprints or identifying information and obtain a statement from the provider regarding their criminal record. The National Center for Volunteer Screening may conduct criminal history background checks on providers or volunteers, who are notified of their right to correct any erroneous records. Statements obtained for background checks must be retained for at least 2 years. Providers can contact the National Center to initiate procedures for correcting records. The National Center allows individuals to obtain and challenge their criminal history record report. They will contact state and local systems for missing information and determine if the provider is unfit based on set criteria. The National Task Force provides guidance on volunteer screening procedures. The Attorney General chaired Force encourages the use of best technology for criminal background checks and provides guidelines for fitness determinations. Limitations of liability protect qualified entities and states from damages related to background check failures. The National Center and qualified entities can rely on criminal history record information received for background checks. The fees for background checks conducted through the National Center for volunteers with qualified entities are waived for State requirements adopted after December 20, 1993. This does not affect the ability to collect fees for checks on paid employees. Establishment of a model program in each state to strengthen criminal data repositories and fingerprint technology. A model program will be established in each state and the District of Columbia to improve fingerprinting technology. Each state will receive $50,000 to purchase Live-Scan fingerprint technology or electric fingerprint imaging machines. Additional funds will be provided to hire personnel for training on National Child Protection Act requirements. The National Task Force will receive an annual summary on the State's compliance with criminal data entry provisions of the National Child Protection Act of 1993. $5,100,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with additional funding for fingerprint technology units and data entry personnel in each State and the District of Columbia."
