    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\". It addresses the creditability of service. The FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000 amends Section 8411 of title 5, United States Code to include service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, as creditable service for retirement benefits under certain conditions. An employee or Member must deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for service described in subsection (b)(6). Deposits made more than 5 years later must include interest. Failure to make the deposit will result in a reduction in the annuity based on the service. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERSONS WHO HAVE SEPARATED: Employees or Members must deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for certain services, with interest if deposited more than 5 years later. Failure to make the deposit will result in a reduction in the annuity based on the service. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for obtaining credit for service performed by individuals who have separated from Government service. Credit will only be given upon submission of a written application by December 31, 2001. Any annuity will be recomputed to include the service, effective for amounts accruing more than 30 days after the application is submitted. If the required deposit is not made timely, conditions apply. If the required deposit under section 8411(j) of title 5 is not made timely, a reduction will be made in the recomputed annuity. Interest is not included in the deposit. The Office of Personnel Management is required to notify individuals of their rights under the Act and assist them in obtaining necessary information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Corporation must provide information on an individual's service to the Office upon request."
