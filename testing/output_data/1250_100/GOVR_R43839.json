    "content": "In the mid-1990s, six states challenged the federal government's failure to control illegal immigration, but all cases resulted in losses for the states. The courts viewed arguments based on the U.S. Constitution's clauses, the Tenth Amendment, and provisions of the INA. States claimed the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws imposed disproportionate costs on them, seeking reimbursement under the Naturalization Clause. The Naturalization Clause grants Congress the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. Courts have found that this clause does not obligate the federal government to reimburse states for costs related to unauthorized immigration or protect them from harm by non-governmental parties. The Supreme Court has upheld the federal government's plenary powers over immigration, even if it burdens the states. The courts rejected states' claims that the federal government violated the Guarantee Clause by not compensating them for immigration-related expenditures. The argument was uniformly rejected by multiple Circuits, citing that violations of the Guarantee Clause are nonjusticiable political questions. The courts rejected states' claims that the federal government violated the Invasion Clause by not enforcing immigration laws, stating that the state's form of government remained unchanged and the states were not threatened by invasions. The Tenth Amendment violation claims were also dismissed. The federal government's alleged violation of the Tenth Amendment by \"forcing\" states to provide public benefits and services to unauthorized aliens was uniformly rejected by multiple Circuits. Courts found that states had agreed to provide certain services as a condition of receiving federal funds, and that the costs of incarcerating unauthorized aliens were incurred under state law. Additionally, states were obligated to provide education to unauthorized alien children based on the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe. The states' claims of federal officials violating specific provisions of the INA or other statutes by failing to exclude unauthorized aliens were unsuccessful in court. Provisions cited included Section 103(a)(5) of the INA and former Sections 1252(a)(2)(A) and 1252(c) of Title 8 of the U.S. Code. The states' claims of federal officials violating specific provisions of the INA or other statutes by failing to exclude unauthorized aliens were unsuccessful in court. The statutes cited included a final order of removal for federal officials to effectuate the alien's departure from the United States, deportation proceedings for aliens convicted of deportable offenses, criminal penalties for illegal reentry, and reimbursement of costs incurred by states for the imprisonment of unauthorized aliens or Cuban nationals convicted of felonies. However, the courts deemed these matters to be committed to agency discretion and not reviewable. Notably, the statutes cited by the states used the word \"shall,\" but appellate courts did not specifically address whether \"shall\" indicated mandatory agency action. The federal courts of appeals found that the federal government's immigration enforcement policies in the mid-1990s did not constitute an abdication of statutory responsibilities, despite the states' claims of officials violating specific provisions of the INA. The Supreme Court's 1985 decision in Heckler v. Chaney recognized an exception to agency discretion in enforcement actions, allowing for judicial review in cases of extreme nonenforcement policies. In the mid-1990s, federal courts ruled that states could not challenge federal immigration enforcement as an abdication of duty. Arizona later contested federal enforcement in a 2011 case involving S.B. 1070, which aimed to deter unauthorized aliens. The federal government sought to block S.B. 1070, arguing it was preempted by federal law. Arizona countered by alleging federal immigration enforcement practices were inadequate. Arizona alleged that federal immigration enforcement policies violated the Constitution and federal statute by failing to protect the state from unlawful entry, refusing to reimburse for costs associated with illegal immigration, and not achieving operational control of the border. The federal government challenged Arizona's standing on these claims, except for reimbursement under SCAAP. The district court presumed Arizona had standing, leading to a legal dispute. The federal government did not question if \"illegal immigration\" was an injury in fact, Arizona argued that federal policies influenced unauthorized aliens' choices, and ordering temporary border measures would help. Arizona's claims on the Invasion Clause and Tenth Amendment were precluded by past litigation or settled in the federal government's favor. The court found that the Domestic Violence Clause only applies to civil disorder, not ordinary crimes, and viewed it as a nonjusticiable political question. The federal district court found that Arizona's statutory claims were not subject to review as they involved actions committed to agency discretion by law, specifically related to immigration law provisions directing actions by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The court concluded that each provision lacked a standard for judicial review, making them nonjusticiable political questions. The court found that federal officials have substantial discretion in determining actions related to the construction of the border fence and immigration enforcement. Arizona's challenges were deemed nonjusticiable political questions as they did not constitute an abdication of the Executive's statutory responsibilities. The court ruled that Arizona's claims about federal officials' failure to enforce immigration laws were not valid, as federal officials continue to enforce laws based on established priorities. Mississippi later raised similar claims in 2012 regarding the Obama Administration's DACA initiative, arguing it violated the Take Care Clause and Congress's legislative powers. The ICE agents challenged DACA, alleging it violated the INA and APA by providing benefits to unauthorized aliens without proper regulations. They argued that DACA conflicted with three provisions in Section 235 of the INA regarding admission and removal proceedings. The court found that the ICE agents lacked jurisdiction over their claims challenging DACA. Mississippi was also found not to have standing due to its alleged fiscal costs associated with unauthorized aliens enabled to remain in the state. The federal government did not contest that state funds expenditure could establish standing. The federal government argued that Mississippi did not have standing to challenge DACA due to lack of concrete evidence showing increased costs. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision, stating Mississippi's alleged injury was \"purely speculative\" and not supported by facts. One judge issued a concurring opinion emphasizing that concrete evidence of injury is not always necessary for standing. Over 25 states challenged the expansion of the DACA program by the Obama Administration in December 2014, arguing that it violated constitutional principles, federal immigration law, and APA requirements. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas found that the states had standing to challenge the programs and imposed a preliminary nationwide ban on them. The federal government's motion to stay the injunction on challenged immigration programs was denied by the district court. The Fifth Circuit rejected the government's request for a stay, finding it failed to show likelihood of success on the merits. The Fifth Circuit denied the government's appeal on the challenged immigration programs, ruling that the states have standing to challenge DAPA and DACA expansion. The court also found that the programs are subject to judicial review and should have undergone notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision without providing an opinion due to an evenly divided vote. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on the preliminary nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA expansion. The majority of the Fifth Circuit did not significantly alter the district court's analysis on standing, reviewability, and the need for rulemaking. Texas satisfied the requirements for constitutional and prudential standing to challenge the programs. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on the preliminary nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA expansion. Texas had standing to challenge the programs due to potential significant costs and interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens.\" The majority ruled that the court can review DAPA and DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on the preliminary nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA expansion. Texas had standing to challenge the programs due to potential significant costs and interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens.\" The majority ruled that the court can review DAPA and DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers by affirmatively conferring lawful presence on aliens who violated immigration laws and allowing them to work in the US. The dissent disagreed, stating that the ability to apply for work authorization is not solely due to DAPA but also to existing regulations. The majority also upheld the district court's ruling that DAPA and DACA expansion should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, viewing the programs as legally binding rather than mere policy statements. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision on the preliminary nationwide ban on DAPA and DACA expansion. Texas had standing to challenge the programs due to potential significant costs and interest in denying public benefits to \"illegal aliens.\" The majority ruled that the court can review DAPA and DACA expansion to determine if the Executive exceeded its statutory powers by affirmatively conferring lawful presence on aliens who violated immigration laws and allowing them to work in the US. The dissent disagreed, stating that the ability to apply for work authorization is not solely due to DAPA but also to existing regulations. The majority also upheld the district court's ruling that DAPA and DACA expansion should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA, viewing the programs as legally binding rather than mere policy statements. The majority found that DAPA is not a procedural rule but establishes substantive standards for evaluating deferred action applications, and concluded that DAPA and the DACA expansion violate the APA substantively and procedurally. The majority found that Congress has spoken on the questions at issue, precluding DAPA and DACA expansion. It pointed to INA provisions on lawful entry, relief from removal, and work authorization. DAPA's treatment of certain aliens was deemed unreasonable and contrary to the INA. The majority in the Supreme Court case United States v. Texas found DAPA and the DACA expansion impermissible, citing that Congress has already addressed the issues in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The 4-4 split decision upheld a ban on implementing DAPA and DACA expansion, potentially impacting future executive actions on immigration. States may have limited ability to challenge federal failures to enforce immigration laws in the future, as seen in the 2015 Texas litigation where a court order delayed the implementation of DAPA and DACA expansion. Specific facts and circumstances allowed Texas to challenge these actions, potentially limiting the relevance of this decision to future state challenges. In 2015, Texas was able to challenge DAPA and DACA expansion based on the costs of issuing driver's licenses to beneficiaries. This ability to challenge was due to specific circumstances, potentially limiting future state challenges on federal immigration law enforcement. In 2015, the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws was challenged in Texas. The Obama Administration's proposal to grant deferred action to certain unauthorized aliens was seen as an \"affirmative action\" subject to judicial review, different from enforcement priorities. The court denied the federal government's motion to stay the injunction on DAPA beneficiaries, suggesting that immigration officials could designate them as \"low priorities\" for removal with written documentation, as long as it doesn't involve deferred action."
