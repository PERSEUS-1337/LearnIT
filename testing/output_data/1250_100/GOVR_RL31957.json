    "content": "In the FY2013 budget request, the Obama Administration is seeking $880 million for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in Russia and former Soviet Union states. This includes $519.1 million for DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, $291.4 million for nonproliferation programs, and $70 million for State Department programs. Congress authorized $1 billion in FY2012 for similar programs. The United States has appropriated over $13 billion since FY1992 to help transport, store, and eliminate nuclear, chemical, and other weapons in recipient nations. President George W. Bush supported these programs, and in 2001, the White House emphasized cooperation with Russia to reduce weapons of mass destruction. In 2002, the U.S. and Russia pledged to continue cooperative threat reduction programs and create the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. Under the Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the United States committed $10 billion over 10 years for nonproliferation programs in Russia and former Soviet states. President Obama accelerated these efforts, aiming to secure nuclear materials globally within four years. A White House Coordinator for Nuclear Security was appointed to oversee threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Obama and Russia's President Medvedev signed a Joint Statement in 2009, reaffirming their commitment to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation. The United States has implemented various threat reduction and nonproliferation programs to secure nuclear materials globally. Congress has supported these efforts in former Soviet states, although some projects have faced scrutiny. Questions remain about the effectiveness of preventing leakage of knowledge and materials. Funding for these programs has been authorized by Congress, with some adjustments made to specific projects. The Administration decreased funding for DOE's defense nuclear nonproliferation programs by nearly 10% and cut over $100 million. Some analysts argue that the funding falls short of addressing proliferation risks from former Soviet states. Funding has shifted towards global nonproliferation efforts, raising concerns about completing programs in former Soviet states. Congressional actions on FY2008 and FY2009 budgets reflect these concerns. The congressional action on the FY2008 and FY2009 budgets increased threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Funding for FY2011 faced challenges with some programs receiving more or less money than requested. Congress considered deep cuts that could have undermined U.S. efforts, but ultimately approved funding that will sustain ongoing efforts. This report summarizes the history, evolution, and current focus of U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance programs, with a specific emphasis on funding for programs in the former Soviet Union. Despite expanding efforts globally, the majority of U.S. funds still support projects in the former Soviet states. The report provides a partial view of these programs due to recent shifts in funding and focus. In November 1991, Congress initiated U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the Soviet Union following a failed coup in Moscow and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Senators Nunn and Lugar proposed an amendment to the implementing legislation for the CFE Treaty, authorizing $400 million in FY1992 DOD funds to assist in destroying nuclear weapons and establishing safeguards against proliferation. Senators emphasized the risks of the Soviet collapse. Senators Nunn and Biden warned of the dangers posed by the Soviet Union's collapse, highlighting the risks of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands and fueling global proliferation. They emphasized the need for prompt and safe dismantlement of these weapons to prevent a potential catastrophe. Senator Biden emphasized the importance of targeting U.S. defense resources towards the dismantlement of Soviet nuclear and chemical weapons to enhance national security. Some viewed this assistance as foreign aid, arguing that the U.S. should prioritize its own military needs. Concerns were raised that assisting the Soviet Union could lead to the diversion of resources towards developing new weapons, posing new threats to the U.S. Members have debated whether nonproliferation assistance benefits primarily the recipients or the U.S. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program, initially funded by the DOD, provides assistance to former Soviet States for threat reduction. Other agencies like the State Department and Department of Energy also participate in projects. The term \"CTR\" now specifically refers to DOD-funded programs, while \"threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance\" encompasses programs in DOD, DOE, and State. The implementation of the CTR program was slower and more complex than expected due to the need for coordinated policies among multiple U.S. government agencies and negotiations with recipient nations. Lingering mistrust and secrecy surrounding Russia's weapons programs further complicated the process during the early years of the Clinton Administration. During the early years of the Clinton Administration, efforts were made to resolve bureaucratic issues delaying the CTR program. A high-level commission with Vice President Gore and Russia's Prime Minister Chernomyrdin identified projects that later received funding. The Administration provided significant policy and financial support, increasing expenditures on CTR projects by the mid-1990s. U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance expanded to various agencies and programs, including DOE and the State Department funding efforts in the former Soviet Union. The focus broadened from transportation security to include the destruction of nuclear weapons. The Nunn-Lugar program expanded to include efforts to secure and destroy nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as materials and knowledge needed for weapon production. Funding increased to nearly $1 billion per year, with a shift towards long-term threat reduction and nonproliferation. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry described CTR as \"defense by other means\" in eliminating Soviet weapons and containing threats. In the mid-1990s, U.S. assistance to former Soviet states aimed to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. Concerns were raised about the security of Russian nuclear and chemical facilities, prompting Congress to expand security programs. A task force in 2001 identified the threat of weapons of mass destruction being stolen and used by terrorists or hostile nations as a top national security concern. Since 9/11, analysts have emphasized the importance of addressing this threat. Since 9/11, analysts have highlighted the connection between terrorists seeking weapons of mass destruction and the importance of assisting Russia in safeguarding its weapons, materials, and knowledge. The Bush Administration expanded U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. Funding was increased for export and border control programs, knowledge leakage prevention, and recovery of radiological sources to prevent nuclear materials from being used in dirty bombs. The focus shifted towards proliferation prevention, but efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons in former Soviet states were not abandoned. At the Bratislava summit in February 2005, Presidents Bush and Putin agreed to accelerate efforts to secure Soviet-era nuclear weapons, leading to additional funding for DOD CTR projects. The Obama Administration has expanded these programs globally to counter WMD threats and reduce the risk of terrorism. Dr. Michael Nacht highlighted the transition of the CTR program from a nuclear-centric focus on the former Soviet Union to a broader effort worldwide. Funding requests have reflected this shift, with increased support for securing vulnerable materials globally. The program now emphasizes assisting nations in containing their weapons of mass destruction. The CTR program now focuses on engaging other nations to foster cooperation in containing dangerous weapons and materials. Initially assisting Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan with nuclear weapons, it expanded to include securing materials for nuclear or chemical weapons, preventing scientific expertise diversion, and demilitarizing defense industries. Threat reduction funds also support environmental restoration and housing for former military sites. The 104th Congress reversed the initial focus of the CTR program on environmental restoration and housing for military officers, instead mandating a focus on securing and dismantling nuclear and chemical weapons, preventing proliferation, and safeguarding weapons materials. In the late 1990s, Congress expanded the CTR program to include biological weapons proliferation prevention and emergency assistance for removing weapons of mass destruction globally. The Bush Administration reduced CTR funding in FY2002 and initiated a review of U.S. nonproliferation assistance to Russia and former Soviet states to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. The Bush Administration conducted a review of U.S. nonproliferation assistance to Russia and former Soviet states, leading to a shift in focus towards chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation. This change was seen as a response to post-9/11 concerns about terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The Bush Administration shifted its focus in its FY2004 budget request for CTR, increasing funding for chemical weapons destruction and biological weapons proliferation prevention. Funding for strategic offensive arms elimination in Russia decreased. The program's key objectives were revised to focus on dismantling WMDs, securing related technology, increasing transparency, and supporting defense cooperation. The Bush Administration's FY2010 Annual Report on the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program emphasized the importance of encouraging higher standards of conduct and defense cooperation to prevent proliferation. The program has evolved to pursue broader nonproliferation and anti-terrorism objectives, aiming to deny rogue states and terrorists access to weapons of mass destruction and related materials. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program enhances security by dismantling weapons systems, improving WMD storage, and preventing bioterror attacks. Initially funded with $400 million in FY1992, the program has since received additional appropriations for its activities. Table 1 summarizes the funding requested and authorized for the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program by Presidents and Congress from 1992 to 2006. Congress has approved nearly $9 billion for CTR since 1992, with some years seeing adjustments to the funding requested by the Administration. Notably, in FY1996 and FY2001, there were disputes between the House and Senate over funding levels for CTR, resulting in compromises being reached in conference committees. In FY2000, the House eliminated funding for the construction of Shchuch'ye and redirected funds to security improvements at Russia's chemical weapons storage facilities. The Senate and conference committee approved $475.5 million for CTR, despite the House's decision. In FY2001, the Senate also banned funding for Shchuch'ye and accepted a small reduction in total CTR funding. Total U.S. spending on threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia increased in FY1996, even though CTR funding decreased. The Clinton Administration requested $70 million for DOE programs, with an additional $33 million for the International Science and Technology Center in Moscow. Funding for DOE and State Department programs continued to grow in subsequent years. The Bush Administration's request for CTR funding declined in FY2007 and FY2008, mainly due to reductions in funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. Congress added funding for CTR programs in FY2008, with the House allocating $50 million and the Senate adding $80 million. The Senate added $80 million to the CTR budget request, with $50 million going to biological weapons proliferation prevention. The conference committee accepted the Senate's funding level, authorizing $428 million for CTR, with added funding for biological weapons prevention. Congress also added funds to the Bush Administration's $414.1 million request for CTR for FY2009, with the House authorizing $445.1 million and the Senate authorizing $434.1 million. The conference committee did not retain the provision for new initiatives in CTR within the former Soviet Union but expressed support for such initiatives. The Senate authorized $434.1 million for CTR programs, with added funding for new initiatives and weapons of mass destruction proliferation prevention. The Obama Administration requested $404.1 million for FY2010, reflecting completion of arms elimination projects and reduced funding for biosecurity programs. Congress approved $424.1 million for FY2010 and the Administration requested $522.5 million for FY2011, primarily allocated to biosecurity programs and the Global Security Lockdown initiative. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress approved funding for the Department of Defense's CTR program. The program evolved over the years, initially focusing on chain of custody, destruction, and demilitarization. In FY2012, the program was restructured by the Obama Administration, combining projects under \"Global Nuclear Security.\" The early years of the CTR program focused on chain of custody activities related to the transit and storage of nuclear weapons and materials. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, efforts were made to consolidate and secure nuclear weapons in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. This included commitments to remove non-strategic nuclear weapons and return warheads to Russia. The United States has provided funding and assistance to Russia for transportation security projects related to nuclear weapons. This includes helping improve the safety and security of warheads during transit, providing armored blankets and storage containers, and enhancing the safety of rail cars used for transport. Funding has supported specialized warhead transportation railcars and increased transparency for shipments. The CTR program assists in the secure transport of 1,000-1,500 warheads per year and also provides emergency response vehicles and training for nuclear weapons transportation accidents. The United States has provided funding and assistance to Russia for transportation security projects related to nuclear weapons. This includes improving safety and security during transit, providing armored blankets and storage containers, and enhancing rail car safety. The process was halted between November 2004 and May 2005 for resolution. DOD is helping Russia procure new heated rail cars to replace aging ones. Funding has supported specialized warhead transportation railcars and increased transparency for shipments. Congress authorized additional funding for transportation security in FY2007, FY2008, FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. DOD initially planned to support 70-72 shipments per year through 2011 but reduced it to 48 per year for FY2006, FY2007, and FY2008. The DOD funding supports transporting deactivated nuclear warheads to storage or dismantlement sites, with $45 million authorized by Congress in FY2011. The Obama Administration did not request additional funding for this program in FY2012, incorporating it into the Global Nuclear Security program. CTR projects have improved security at Russian storage facilities for nuclear warheads, including rail transfer points. DOD has enhanced security at national stockpile storage sites and smaller storage sites at military bases under the CTR program. The United States faced challenges in upgrading security at Russian nuclear warhead storage sites due to Russia's reluctance to provide information and access. Despite purchasing equipment, installation was hindered by Russia's lack of cooperation. Agreements in 2003 allowed limited access for site assessments and security upgrades, reflected in increased funding for enhancements. The United States increased funding for security enhancements at Russian nuclear storage sites between FY2005 and FY2006. Presidents Bush and Putin pledged to accelerate this work during the 2005 Bratislava summit. By the end of 2008, DOD and DOE completed installing security upgrades. The US also built a Security Assessment and Training Center for personnel to test security systems. DOD allocated $831.8 million for weapons storage security between FY1995 and FY2010, with $84.1 million appropriated in FY2006. The United States increased funding for security enhancements at Russian nuclear storage sites between FY2005 and FY2006, with additional funding approved for FY2007. Presidents Bush and Putin committed to accelerating the upgrades in 2005. By 2008, security upgrades were completed, and funding shifted towards sustainment activities. The FY2009 request for weapons storage security declined to $24.1 million. The Obama Administration requested $15.1 million for weapons storage security in FY2010, which increased to $22.1 million. The FY2011 budget includes a request for $9.6 million for sustainment efforts at secure storage sites. Russia inherited over 30,000 nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union and is dismantling thousands of them. Several projects aim to enhance the security of removed fissile materials. The United States provided Russia with over 26,000 containers for storing fissile materials and helped build a secure storage facility at Mayak. The facility can hold material from 25,000 nuclear warheads and began accepting materials in July 2006. Despite delays in a transparency agreement, the State Department is working on confirming the origin of stored materials. The United States provided assistance to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan in eliminating nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles. The Clinton Administration credited U.S. assistance with incentivizing these countries to relinquish their nuclear weapons in the early 1990s. The CTR program has helped deactivate thousands of warheads, ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. Destruction and dismantlement projects have focused on eliminating launch facilities and infrastructure. The United States has provided assistance to Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan in eliminating strategic nuclear weapons. This effort has been completed in Belarus and Kazakhstan, with ongoing work in Russia and Ukraine. The US has helped deactivate and dismantle missiles, launchers, submarines, and bombers, eliminating nearly 1,400 ballistic missiles and deactivating over 7,500 warheads. Storage facilities have been constructed for missiles and fuel, with ongoing efforts to eliminate rocket motors from SS-24 ICBMs. Funding for this project area was not requested in FY2006 but has resumed in recent years. The United States supports the safe storage of rocket motors from SS-24 missiles and buys casings from Ukraine. Ukraine is financing the construction of a water washout facility. Funding of $6.4 million was authorized in FY2009, $6.8 million in FY2010, and $6.8 million in FY2011 for this project. In Russia, the US is helping eliminate and dismantle various types of ICBMs and launchers. Funding of $78.9 million was requested for this project area in FY2006. In FY2005, Russia increased missiles and launchers destruction schedule under the Moscow Treaty. Congress approved $78.9 million for the project in FY2007. In FY2008, the Senate allocated $102.9 million for strategic arms elimination in Russia. The increase of $25 million aimed to accelerate activities at storage sites. The conference committee allocated $92.885 million for the project. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for Strategic Offensive Arms Elimination in Russia in FY2009, FY2010, FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. Congress authorized these amounts to support the elimination of various types of missiles and launchers in Russia and Ukraine. The funding also includes dismantlement of a Russian Typhoon submarine and other strategic arms elimination activities. The United States requested $68.3 million for a project in FY2013 related to the construction of a plant to dispose of liquid fuel from Soviet ICBMs. Concerns were raised during the Bush Administration when Russia used much of the fuel for its space-launch program, leaving the facility without fuel. Representative Duncan Hunter criticized the potential waste in the program, but others argue that this case is an exception in the $4 billion spent on threat reduction projects. The CTR program has helped Ukraine eliminate nuclear weapons-related facilities. The United States assisted Kazakhstan in securing fissile materials and eliminating nuclear weapons storage facilities and infrastructure at bomber bases. DOD appropriated $38.2 million for a program in Ukraine and $44.5 million in Kazakhstan between FY1994 and FY2003. Russia declared a stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, stored at seven sites. The United States questioned the accuracy of this declaration, leading to Russia's loss of certification for CTR programs in FY2002. Russia has committed to destroying these chemical weapons stocks by 2007 (with a requested extension until 2012) but claims financial constraints. The United States and a European consortium are assisting Russia in constructing facilities to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. The facility at Shchuch'ye aims to eliminate nearly half of Russia's nerve agent stocks, with construction starting in 2003. Operations began in 2009, and as of September 2011, over 2,365 metric tons of nerve agent had been eliminated. The goal is to destroy around 5,450 metric tons by the 2012 deadline. In late May 2009, Russia had eliminated over 2,365 metric tons of nerve agent at Shchuch'ye. The project faced funding debates in Congress from FY1999 to FY2003, with fluctuations in allocated amounts due to concerns about Russia's commitment to chemical weapons elimination. The Bush Administration requested $200 million for the storage and elimination of nuclear weapons in FY2004. The Senate approved this amount, but the House reduced the funding to $171.5 million. The House mandated that the U.S. could only release funds in excess of $71 million if Russia and other nations contributed. The conference committee approved the full $200 million for the project, eliminating the linkage of U.S. funding to funding from other nations. By December 2003, six other countries had contributed $69 million to the project. The Bush Administration requested $158.4 million for the Shchuch'ye project in FY2005, with a reduction in funding due to a one-time investment in capital-intensive construction equipment in FY2004. Additional funding of $108.5 million was received in FY2006, followed by a request for $42.7 million in FY2007. No further funding was requested in FY2008, raising concerns as the facility was not yet complete or operational. The House Armed Services Committee added $43 million to the budget for the Shchcuch'ye project in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill. Congress approved funding for the project in subsequent years, with additional funding requested by the Obama Administration. Analysts believe more funding will be needed for the facility in the future. The Obama Administration requested $14.6 million for the Shchuch'ye project in FY2013 to provide technical support to Russia in operating the Kizner CWDF destruction facility. Congress has imposed certifications on funding for Shchuch'ye in the past, including requirements for Russia to contribute $25 million annually, destroy all remaining nerve agent, and provide data on its chemical weapons stockpile. The President was granted waiver authority by Congress in FY2003 and FY2004 to continue construction even if conditions were not fully met. The Authorization Bill (H.R. 1588) granted the President waiver authority for the fiscal year 2005, but the House limited it to one year. Congress extended the waiver authority through 2011 to assist Russia in improving safety and security at its biological weapons sites. The Soviet Union had the world's largest biological weapons program, continuing research in the 1990s despite deteriorating infrastructure. The United States provided CTR assistance to help employ biological weapons scientists and enhance security at Russian facilities. The CTR program has supported multiple BTR programs at various sites involved in biological weapons work. The United States helped Russia eliminate infrastructure and equipment at Biological Research and Production Centers capable of producing biological weapons. Programs focus on enhancing safety, security, surveillance, and response networks at these centers. Cooperative Biodefense Research projects aim to increase transparency and prevent the spread of Russian biological weapons knowledge. These programs are implemented through the International Science and Technology Centers. The Biological Threat Reduction program, implemented through the International Science and Technology Centers, supports activities in former Soviet states to address the potential proliferation of biological weapons. Progress in gaining Russia's cooperation has been slow, with difficulties accessing key military facilities and concerns about unemployed scientists. DOD has appropriated around $1.1 billion between FY1997 and FY2011 for these projects. Between FY1997 and FY2011, DOD allocated $1.1 billion for the Biological Threat Reduction program, with recent increases in funding. In FY2004, the Bush Administration requested $54.2 million for these projects, which Congress approved with restrictions on cooperative research funding in the Soviet Union. The conference committee modified the restrictions to ensure no prohibited research occurs at the facility and appropriate security measures are in place before funding cooperative research. Up to 25% of the funds authorized can be used for security measures. The Bush Administration allocated funds for biological weapons proliferation prevention, shifting focus from Cooperative Biodefense Research to bio-security and bio-safety efforts. Funding was also directed towards facilities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia. Congress approved additional funding for BW proliferation prevention in FY2006 and FY2007. The 109th Congress mandated a study by the National Academy of Sciences to analyze challenges and opportunities for cooperation between Russia and the US. The Bush Administration requested $144.5 million for Biological Weapons Threat Reduction programs in FY2008, with funding split between Biosecurity, Biosafety, and Threat Agent Detection and Response, as well as Cooperative Biological Research. Senator Richard Lugar sought to add $100 million for the CTR program in FY2008, with the Senate eventually adding $50 million to support programs throughout the former Soviet Union and accelerate high-priority efforts. The committee authorized funding for Biological Threat Reduction programs, with the Bush Administration requesting $184.5 million in FY2009 and the Obama Administration requesting $152 million in FY2010. Funds were allocated for Biosecurity, Biosafety, Threat Agent Detection and Response, and Cooperative Biological Research. Congress authorized the requested amounts for both years. The House Armed Services Committee called on the Department of Defense to strengthen biological threat reduction programs and pursue interagency coordination. The Obama Administration requested funding for Biological Threat Reduction, with allocations for Biosafety, Biosecurity, Threat Agent Detection and Response, and Cooperative Biological Research. Congress approved the funding requests for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, totaling $259.5 million, $276.4 million, and $276.4 million respectively. The project area is now referred to as Cooperative Biological Engagement. The Cooperative Biological Engagement project area received $276.4 million in FY2013 to extend bio-engagement efforts to nations in Africa. Demilitarization programs in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan aimed to convert military efforts to peaceful purposes. The International Science and Technology Center provided grants to Russian weapons scientists and supported cooperative research with biological weapons scientists. Defense and Military contacts between the US and former Soviet republics promoted counter-proliferation, demilitarization, and democratic reforms, with over $100 million appropriated for this purpose over the life of the CTR program. The Bush Administration requested and Congress approved additional funding for the CTR program in various fiscal years. The program included a demilitarization program and cooperation with countries like Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova to improve border controls and WMD surveillance capabilities. The radiation portal monitoring program in Uzbekistan was completed in 2008, with assistance provided to Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan for similar capabilities along their Caspian Sea borders. The US provided funding for WMD surveillance and interdiction programs in former Soviet Union countries along their Caspian Sea borders. Congress allocated varying amounts of funding from FY2003 to FY2009, with the Obama Administration requesting $29.1 million in FY2009. The Obama Administration requested funding for WMD surveillance and interdiction programs in former Soviet Union countries along their Caspian Sea borders. Congress authorized varying amounts of funding from FY2003 to FY2011, with additional funds requested for FY2012 and FY2013. The National Academy of Sciences was mandated to review the program and suggest improvements. DOD expanded CTR contacts with new countries using funds from FY2009 and FY2010. No additional funds were requested for FY2011. The FY2011 CTR budget did not request additional funds for existing program areas but added a new program area called Global Nuclear Lockdown, requesting $74.5 million. This funding aimed to secure \"weapons-usable\" materials in Russia and establish \"centers of excellence\" outside the former Soviet Union. Congress authorized funding for this program area in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act. However, due to lack of funding in FY2010, it was not included in the continuing resolution. The project area was later merged into the Global Nuclear Security project area in FY2012, combining various previous program areas. The Administration requested $121.1 million for nuclear weapons transportation security and proliferation prevention in FY2012, compared to $118.6 million in FY2010 and $164.3 million in FY2011. Congress approved this amount. The State Department plays a key role in U.S. nonproliferation programs, negotiating agreements and coordinating policies. It manages the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund, with funding ranging from $15 million to $37.5 million between 1993 and 2006. The Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) received varying funding amounts from Congress, with requests ranging from $30 million to $57 million in different fiscal years. The fund was used to expand U.S. efforts in establishing better control mechanisms for nuclear, chemical, and biological materials, as well as eliminating missile systems and securing radiological sources. Funding from the NDF contributed to eliminating Libya's WMD infrastructure and redirecting weapons scientists in Libya and Iraq. Most of the funding was used for projects outside the former Soviet Union. The State Department manages the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) in Moscow and the Science and Technology Center (STCU) in Kiev, Ukraine. Funding is also allocated to the Nonproliferation of WMD expertise category, which includes the biological weapons redirect program. Additionally, the Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) Program is overseen by the State Department. Scientists from Russia's nuclear weapons complex faced economic challenges after the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to concerns about knowledge proliferation. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) and Science and Technology Center (STCU) were established in Moscow and Ukraine, respectively, with support from various countries. The ISTC has funded numerous proposals and awarded grants totaling $836.5 million, benefiting over 70,000 scientists. However, funding for the centers has declined in recent years, and Russia's withdrawal from the ISTC in 2010 has raised uncertainty about its future. The Science Centers fund scientists who have worked on nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, with a focus on nuclear scientists from closed nuclear cities. About half of the participants are senior scientists, reaching a significant portion of the estimated 30,000 to 70,000 senior scientists in the Soviet nuclear complex. Most scientists spend fewer than 50 days per year on projects funded by the centers, with grants also going to research institutes in Russia. Income from research projects may deter scientists from selling knowledge to potential proliferant nations. The Science Centers sponsor a Partners Program for private industry, universities, and government agencies to fund and establish contacts with former Soviet scientists. The program has grown significantly, with over 430 partners providing $9.5 million to support 34 projects in FY2009. The ISTC in Moscow has received over $803 million in funding from participating nations, with the United States contributing about $220 million. The United States also supports the Biological Weapons Redirection Program through the ISTC, redirecting Russian scientists to commercial, agricultural, and public health projects. The Bio-Chem Redirection program, funded by the U.S. State Department, has shifted grant funding from Russia's nuclear scientists to biological and chemical weapons scientists. The program also focuses on scientists from other former Soviet states and aims to support projects with commercial viability. The Bio Industry Initiative helps Russia repurpose former BW-related facilities for peaceful research on infectious diseases. The Global Threat Reduction program has expanded to engage scientists in Iraq and Libya. The Bush Administration requested $59 million for science centers and BW redirection programs in FY2004, receiving about $50.2 million. In FY2005, $50.5 million was requested, with $30.5 million going to science centers. The Bush Administration requested $50.5 million in FY2005, with $30.5 million for science centers, $17 million for the Bio-Chem Redirect program, and $3 million for the BII. Congress approved $52.6 million for FY2006. Funding for programs in the former Soviet Union is decreasing as efforts expand to Libya and Iraq. In FY2007, $52.7 million was requested for the Science Centers, Bio-Chem Redirect, and Bio-Industry Initiative primarily in former Soviet states. Requests for scientist redirection in Iraq and Libya were $2.5 million and $1 million respectively. Funding increased to $64 million in FY2009 and $68 million in FY2010 under the Obama Administration. FY2011 and FY2012 budgets allocated $69 million each for the Global Threat Reduction Program, with a request for $64 million in FY2013. The Administration has requested $64 million for the Global Threat Reduction Program in FY2013. Analysts have raised questions about the science center programs, with critiques from the General Accounting Office in 1995. Critics claim that U.S. funds supporting Russian weapons scientists may also support Russian weapons programs. The State Department disputes this, stating that grants from the ISTC are meant to supplement scientists' income. The State Department has enhanced auditing procedures to ensure grants support assigned projects and not Russian weapons work. Analysts note that the ISTC and STCU lack sufficient funding to fully pay a significant number of scientists. Some question if science centers effectively keep scientists away from weapons work, while others believe cooperation with Russian institutes helps build relationships. Suggestions include focusing on long-term projects to redirect scientists and transitioning them to commercial projects. Concerns about smuggling and illegal exports from the former Soviet Union persist due to political instability and economic weaknesses in newly independent states. The State Department's EXBS program assists former Soviet states and other nations in improving their ability to prevent nuclear smuggling and illicit trafficking of materials for weapons of mass destruction. It helps establish legal frameworks, licensing procedures, enforcement capabilities, and promotes government-industry interaction for effective export controls. The State Department's EXBS program aims to enhance export controls and border security in former Soviet states and other nations to prevent nuclear smuggling and trafficking of weapons of mass destruction materials. The program coordinates with DOD's CTR and DOE's nonproliferation efforts to stop the smuggling of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The National Security Council is developing a strategic plan for interdiction assistance to improve coordination and effectiveness in combating weapons smuggling. Funding for border security in former Soviet states was increased, with Georgia receiving a significant amount for its border security program. In FY2002, the State Department added $24.7 million to the EXBS program. Funding for the program fluctuated in the following years, with requests ranging from $13.9 million to $44.4 million. Congress approved $43.4 million in FY2007, with a significant portion allocated to nations outside the former Soviet Union. The EXBS program funding fluctuated over the years, with requests ranging from $13.9 million to $61 million. The funding allocated to states of the former Soviet Union was consistently less than $6 million, with the Obama Administration requesting $55 million in FY2010 but only a fraction going to these nations. The Department of Energy has also contributed to threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to former Soviet states. In the early 1990s, DOE and DOD officials worked with Russian counterparts to secure nuclear materials, facing delays due to resistance from Russia's nuclear energy ministry. Projects at facilities began in 1994, with U.S. nuclear laboratories also collaborating to address safety and security issues. The Material Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) program started with less than $3 million in FY1993, growing to $73 million in FY1995. DOE took over management in FY1996 and initiated the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention program. In the 1990s, DOE expanded nonproliferation efforts with programs like the International Nuclear Materials Protection and Cooperation program, focusing on securing nuclear materials and improving smuggling detection. The budget for MPC&A grew to $169 million in FY2001. In the 1990s, MPC&A grew rapidly, reaching $169 million in FY2001. The Bush Administration initially reduced funding for the program in FY2002, but Congress restored it to the FY2001 level and added $150 million in a supplemental bill after the September 11 attacks. The Bush Administration increased its budget request for MPC&A in FY2003 to $223 million. The Bush Administration requested $238 million for MPC&A in FY2005, with Congress approving $322 million, including an additional $84 million for accelerating upgrades and material consolidation efforts. The Bush Administration requested funding to secure nuclear weapons sites and materials production sites in Russia. Congress allocated additional funding in FY2006 and FY2007 for warhead security work and new opportunities in warhead security with Russia. The Administration requested $298.7 million to secure nuclear materials in Russia, with Congress allocating $472.7 million for the program. Funding was shifted among project areas, with a focus on sustainment activities and upgrades to storage facilities. The budget also included $119.3 million for Second Line of Defense and Megaports initiatives, leaving $251.8 million for securing nuclear warheads and materials in Russia. Russia identified additional sites in need of upgrades, which may be included in future budgets. In FY2008, Congress increased funding for MPC&A programs, with the House allocating $401 million and the Senate authorizing $381.8 million. The House Energy and Water Development Subcommittee more than doubled the funding to $831.8 million, emphasizing the program's importance in protecting against nuclear terrorism. Additional sites in Russia needing upgrades may be included in future budgets. The committee added funding to accelerate work at Russia's nuclear facilities and expand defense programs. The Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY2008 allocated $624 million for MPC&A, with $136 million for Second Line of Defense and $130.8 million for Megaports. The President's FY2009 budget requested $429 million for MPC&A, with Congress adding $22 million. The Obama Administration requested $552.3 million for FY2010, including a significant increase for the Megaports program. The Obama Administration requested increased funding for nuclear security programs, with $92 million added to the Megaports program for a total of $194 million. Congress approved $572 million for these programs in FY2010 and $569.9 million in FY2012. Funding for FY2011 was held at FY2010 levels, with $265 million allocated to Second Line of Defense and Megaports. In FY2013, $311 million was requested for these programs, reflecting reductions in completed projects. Between FY1993 and FY2012, Congress allocated nearly $5 billion for the MPC&A program to enhance security at nuclear sites in Russia. NNSA identified 105 sites with 243 buildings needing security upgrades, containing around 600 metric tons of nuclear materials. DOE provides assistance in two phases, first installing rapid upgrades to delay unauthorized access. The Department of Energy (DOE) provides security upgrades at nuclear facilities, including hardened doors, monitoring systems, and electronic access control. By 2006, upgrades were completed at 81% of facilities, and by 2007, nearly 90% had been upgraded. Funding has also supported security enhancements at nuclear facilities outside the former Soviet Union. The DOE has provided security upgrades at nuclear facilities, including naval warhead and fuel storage sites in Russia. The upgrades aim to ensure long-term effectiveness and sustainability. Funding for the program, titled National Programs and Sustainability, has supported improvements at 39 naval nuclear warhead storage sites and 11 nuclear fuel storage sites. Upgrades were completed by the end of 2004 for all naval nuclear fuel storage sites and by FY2006 for the last two warhead sites. The FY2006 budget request included $6.5 million for this program area. At the Bratislava summit, Congress approved funding for warhead storage security at navy complex sites. The Bush Administration requested additional funding in FY2007, which was approved by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Subsequent budgets in FY2008, FY2009, FY2010, FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 included appropriations for sustainability support, training, and maintenance at these sites. The focus was on providing additional support for training and sustainability, with funds allocated for replacement of equipment. The DOE completed security upgrades at warhead storage sites for Russia's strategic rocket forces and at 25 sites on 11 SRF bases ahead of schedule. Upgrades were also done at nine sites under the 12th Main Directorate of Russia's Ministry of Defense. Funding for these activities increased over the years, with the FY2006 appropriation at $120.2 million and requests for FY2007 and FY2008 at $129.3 million and $91.5 million respectively. The accelerated pace of completing security upgrades at warhead storage sites for Russia's strategic rocket forces and 12th Main Directorate sites reflected in the funding appropriations. Congress allocated $121.9 million for the project area, with a decrease in funding in FY2009 and an increase in FY2010 and FY2011. The FY2012 budget saw an increase to $59.1 million for sustainability and training programs at 23 SRF sites and 3 12th Main Directorate sites. The Administration requested $8.3 million for FY2013, citing completion of sustainability support efforts in FY2012. The remaining funding will support training and maintenance centers and replace outdated security equipment at up to 11 sites in Russia's nuclear weapons complex managed by Rosatom. Buildings in the complex house around 500 metric tons of weapons-useable materials, with upgrades completed on 85% of the materials by 2006. DOE aims to install security upgrades at all facilities by 2008, with increased funding and cooperation from Russia accelerating the pace of work. Access agreements signed in 2001 have allowed significant access and acceleration of physical protection systems at these facilities. In meetings with Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham aimed to accelerate programs and remove bureaucratic obstacles. The budget for the program area saw fluctuations over the years, with Congress approving requests and appropriations. Funding increased for security upgrades at Russian nuclear weapons sites, with completion of many projects leading to budget reductions in subsequent years. The budget for security upgrades at Russian nuclear weapons sites fluctuated over the years, with Congress approving requests and appropriations. In FY2011, the NNSA budget request included $105.3 million for the Rosatom complex to fund upgrades at sites added after the Bratislava agreement in 2004. Funding would also support projects in other former Soviet states. The Obama Administration requested $80.7 million for the Rosatom complex in FY2012 to support MPC&A upgrades at buildings storing nuclear materials. In FY2013, $47 million was requested for the same purpose, with ongoing security upgrade projects nearing completion. DOE has assisted in securing nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union, with plans to complete upgrades by FY2008. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been increasing funding for securing weapons-useable nuclear materials at civilian facilities outside the former Soviet Union. Funding requests have seen fluctuations over the years, with Congress often approving higher amounts than initially requested by the Bush and Obama administrations. The funding aims to support upgrades at various sites to enhance capabilities for operating and maintaining equipment. The DOE has approved funding for securing nuclear materials at civilian facilities outside the former Soviet Union. The Administration requested additional funding for sustainability efforts, site consolidation, and material conversion. DOE plans to remove nuclear materials from 40% of buildings by FY2003 and convert 17 metric tons of uranium by 2012. Funding requests have fluctuated over the years, with Congress approving higher amounts than requested. The decrease in funding for securing nuclear materials is due to a slow-down in the availability of highly enriched uranium. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved the request, but the House increased it to $21.8 million. The final amount approved for FY2007 was $27.7 million, with increases in subsequent years. The Obama Administration reduced the request to $13.6 million for FY2010, which was approved by Congress. Funding requests have varied over the years, with the Administration seeking additional funds for FY2013 to continue converting special nuclear materials to a less attractive form for proliferation. The sustainability program for securing nuclear materials in Russia involves developing regulations, inspection capabilities, site safeguards, security programs, and training programs. Funding for this initiative has fluctuated over the years, with requests ranging from $29.7 million to $68.5 million. The Obama Administration requested $68.5 million for sustainability programs in FY2010, which was approved by Congress. The Obama Administration has requested varying amounts of funding for sustainability programs to secure nuclear materials in Russia, with Congress approving the requested amounts. Concerns have been raised about the potential for terrorists to acquire nuclear materials for use in a \"dirty bomb,\" with former Soviet Union states posing a greater threat due to scattered radioactive materials. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham highlights the risks associated with the misuse of radiological materials. DOE initiated a program to secure 35 nuclear waste sites in Russia and former Soviet states with radiological materials. They also work with IAEA to secure facilities in other nations. Funding for this effort increased to $24.8 million in FY2005 and was moved to the Global Threat Reduction Initiative in FY2006. Additional funding requests were made for FY2007. The DOE requested $18.3 million for International radiological threat reduction in FY2007 and $6 million in FY2008. The program focuses on installing radiation detection equipment at strategic transit and border sites in former Soviet states. By FY2006, equipment was installed at over 150 sites with plans for 51 more in FY2007. The core program has equipped 161 sites in Russia and aims to equip 370 sites by 2011. Training and communications equipment will be provided to border control agents. The program received increased funding under the FY2002 supplemental appropriations. The DOE received funding for the Second Line of Defense program in FY2006 and the Megaports initiative in FY2004. The Megaports project aims to deploy radiation detectors at major foreign seaports to detect nuclear or radioactive materials. By the end of 2008, the program had completed work at 23 ports and planned to finish at 5 more in 2009. Funding requests for the program were $15 million in FY2005 and $73.9 million in FY2006. The funding is part of the International Nuclear Materials and Protection budget, not for use in the former Soviet Union. The DOE received funding for the Second Line of Defense program in FY2006 and the Megaports initiative in FY2004. The increase in Megaports for FY2006 exceeded the increase in the entire International Nuclear Materials and Protection portion of the budget, signaling a shift in funding. The Bush Administration requested $124 million for Second Line of Defense and Megaports in FY2007, with $84 million allocated to Second Line of Defense and $40 million to Megaports. Efforts to install radiation detection equipment in the Caucuses region accelerated, while Megaports saw a decrease due to equipment installation completion at five ports in 2006. The House and Senate approved the authorization request for SLD, with additional funding from the House Energy and Water Appropriations Committee for a total of $123.9 million. In FY2007, Congress approved a total of $123.9 million for the Second Line of Defense Program and Megaports. The funding allocation included $72.5 million for the Core program and $46.8 million for Megaports. Congress showed a growing concern for port security issues by adding $60 million for high-risk foreign ports. In FY2008, Congress increased funding to $266.9 million, with $136 million for the Core program and $130.8 million for Megaports, reflecting a high priority on detecting nuclear materials smuggling efforts. In FY2009, the Bush Administration requested $212 million for SLD, with Congress appropriating $71.9 million for the Core program and $102 million for Megaports. The Obama Administration requested varying amounts for the Second Line of Defense Program and Megaports in different fiscal years, with Congress appropriating funds accordingly. The funding for FY2013 reflects a transition to sustainability programs after completing the installation of radiation detection equipment. The DOE has installed radiation detection equipment at 450 sites in the former Soviet Union and Megaports equipment at 45 ports worldwide. Funding for SLD has increased sharply over the past decade, with recent funding going towards securing warheads and materials at Rosatom sites. As programs wind down, MPC&A funding and DOE's contribution to nonproliferation programs in Russia are declining. The Russian Transition Initiative is now part of the Global Security Engagement and Cooperation effort. The Russian Transition Initiative, now part of the Global Security Engagement and Cooperation effort, combines two previous DOE programs aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear knowledge from Russia. The program has expanded to include nations outside the former Soviet Union, such as Libya and Iraq. DOE aims to engage not only nuclear scientists but also biological and chemical weapons scientists. Funding was requested to expand the program to two chemical weapons institutes in FY2004. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program, established in 1994, matches U.S. weapons labs and industry with Russian scientists for cooperative research projects with commercial potential. Initially funded with $35 million in FY1994, the program received an additional $194 million between FY1996 and FY2003. In FY2004, the Bush Administration requested $23 million for IPP projects, which was approved by Congress. However, a GAO study in February 1999 criticized the program for funds being mostly spent at U.S. nuclear weapons labs, with Russian institutes receiving only a third of the funds. The report criticized DOE's oversight of the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program, noting that Russian institutes received only around one-third of the funds. Congress reduced funding for the program in FY2000 and requested agreements with Russia to prevent taxation of funds. In 2007, a GAO report highlighted DOE's overstatement of scientist support and lack of commercial successes in the program. The DOE's Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program has been criticized for overstating the number of scientists supported, job creation, and lack of an exit strategy. The program engaged 13,000 scientists between FY1994 and FY2002, with projects in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. It has created 850 high-tech jobs in Russia and received around $125 million in private sector funding. The Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI) program in Russia, established in 1998, aims to bring commercial enterprises to closed nuclear cities to reduce the weapons complex and prevent scientists from selling their knowledge. It received $87 million between FY1999 and FY2003, with additional funding requested by the Bush Administration. Questions have been raised about the program's value and effectiveness, leading to proposed funding reductions in FY2002. The Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI) program in Russia aimed to bring commercial enterprises to closed nuclear cities to reduce the weapons complex and prevent scientists from selling their knowledge. Congress accepted a proposal to merge the NCI program with the IAP program, creating the Russian Transition Initiative. Despite limited funding and uncertain political support, the NCI program made limited progress in addressing employment problems. The Bush Administration announced the program would cease to operate by the end of 2003 due to disagreements with Russia on liability provisions. Ongoing projects continued through 2003, but the program did not receive new funding or begin new projects. In FY2005, $41 million was allocated to the Russian Transition Initiative, some of which supported ongoing NCI projects. In FY2005, $41 million was allocated to the Russian Transition Initiative to support ongoing NCI projects in Russia's closed nuclear cities. The Administration planned to phase out NCI programs in Snezhinsk and Sarov, redirecting funds to help engineers and technicians associated with the shutdown of plutonium production reactors in Seversk and Zheleznogorsk. The budget reduction and shift of funds resulted in a contraction of efforts to redirect Russia's nuclear scientists and reduce the size of its nuclear weapons complex. In FY2007, these programs moved to DOE's Nonproliferation and International Security account with a total request of $28.1 million. The total request for the Security account program was $28.1 million, with funding declining due to reduced activity at certain sites. Despite approval from the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, the Appropriations Committees increased funding to $39.6 million. Over the years, funding varied, with Congress appropriating different amounts than what was requested by the DOE. The United States and Russia pledged to end plutonium production for nuclear weapons in the 1990s, with Russia hesitating to shut down its remaining production reactors. In 1994, an agreement was signed between the US and Russia to provide alternative energy sources for Russian cities of Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. Initially planning to replace reactors with fossil-fueled plants, the cost was estimated at $1 billion. The possibility of converting plutonium production reactors to a type not producing weapons-grade plutonium was explored, with costs exceeding expectations. Each side planned to pay half of the $160 million conversion project cost. After Russia's financial crisis in 1998, the cost of the core conversion project doubled, leading to doubts about its feasibility. The US might have had to cover over $300 million if the project continued. Safety concerns raised the possibility of closing the reactors soon after conversion. In late 1999, Minatom suggested replacing the reactors with fossil fuel plants, estimating a similar cost to the core conversion. By late 2000, both nations agreed to the replacement, but Congress later prohibited CTR funds for the construction. The Bush Administration endorsed the reactor shut-down program and transferred the project to the DOE, with contributions from DOD, DOE, and the State Department. The State Department, DOD, and Congress have contributed funds to the project. The Bush Administration requested and received $50 million for the effort in FY2004 and a similar amount in FY2005. The US and Russia agreed to shut down old nuclear reactors and build new fossil fuel plants by 2008 and 2011. Safety improvements are also being made at the reactors. At the Seversk site, two nuclear reactors are being shut down and an old fossil fuel plant from the 1950s is being refurbished. The United States is assisting Russia in shutting down two nuclear reactors and refurbishing an old fossil fuel plant from the 1950s. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of December 2008. Funding for the project has increased significantly, with Congress allocating over $200 million in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. The goal is to ensure the shutdown of the Zheleznogorsk reactor remains on schedule, with completion expected by 2010. The funding for the Zheleznogorsk reactor shutdown project increased, with Congress allocating $174.4 million in FY2008. Funding for the Seversk site decreased as the project nears completion. The House added $10 million to accelerate work at Zheleznogorsk, while the Senate reduced the request. In the final budget, Zheleznogorsk received $159.1 million. For FY2009, DOE requested $141.3 million, with no funding for Seversk. The Obama Administration requested $24.5 million for FY2010, the expected last year of funding for the project. In September 1998, the US and Russia agreed to convert surplus weapons-grade plutonium to a form that couldn't be used for nuclear weapons. The Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, signed in September 2000, aimed to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium simultaneously. The disposal methods included converting it to mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for nuclear reactors or immobilizing it to prevent its use in weapons. Some critics oppose the MOX option due to concerns about plutonium use in power generation. The United States and Russia agreed to convert surplus weapons-grade plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons. Russia sees value in plutonium for its civilian power program, while the US planned to convert surplus plutonium to MOX fuel. Funding for the US surplus plutonium disposal program was reduced in the FY2005 budget request. The United States and international allies pledged funds for Russia's plutonium disposition program, with Congress appropriating $200 million for FY1999. The Bush Administration requested $47 million for operations and maintenance in FY2004, but the program faced delays due to liability agreement issues. Despite reaching an agreement in 2005, the program still awaits Russia's President Putin's signature. The FY2005 budget included $64 million for U.S. assistance to Russia on plutonium disposition. The United States provided assistance to Russia for plutonium disposition, with Congress authorizing funds for the program. However, there were concerns about the timing and Russia's potential shift towards fast breeder reactors for plutonium elimination. The House Armed Services Committee deleted funding for the program due to nonproliferation concerns. The House Armed Services Committee deleted funding for the U.S. MOX program in Russia in the FY2007 Defense Authorization Bill, while the Senate Armed Services fenced the funding pending a report from the Secretary of Energy. Congress has also questioned the value of continuing with the program and reduced funding for it. The United States and Russia reached an agreement on how to proceed with the program, allowing Russia to burn some plutonium in breeder reactors with modifications to prevent the production of more plutonium. The U.S. will continue funding the MOX fuel plant, and Russia will convert some plutonium into this fuel. Critics argue that the agreement will slow the process of eliminating Russia's weapons-grade plutonium. The agreement will slow the process of eliminating Russia's weapons-grade plutonium. Funding for the program was not included in the FY2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, but prior year funds are available. The Bush and Obama Administrations requested only $1 million for FY2009 and FY2010 respectively for technical oversight. The Obama Administration requested $113 million for Russian Materials Disposition in FY2011. Congress authorized funding in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act, but did not appropriate funds in the continuing resolution due to lack of funding in FY2010. The Administration withdrew the request for $100 million. The Administration withdrew the request for $100 million of the FY2010 funds for Russian fissile materials disposition. Congress appropriated only $1 million for this program in FY2012, and the Administration has requested $3.8 million for FY2013. Various issues have arisen since the Nunn-Lugar amendment, including concerns over specific projects like the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye and broader questions about the effectiveness of U.S. threat reduction assistance to Russia and other former Soviet states. The debate over U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia continues, with questions about whether it represents defense or foreign aid. Critics raise concerns about whether the assistance allows Russia to divert resources to develop new weapons. Issues from the first decade of the programs are being reassessed for improvement in the second decade, with a focus on the potential link between weapons of mass destruction in Russia and terrorist organizations. The discussion reviews concerns raised by supporters and critics of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia. Implementation of the programs was initially slow due to the need for umbrella agreements with Russia and coordination among U.S. government agencies. Analysts highlight ongoing coordination challenges among the key agencies - DOD, DOE, and State - in setting policies and priorities for the programs. Some analysts propose creating a strategic plan and appointing an overall program coordinator to enhance U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance. The Bush Administration's review in 2001 focused on allocating resources and expanding mandates, but experts suggest a more comprehensive government-wide strategic plan is needed. Former Senator Pete Domenici emphasizes the complexity of these intertwined programs, while a DOD and DOE analyst notes the growth of U.S. programs. The growth in U.S. programs has been organic, with each agency pursuing its own contacts and relationships in recipient countries. Analysts suggest a strategic plan for better coordination, setting priorities, and measuring progress. They also recommend appointing a high-level program coordinator to eliminate overlap and ensure consistent political leadership. The need for a high-level program coordinator to provide consistent political leadership for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs has been debated. While some argue that existing interagency coordination is sufficient, others believe a new coordinator is necessary to ensure success. Congress has supported the idea of a coordinator, but the Clinton and Bush Administrations have not accepted the proposal. In late 2006, legislation was introduced to create a Senior Advisor to the President for the prevention of nuclear terrorism. This advisor would oversee the development of program implementation strategies and budget requests. Another piece of legislation in 2007 established an Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism within the Executive Office of the President. The legislation introduced in late 2006 aimed to create a Senior Advisor to the President for preventing nuclear terrorism. The Obama Administration later established a new NSC position for coordinating the prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism, with a focus on threat reduction efforts and budget responsibilities. This new policy position is seen as critical for success, with analysts suggesting that a White House-based nonproliferation \"czar\" could help communicate high-level interest and political commitment to the programs. Many analysts and government officials highlight the challenges in implementing threat reduction projects, particularly in gaining access and transparency from recipient nations like Russia. Delays in providing access to nuclear weapons storage areas and incomplete information on biological weapons facilities have hindered security improvements. Russia has not provided complete information or access to its biological weapons complex and nuclear weapons facilities, hindering security improvements. Delays in transparency agreements with the United States for the Mayak facility storing fissile materials have also been a challenge. The lack of cooperation undermines support for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Photographs and diagrams are used instead of on-site visits to identify security weaknesses and design improvements at nuclear complex sites. Better coordination among threat reduction programs is needed, with a single program coordinator suggested to help agencies share solutions. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act called for a report on impediments to program implementation, including problems with access to Russian facilities. An umbrella agreement between the United States and Russia outlines rights and responsibilities for implementing programs funded by U.S. threat reduction assistance. If the agreement were to lapse, new contracts for projects funded by U.S. assistance could not be awarded. The original agreement between the United States and Russia, set to last for seven years, was extended for another seven years in 1999 and was due to expire in June 2006. It covered programs funded by the Department of Defense, with the Department of Energy adopting a similar agreement for its programs in the former Soviet Union. The main point of contention was liability for accidents during project implementation, with Russia initially assuming all liability. However, disagreements arose over liability provisions, particularly regarding accidents resulting from sabotage. This disagreement hindered the conclusion of a new implementation agreement for the Plutonium Disposition Program. The United States was reluctant to ease its stance on providing blanket liability protection for U.S. contractors. By mid-2005, the United States and Russia realized that resolving the liability issue in the Plutonium Disposition Program was crucial for progressing negotiations on the broader umbrella agreement. Failure to address this could jeopardize the nonproliferation efforts in Russia. Contractors in the DOE program were open to accepting liability for accidents from sabotage, potentially paving the way for a solution and facilitating the conclusion of a new umbrella agreement. The United States and Russia reached agreement on liability provisions for the DOE programs during the G-8 summit in July 2005. The new agreement retains blanket liability protections for existing projects but addresses Russia's concerns for future projects. U.S. contractors could be liable for damages from sabotage or accidents in some circumstances. The United States had requirements that recipient nations had to meet before receiving U.S. threat reduction assistance, including commitments to dismantling weapons, forgoing military modernization, and complying with arms control agreements. The President had to certify these commitments to Congress. The Clinton Administration certified Russia for several years despite questions. The Bush Administration withheld Russia's certification due to concerns about compliance with chemical and biological weapons agreements. Congress debated adding new exclusions to the CTR legislation to provide more precise standards for recipient nations. Congress has rejected efforts to cut off U.S. threat reduction assistance to Russia, instead crafting requirements with language that gives the President flexibility. New certification requirements were added related to the construction of the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye in FY1998 and FY1999. The United States required certification from Russia regarding its chemical weapons stockpile size, annual commitment to elimination, and practical plan for destruction before providing funding for chemical weapons destruction activities in Russia. Congress added new certification requirements related to the construction of the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye in FY1998 and FY1999. The Bush Administration announced in April 2002 that it could not certify Russia's commitment to arms control obligations under the Chemical Weapons and Biological Weapons Conventions, which stalled ongoing CTR projects. Congress supported the Administration's view that CTR programs served U.S. national security interests and included a waiver to continue funding CTR programs in Russia. The House and Senate included waiver authority in the Defense Authorization Bill to serve U.S. national security interests. The Senate granted the President permanent waiver authority, while the House only allowed it for FY2003. The conference committee provided the President with three years of waiver authority, but it only applied to certain exclusions. Congress granted one year of waiver authority for a specific project in FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005. The House proposed another three years of waiver authority in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Bill. The conference committee adopted the Senate's position, providing the President with unlimited waiver authority in the FY2007 Defense Authorization Bill. The Bush Administration believed that certification requirements and Presidential waivers were essential to encourage greater openness in Russia and signal that Russian behavior must meet U.S. standards. Congress supported this approach, allowing the President to waive certifications if necessary. Some in Congress supported prioritizing threat reduction assistance to Russia, while others believed Russian policies in other areas should not interfere. There were proposals to amend CTR legislation to remove certification requirements or provide the President with permanent waiver authority. However, some argued that Russian policies in areas like nuclear cooperation with Iran and arms control compliance pose higher security threats and should be prioritized over threat reduction assistance. The 110th Congress eliminated certification requirements from the CTR program, allowing for U.S. assistance without restrictions. The U.S. allocates over $1 billion annually for threat reduction programs in the former Soviet Union and additional funds for programs in other nations. Some analysts suggest increasing funding, with one report recommending up to $30 billion over the next decade for securing nuclear materials. The funding for threat reduction programs in the former Soviet Union does not include DOD or State Department programs, which could amount to around $5 billion over 10 years. Analysts believe that increased funding may not necessarily speed up all U.S. programs, citing implementation issues like limited access to facilities and delays in certifying Russia for assistance. However, they point out specific programs, such as science centers in Moscow and Kiev, plutonium disposal in Russia, and reactor elimination projects, that could achieve better results with more funding. Export and border control programs could also benefit from increased funding. The Bush Administration agreed to add funding to programs like science centers, export, and border control to accelerate progress. Additional international funding was called for to shut down Russia's plutonium-producing reactors and improve security at storage sites for nuclear warheads. With a fixed budget of $1 billion per year, trade-offs between projects may be necessary. DOE sought funding in FY2004 to accelerate the blend-down of highly enriched uranium. In FY2004, DOE sought funding to accelerate the blend-down of highly enriched uranium and to secure radiological sources. Funding for MPC&A projects in Russia's nuclear weapons complex was reduced, while some programs are finishing, allowing increased funding for others. Large construction projects funded in the 1990s are concluding, leading to reduced budgets for strategic arms elimination and chemical weapons destruction. This could impact the US commitment to spend $1 billion annually. DOD's CTR budget has declined, and DOE's funding for programs in Russia decreased as security upgrades were completed. These changes may result in added funding for new projects in the former Soviet Union or for anti-terrorism projects. President Obama has pledged to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials globally in four years, with a nuclear security summit held in April 2010. Analysts predict potential increases in funding for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs outside the former Soviet Union. The source of these increases is uncertain, whether from a new budget, funds from completed projects, or a reduction in funding for ongoing projects in the former Soviet Union. U.S. programs aim to consolidate, contain, and destroy weapons and materials, as well as preserve weapons knowledge. The United States aims to secure nuclear materials globally and prevent their leakage from the former Soviet Union. New projects focus on setting up barriers outside the nuclear weapons complex to complement efforts to protect materials at their source in Russia. There is a debate over funding and priorities for threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance. The global threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation requires international cooperation. The G-8 Global Partnership is an initiative to expand assistance programs for threat reduction and nonproliferation. Other nations can contribute funding and cooperative efforts to help secure weapons, materials, and knowledge. The G-8 Global Partnership aims to expand threat reduction and nonproliferation programs by involving more countries. The initiative includes extending U.S. assistance beyond the former Soviet Union and encouraging all nations to secure weapons of mass destruction. At the G-8 summit in 2002, a long-term program was established to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, with the U.S. pledging $10 billion over 10 years for ongoing programs in Russia. The G-8 nations, including Russia, have agreed to provide up to $10 billion over 10 years for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Russia has committed $2 billion and agreed to adopt guidelines for transparency and access at work sites. The assistance will be tax-free and include liability protections for donor countries. The program initially focuses on Russia but has been extended to Ukraine. The United States sees its assistance to former Soviet states as part of the Global Partnership commitment. The G-8 Global Partnership aims to redirect scientists in Iraq and Libya, with various nations joining the program to provide assistance. President Bush emphasized the need to expand the list of donors and recipients. The program has seen participation from European nations and others like Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea. The Global Partnership has received pledges of around $17 billion, including $10 billion from the United States. Questions remain about sustained funding over the next 10 years due to economic challenges. Participating nations continue to fund numerous projects in recipient nations, with priorities set on projects like chemical weapons destruction and nuclear submarine dismantlement. The Global Partnership, funded by multiple nations including the United States, focuses on projects like chemical weapons destruction and nuclear submarine dismantlement. Additional funding is seen as crucial to expand and accelerate these high-priority projects. Senator Richard Lugar proposed an amendment to use $50 million in FY2003 CTR funds for resolving proliferation threats and achieving nonproliferation goals globally. This effort aims to assist nations in securing or destroying weapons and creating international standards for handling nuclear material and deadly pathogens. The Bush Administration sought authorization to spend up to $50 million in CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union for threat reduction efforts. The Senate supported this measure, but the House preferred managing such programs through the State Department. Ultimately, the House authorized the transfer of up to $78 million in CTR funds to the State Department for threat reduction efforts outside the former Soviet Union. The conference committee approved the President's request to use up to $50 million in CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union for short-term projects. The President was tasked with determining the most capable agency to implement the projects. The Senate proposed giving the Secretary of Defense approval authority for expenditures outside the former Soviet Union to streamline the process, but the House objected. The 110th Congress expanded the authority to spend CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union and streamlined the process for identifying and approving projects. Congress added $10 million to fund these programs and eliminated the requirement for short-term projects only. CTR programs outside the former Soviet Union are now defined similarly to those inside, focusing on eliminating, transporting, and storing chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons to prevent proliferation. The 110th Congress expanded the authority to spend CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union, emphasizing the prevention of proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. They also aimed to expand military-to-military and defense contacts globally, including in Asia and the Middle East, to strengthen and broaden international cooperation and partnerships. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a study on strengthening and expanding the CTR Program, recommending a new global effort to secure dangerous weapons and materials. The FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill included a provision for DOD to accept funds from other nations for CTR efforts. The Obama Administration supports expanding CTR and DOE's nonproliferation assistance beyond the former Soviet Union. Advocates argue that the U.S. could apply its threat reduction assistance model to help other nations secure and eliminate weapons attractive to terrorists. Some question the applicability of the CTR Program to nations outside the former Soviet Union, citing concerns about access to facilities housing nuclear materials, legal issues, and the potential unintended consequences of U.S. assistance in securing weapons. The proliferation threat and link to terrorism highlight the presence of dangerous materials in many nations worldwide. There is a growing consensus that the international community and individual nations should take steps to address problems with dangerous materials, such as radiological dispersal devices, chemical, and biological weapons. Efforts to expand Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programs beyond the former Soviet Union could help address the issue. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chemical Weapons Convention could also play a role in securing and accounting for these materials. The Convention provides a diplomatic and political mechanism for nations to secure and account for chemical agents and materials. The focus of U.S. threat reduction assistance is shifting towards addressing concerns about terrorist acquisition of nuclear, chemical, and biological materials. Global cooperation is key in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in multiple countries, with U.S. funding and technical assistance still playing a significant role. Other nations may also offer their experience, expertise, and financial resources in addition to U.S. funding and technical assistance in global cooperation efforts."
