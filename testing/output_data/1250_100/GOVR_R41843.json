    "content": "A number of groups and individuals are focusing on U.S. rules governing imports from North Korea due to the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. The agreement's opponents argue it could increase U.S. imports of goods from North Korea, but currently, the U.S. imports very few finished goods from North Korea. The KORUS FTA opponents are concerned about potential increase in U.S. imports of goods from North Korea, particularly through the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Currently, U.S. imports of finished goods from North Korea have been minimal, with only $8,363 worth of stamps imported in June 2010. Critics fear that South Korean firms could use low-cost Kaesong-made goods or components in finished products and ship them to the U.S. with \"Made in [South] Korea\" labels, benefiting the North Korean government. The United States has regulations governing imports from North Korea, with restrictions on exports to the country. President Clinton loosened restrictions on U.S. exports and imports in 1999, except for national security concerns. President Bush terminated Trading With the Enemy Act authorities in 2008 and removed North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The Korean government was removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, but import restrictions from North Korea remained in place. President Obama invoked national emergency authorities to block assets of individuals and entities importing luxury items into North Korea. The President expanded import restrictions from North Korea in 2011, prohibiting goods, services, and technology. North Korea engaged in provocative actions from 2008 to 2010, leading to tensions with South Korea. In May 2010, a group determined North Korea's involvement in sinking a South Korean naval vessel. It is important to distinguish between North Korean finished goods under U.S. laws and regulations. The importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States is prohibited without approval from OFAC. This restriction is in accordance with Executive Orders 13466, 13551, and 13570. The President authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to implement regulations prohibiting the importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States without OFAC approval. The President can revise or revoke the executive order if national emergency conditions no longer exist, with annual renewal required to maintain its validity. Importers must obtain OFAC approval to bring North Korean goods into the U.S. through a third country. The President authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to implement regulations prohibiting the importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States without OFAC approval. New regulations issued by OFAC in June 2011 implement the license requirements for both direct and indirect importing. OFAC intends to supplement its regulations with additional guidance and licenses as needed. The scope and timing of regulatory requirements may be affected by any significant expansion of North Korea's export sector. The North Korean economy is highly isolated due to its policy of self-reliance and suspicion of foreign countries. Its export markets have shrunk to mainly South Korea and China, with exports to South Korea increasing through the Kaesong Industrial Complex. This trend accelerated in 2010 when South Korea halted non-KIC trade with North Korea. By the end of 2010, most of North Korea's exports to South Korea were from activities in the KIC. In 2010, the Kaesong Industrial Complex had over 120 South Korean manufacturing companies, producing $323 million in output. Most of the manufacturers focused on clothing, textiles, kitchen utensils, auto parts, semiconductor parts, and toner cartridges. About 10% of the production was exported to countries like Australia, the European Union, Russia, and China. The complex's future depends on inter-Korean relations and South Korean leaders' policies. President Lee Myung-bak's government has been uncertain about the KIC's expansion. The Kaesong Industrial Complex has faced uncertainty under President Lee Myung-bak's government, with plans for expansion halted due to deteriorating inter-Korean relations. Despite this, the complex has continued to grow incrementally. The dilemma lies in the financial cost of closing down the complex, as well as the political support it enjoys in South Korea. The future of the KIC remains uncertain, with the potential for either expansion or closure under future South Korean leadership. The project provides revenue to the North Korean regime, posing a dilemma for U.S. and South Korean policymakers. The Kaesong Industrial Complex generates revenue for North Korea through salaries paid to workers, estimated at $20 million per year. The complex also serves as a potential platform for market reforms in North Korea, with the KORUS FTA considering preferential treatment for zones like the KIC. China plays a significant role in North Korea's economic relations, being a major importer and provider of foreign assistance. North Korea's exports to China include coal, apparel, iron, seafood, and zinc. North Korea has increased exports of primary and mineral products, importing aquaculture technology and agricultural equipment mainly from China. Coal and mineral exports are facilitated through partnerships with Chinese firms. China aims to create an integrated industrial region with North Korea. China is strategically investing in North Korean industries, building roads, and creating a free trade zone. Chinese companies are engaged in various sectors in North Korea, including mining, agriculture, industrial parts, apparel, and automotive. This collaboration could potentially lead to North Korean products entering Chinese supply chains and being exported to the U.S. market. The KORUS FTA could potentially allow North Korean goods to enter the US market through Chinese supply chains. Critics argue that the agreement lacks sufficient rules of origin and could give preferential treatment to products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea. The US government's ability to restrict imports from North Korea may also be constrained by the FTA. The KORUS FTA agreement included a provision for the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in North Korea, which the United States opposed. A compromise was reached by creating a special committee to handle the issue. The provision, Annex 22-B, established a process for reviewing conditions on the Korean Peninsula for economic development through outward processing zones. This would allow goods to be deemed \"originating\" under the agreement for preferential tariff treatment. A Committee on Outward Processing Zones on the Korean Peninsula would be established by the United States and South Korea. The Committee on Outward Processing Zones, comprising officials from the United States and South Korea, will meet annually to identify areas for OPZs and establish criteria for goods to be considered originating for FTA purposes. Decisions made by the committee will be recommended to both countries for legislative approval. The Office of the United States Trade Representative stated that extending KORUS tariff benefits to products made in Kaesong or any OPZ would require new legislation. Congress has the authority to impose duties and must authorize specific tariff rates. Goods from countries subject to Title IV of the Trade Act, like North Korea, can only receive NTR treatment under certain conditions. The President must follow Title IV requirements to grant NTR tariff status to countries entering the World Trade Organization. Imports not subject to Title IV or other restrictions can only receive NTR tariff status with explicit authorization. Presidential proclamation authority in KORUS FTA legislation likely applies to goods from South Korea only. Critics want Annex 22-B removed from the agreement and products from Kaesong Industrial Complex excluded. New legislation would be needed to extend tariff benefits to products from Kaesong or any OPZ. The KORUS FTA's supporters reject the need for further modifications, citing existing rules to restrict imports from North Korea. The agreement includes provisions that make it unlikely for the US to restrict imports from South Korea containing North Korean components. The KORUS FTA includes provisions on import prohibitions or restrictions, covering measures like quotas or import licenses. These restrictions may not apply to goods of the other Party, including those manufactured in South Korea with components from a third country. Exceptions to this obligation are outlined in the agreement, such as allowing a Party to limit imports from a non-signatory country without violating the agreement. The KORUS FTA allows for import prohibitions or restrictions, with exceptions for goods from non-signatory countries. The agreement permits the United States to prohibit imports from North Korea, affecting trade with South Korea as well. Article 2.8.4 applies to all U.S. import embargoes, including those with Cuba and Iran. The term \"good of the non-Party\" includes components used in third-country production. The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) did not override existing Cuban sanctions. Both agreements contained provisions to restrict the importation of Cuban products or goods made from Cuban materials. Chapter 6 of the KORUS FTA also addresses import restrictions. Chapter 6 of the KORUS FTA discusses import restrictions, separating admissibility from tariff treatment. The agreement's security exception allows for necessary measures to be taken, potentially impacting goods with North Korean content. The KORUS FTA includes a security exception clause that allows a Party to apply measures for international peace, security, or essential security interests. This clause is self-judging and may impact trading partners. In disputes, if the essential security exception is invoked, the tribunal must find that it applies. The United States implemented a sanction against North Korea that may violate a KORUS FTA obligation to South Korea or investors. If the U.S. defends the measure under the \"essential security\" exception, the tribunal cannot question its validity. Critics argue that South Korean manufacturers could use North Korean components in exports to the U.S. through rules of origin. Customs officials use rules of origin (ROO) for governmental purposes, such as enforcing trade restrictions and collecting statistics. Determining origin can be complex when products have components from multiple countries, like in the automotive sector. The KORUS FTA's ROO are relevant for imports from North Korea, where North Korean components would not help qualify for FTA benefits. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin determine product eligibility for preferential treatment under the FTA, excluding non-signatory countries. Regional value content rules require a percentage of inputs from the US or South Korea, incentivizing manufacturers to source locally. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin incentivize manufacturers to meet regional value content requirements to benefit from lower tariffs, particularly for passenger cars and trucks. Meeting the ROO allows South Korean manufacturers to avoid U.S. NTR duties, giving them a price advantage over manufacturers from China, Japan, or Europe. Other industrial sectors may also see similar benefits under the FTA. The KORUS FTA's \"Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation\" chapter enhances cooperation between U.S. and South Korean customs officials through information sharing, joint training programs, and enforcement of regulations. This promotes rules-based trade, deepens economic ties, and limits the entrance of North Korean-manufactured inputs into the U.S. Members of Congress may seek additional provisions if unsatisfied. The KORUS FTA's preferential terms may not impact U.S. sanctions on North Korean imports. Provisions in the agreement aim to maintain U.S. restrictions on North Korean goods. Rules of origin under the KORUS FTA would apply only with OFAC license for importers under sanctions. The issue of handling imports from North Korea revolves around customs controls, cooperation, and enforcement. Currently, U.S. restrictions on North Korean imports have not been significantly challenged due to minimal exports. However, if North Korean industry revives, the challenge of circumventing import restrictions could increase, especially through increased economic ties with China or expansion of the Kaesong Industrial Complex. There is no way to guarantee that goods or components do not originate from North Korea. The challenge of enforcing U.S. import restrictions on goods or components from North Korea is highlighted, especially in the automobile supply chain where evasion of customs authorities could occur. The effectiveness of enforcement depends on U.S.-South Korea customs cooperation and penalties for non-compliance, potentially enhanced by the KORUS FTA."
