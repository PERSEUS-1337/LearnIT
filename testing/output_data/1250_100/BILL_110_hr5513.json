    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stop Adolescent Smoking Without Excessive Bureaucracy Act of 2008\" and aims to strengthen state laws regarding tobacco product sales to individuals under the age of 18. For fiscal year 2010 and subsequent years, the Secretary can grant funds under section 1921 if the state has a law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to individuals under 18. It is also illegal for individuals under 18 to purchase, receive, or possess tobacco products in public places. Law enforcement must take action if a minor is found violating these laws. Any person distributing tobacco products at retail must notify employees about laws prohibiting sales to individuals under 18 and ensure compliance. Employers are not in violation if minors possess tobacco products in public places. Employers who rely on valid age proof or implement a program can avoid penalties for violating the prohibition on selling tobacco to minors. States with delayed legislative sessions have a later deadline for compliance. Funding agreements for grants must align with state goals for noncompliance starting from the first applicable fiscal year. The funding agreement for a grant under section 1921 requires states to establish goals for reducing the rate of retailer violations of tobacco laws through annual inspections. The rate of violations must decrease each fiscal year, with a target of 10 percent from fiscal year 2020 onwards. States must also enforce the law to receive the grant. The funding agreement for a grant under section 1921 requires states to enforce tobacco laws to reduce availability to individuals under 18.
