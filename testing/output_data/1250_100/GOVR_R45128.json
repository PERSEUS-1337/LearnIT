    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included higher budget caps from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The enacted Agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion, a $2.1 billion increase from FY2017. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2018, with the House passing a consolidated bill that included agriculture. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation is $146 billion, with a $15.8 billion discretionary total. The bill funds USDA and FDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and includes mandatory and discretionary spending. The Trump Administration released its full FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill includes both mandatory and discretionary spending, with discretionary amounts being the primary focus. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is set in laws like the 2014 farm bill. In FY2018, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, with mandatory spending making up the majority at 84%. In the FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill, the $123 billion mandatory amount is attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill. The largest discretionary spending items include WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance programs, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. The main mandatory spending items are SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity and conservation programs paid through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. SNAP requires an annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. The Agriculture appropriations bill has seen changes in funding levels over time, with peaks in FY2010 and declines through FY2013 before increasing again. The discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008 is shown in Figure 3. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request later than usual in 2017. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request in 2017, proposing a 21% reduction for USDA and FDA programs. Congress reminded the Administration of its authority to set final funding levels for FY2018. The Administration's budget outline differed from some OMB proposals, and CFTC requested a different amount in its budget justification. The CFTC requested a different amount in its budget justification compared to the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee allocated nearly $20 billion for the Agriculture Subcommittee for FY2018. The House passed an eight-bill package on September 14, 2017, as the fiscal year approached without many appropriations bills being passed. The House passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation on September 14, 2017, with Agriculture as Division B, totaling $20 billion in discretionary funds for FY2018. The bill included reductions in rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research compared to FY2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $20.53 billion for the Agriculture Subcommittee for FY2018. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on July 18, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed and reported its amended bill on July 20, 2017. The Senate-reported bill had a discretionary total of $20.53 billion, making fewer and smaller reductions compared to the House-passed bill for FY2018. Congress passed CRs to fund the government as FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation. Congress has passed Continuing Resolutions (CRs) to fund the government, which continue the previous year's funding rate and provisions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prorates funding to agencies on an annualized basis through apportionment. CRs may include anomalies or specific administrative changes. The first CR for FY2018 lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. The first CR for FY2018 extended funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for agriculture appropriations. Subsequent CRs (P.L. 115-90, P.L. 115-96, P.L. 115-120, P.L. 115-123) further extended funding deadlines, with waivers for PAYGO rules and budget caps raised for discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised budget caps for discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, amended farm bill provisions, and extended sequestration effects. It also included a six-week CR through March 23, 2018 and added $3.6 billion of disaster assistance in FY2018, including block grants for losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $2.36 billion in block grants to states for losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires. It also included funding for conservation, watershed recovery, rural water, and wastewater recovery. Additionally, the act added $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the current farm bill, with specific allocations for dairy programs, permanent disaster assistance, and cotton. The act offset some of these additions by extending sequestration on mandatory accounts under the Budget Control Act for two more years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated additional funding for various programs, including $2.36 billion in block grants for states affected by natural disasters. It also provided $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the farm bill, with specific allocations for dairy programs, disaster assistance, and cotton. The act raised the nondefense discretionary cap by $63 billion for FY2018 and increased the discretionary total for Agriculture to $23.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2017. The Agriculture appropriation for FY2018 is about $146 billion, with increases in spending for various programs. The General Provisions include additional funding for rural water programs, rural broadband expansion, Food for Peace foreign aid, and opioid enforcement. The Consolidated Appropriations Act also increases agricultural research spending and base funding for Food for Peace. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation increases funding for various programs, including Food for Peace by $134 million to $1.6 billion. Unlike previous years, there are fewer changes to mandatory program spending. The absence of usual CHIMPS costs about $740 million against the discretionary limit. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory goals. The Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. Sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts, with the FY2021 sunset extended multiple times to offset discretionary spending or other bills. Congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts multiple times, with the FY2021 sunset extended to FY2027 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Crop insurance is generally ruled exempt, while farm commodity programs and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts in agriculture continues in FY2018, with a 6.6% reduction rate. This results in a $1.3 billion reduction from authorized mandatory agriculture accounts.
