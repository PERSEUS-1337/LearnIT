    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children Act of 2011\" or the \"I Teach Act of 2011.\" The \"Incentives to Educate American Children Act of 2011\" highlights the decline in experienced teachers in classrooms and the positive impact of teaching experience on student achievement. It also addresses the challenges faced by rural school districts with lower salaries for starting teachers. The Education Trust study in 2009 revealed that high poverty schools have a higher percentage of uncertified teachers and first-year teachers compared to low poverty schools. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, established in 1987, aims to set high standards for accomplished teachers. Nearly 91,000 teachers nationwide have completed rigorous certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. A study by the National Research Council confirmed that students taught by certified teachers show higher achievement gains. Additionally, a recent Economic Policy Institute study found that public school teachers earn significantly less than other college graduates. The proposed Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through tax credits. The proposed Act aims to provide a tax credit to teachers who achieve certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers in public schools. The proposed Act introduces a tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. The proposed Act introduces a tax credit for eligible teachers in public schools with high poverty rates or in rural areas. The credit amount is $1,000 for teachers in these schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. The proposed Act introduces a tax credit for eligible teachers in public schools with high poverty rates or in rural areas. The credit amount is $1,000 for teachers in these schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. Eligible teachers must be certified and work full-time in kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms. Teachers meeting these criteria may receive an additional $2,000 credit. The section defines terms like \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also specifies that an eligible academic year ends in a taxable year starting after December 31, 2011. Additionally, there are conforming amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural areas and certified teachers applies to academic years ending after December 31, 2011."
