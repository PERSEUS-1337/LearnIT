The term \"nuclear weapon\" is defined as any device utilizing atomic energy for use as a weapon, prototype, or test device. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the threat of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear weapon is urgent and poses a significant risk to national and global security. Efforts to secure nuclear stockpiles and prevent nuclear smuggling have made progress, but more actions are necessary to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism. The White House's 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism highlights the grave danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan warns that a nuclear terror attack would have devastating consequences on a global scale. UN Security Council Resolution 1540 emphasizes the importance of combating this threat through all available means. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency emphasizes the urgent need to prevent terrorist attacks using nuclear weapons by adopting and enforcing effective laws prohibiting non-state actors from acquiring, developing, or using weapons of mass destruction for terrorist purposes. Sense of Congress on preventing nuclear terrorism. The sense of Congress is that the threat of nuclear terror is the most horrific the United States faces. A comprehensive approach is needed to reduce this danger, including efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, secure nuclear weapons worldwide, and prevent terrorist efforts to manufacture or transport nuclear explosives. The prevention of a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States should be a top priority. The President should accelerate programs to prevent nuclear terrorism, secure nuclear materials, and combat nuclear smuggling. The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital role in coordinating international efforts in this regard. Legislation sponsored by Senators Lugar, Domenici, and Nunn has led to groundbreaking programs to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear weapons. The National Security Act of 1947 is amended to include a new section for a senior advisor to the president for the prevention of nuclear terrorism.
