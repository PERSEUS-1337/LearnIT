PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, with separate reserve funds for each program. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, providing a maximum benefit to plan participants. Among participants in terminated multiemployer plans, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits exceeding it. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) made changes to PBGC's governance structures. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) underwent governance changes, including setting the Director's term at five years, requiring regular board meetings, and appointing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. PBGC is self-supporting, funded by premiums from private-sector employers, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded plans. Congress is hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC, as stated in ERISA. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is funded by premiums from private-sector pension plans. Sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer plans pay flat-rate and variable-rate premiums. In addition, sponsors of underfunded plans pay an extra premium based on underfunding amount. Terminated plans pay a per-participant premium for three years. Premiums for 2019 include a $80 annual fee per participant for single-employer plans, an additional $43 for underfunded plans, and a $1,250 per participant per year for terminated plans. The PBGC covers only qualified DB pension plans, not DC plans like 401(k)s. Qualified plans receive tax benefits under IRC Section 401, with employer contributions being tax-deductible. Participant income from the plan is taxed as ordinary income. To qualify under IRC, a pension plan must be intended as a permanent arrangement. The PBGC covers only qualified DB pension plans, not DC plans like 401(k)s. Qualified plans receive tax benefits under IRC Section 401, with employer contributions being tax-deductible. Participant income from the plan is taxed as ordinary income. To qualify under IRC, a pension plan must be intended as a permanent arrangement. Pension plans must provide determinable benefits, not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees, and cover a minimum number of employees. Excluded plans include governmental, church, and certain professional plans. PBGC operates single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs separately with separate reserve funds. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC does not become the trustee. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent pension plans that lack assets to pay participant benefits. Employers can terminate single-employer plans voluntarily, with PBGC and participants notified. PBGC may involuntarily terminate underfunded plans if the sponsor cannot meet pension obligations. If a company ends its pension plan voluntarily with sufficient assets to cover liabilities, PBGC confirms termination requirements but does not pay benefits to participants. Benefit liabilities include vested and nonvested benefits, early retirement supplements, and contingent benefits. When a pension plan terminates, assets cover benefit liabilities and may result in an asset reversion to the employer. The employer incurs a nondeductible excise tax on the reversion amount. If the plan is underfunded and terminates involuntarily, PBGC takes over as trustee, assumes liabilities, and makes benefit payments. PBGC makes payments for benefit liabilities promised under the plan with assets received from two sources: assets in the plan before termination and assets recovered from employers. If assets are insufficient, the employer can only terminate the plan under specific distress criteria related to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it has not met minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits when due, or has a substantial owner who received a large distribution. These requirements were added by SEPPAA and modified by subsequent acts to ensure that underfunded plan liabilities remain the employer's responsibility unless they meet strict financial need standards. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it cannot pay benefits when due, has a substantial owner who received a large distribution, or if the long-run loss to PBGC is expected to increase unreasonably. A federal court may also order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid unreasonable financial deterioration. PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans from FY1974 to FY2016, with only a small fraction resulting in claims against PBGC. Most terminations are standard, but after distress or involuntary termination, the plan's sponsor and controlled group members are liable to PBGC. The plan sponsor and their controlled group are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which is the liabilities minus assets at termination. Payment is typically in cash or securities, with a possible lien for non-payment. In cases of distress termination, PBGC's ability to recover assets may be limited if the sponsor is in bankruptcy. PBGC's benefit payments upon termination depend on various factors, including the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits and recoveries from the sponsor. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were vested at the time of plan termination, excluding certain benefits. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, with early retirement benefits also covered if they meet specific conditions. Contingent benefits are guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before plan termination, with a phased-in guarantee for certain benefits under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Maximum benefits for participants in single-employer pension plans are set by ERISA. The maximum pension guarantee for participants in single-employer pension plans is set by ERISA and adjusted annually for national wage growth. The maximum benefit is $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019, with adjustments based on when benefits are received and the form of payment. Examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefits are provided for different ages and payment options. The maximum pension guarantee for participants in single-employer pension plans is set by ERISA and adjusted annually for national wage growth. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid in a form other than a straight-life annuity depends on the type of benefit, survivor's benefit percentage, and age difference between participant and spouse. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 in FY2015. PBGC recipients in single-employer plans trusteed by PBGC received full benefits in over 80% of cases. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule, with some nonguaranteed benefits payable before certain guaranteed benefits. PBGC prioritizes paying benefits from plan assets before certain guaranteed benefits, such as those of participants receiving pension payments for over three years. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than termination, providing financial assistance when available resources are insufficient to cover benefits. If resources cannot support guaranteed benefits, PBGC may provide additional resources as a loan. PBGC provides additional resources as loans to multiemployer plans in insolvency, with rare repayments. Repayment terms are regulated, and only one plan has repaid assistance. Benefits are guaranteed up to a ceiling based on years of service and a specific formula. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants receiving financial assistance get their full benefit. Among plans that may require financial assistance in the future, only 49% of participants would receive their full benefit payment. The average benefit in ongoing plans is almost double that of terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for participants in plans receiving PBGC financial assistance. PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds. PBGC's main liabilities are future benefits payments in the single-employer program and financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program. PBGC has had an end of fiscal year deficit each year since FY2002, with the single-employer program showing a surplus in FY2018 due to increased premiums. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) faces a less than 1% chance of remaining solvent in FY2026. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. The single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, marking an improvement in its financial condition. The single-employer program's financial condition improved due to factors like investment income and increased premium income. In FY2018, 78 multiemployer plans received financial assistance, benefiting approximately 62,300 participants. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, but decreased to $53.8 billion in FY2018. The PBGC's budgetary cash flows are influenced by premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds. When PBGC takes over a pension plan, its assets are transferred to a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to other assets. The PBGC's trust fund investments totaled $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018, with assets allocated to equities and nonfixed income at 30% and fixed income at 70%. Three out of seven authorized revolving funds are used by PBGC, containing premiums from pension plan sponsors. Revolving funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with assets totaling $33.2 billion at the end of FY2018. These funds are on-budget accounts, with gross outlays covering benefit payments and administrative expenses. In its FY2017 Projections Report, PBGC estimated its financial condition over the next 10 years, projecting a likely deficit shrinkage for the single-employer program and insolvency for the multiemployer program by FY2025. Stakeholders criticize premium increases as federal revenue boosts that may not address PBGC's financial health and could deter employers from maintaining DB pension plans. The likely insolvency of large multiemployer pension plans could exhaust PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits, with a projected exposure of $53.8 billion. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustain through premium collections, improving PBGC's financial condition. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a committee to address concerns about the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The committee was supposed to make recommendations by November 30, 2018, but did not meet the deadline. Historical data on premium levels for both single-employer and multiemployer programs is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
