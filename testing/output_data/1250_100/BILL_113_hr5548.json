    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act\" and includes definitions for clarity. The Act, titled \"Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act,\" defines clean technology as energy production from renewable sources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage, building and industry energy efficiency, Smart Grid development, and advanced/sustainable material production for energy applications. The Act defines clean technology as energy production from renewable sources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage, building and industry energy efficiency, Smart Grid development, and advanced/sustainable material production for energy applications. Advanced manufacturing involves activities that utilize information, automation, computation, software, sensing, networking, cutting-edge materials, and emerging capabilities from physical or biological sciences like nanotechnology, chemistry, and biology. The Act defines clean technology as energy production from renewable sources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage, building and industry energy efficiency, Smart Grid development, and advanced/sustainable material production for energy applications. It also involves advanced manufacturing activities utilizing information, automation, computation, software, sensing, networking, cutting-edge materials, and capabilities from nanotechnology, chemistry, and biology. A cluster refers to a network of entities involved in clean technologies and advanced manufacturing, while a consortium is a clean technology consortium established under the Act to support projects by qualifying entities like research universities and Federal or State institutions. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce. Translational research involves coordinating basic or applied research with technical applications to enable discoveries to achieve commercial application. Establishment of Clean Technology Consortia Program. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote the development and deployment of state-of-the-art technologies for economic, environmental, and energy security. The program will leverage expertise from various sectors to support collaborative research, development, and commercial application of clean technologies. The Secretary will oversee all aspects of the program and select grant recipients for consortium establishment. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia through a competitive selection process to promote innovative technologies and coordinate activities with other federal agencies, industry, and institutions of higher education. The consortia will focus on developing new clean technologies for commercialization and expanding advanced manufacturing capabilities. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote innovative technologies and expand advanced manufacturing capabilities in clean technologies. This includes job creation, entrepreneurship, providing assistance to companies investing in clean technologies, addressing challenges, equipping small- and medium-sized enterprises with new technologies, and accelerating investment through partnerships. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote innovative technologies and expand advanced manufacturing capabilities in clean technologies. This includes job creation, entrepreneurship, providing assistance to companies investing in clean technologies, addressing challenges, equipping small- and medium-sized enterprises with new technologies, and accelerating investment through partnerships. Additionally, the initiative aims to encourage partnering between emerging and established clean technology and advanced manufacturing enterprises, and demonstrate a successful model for commercialization of clean technologies for promotion and emulation. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS. To receive a grant under this Act, a consortium must submit an application to the Secretary with necessary information. Eligibility criteria include having research universities with clean technology research budget and other qualifying entities with expertise in translational research and clean technology. The consortium must have a binding agreement outlining partnership structure, governance, conflicts-of-interest policy, and management structure. The consortium applying for a grant must have a conflicts-of-interest policy, an accounting structure meeting requirements, an external advisory committee, funding from non-Federal sources, be part of a cluster or show potential to develop one, and operate as a nonprofit organization or public-private partnership. The consortium must establish an external advisory committee with relevant expertise to review and ensure projects align with the conflicts-of-interest policy. The consortium must establish an external advisory committee with industry representatives, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists as deemed necessary. The Secretary will also join the advisory committee of a consortium receiving a grant under this Act. SEC. 5. GRANTS. The Secretary will award grants to consortia on a competitive basis for up to 5 years, extendable for another 5 years. The grant amount shall not exceed $30,000,000 per year or the total contributions from non-Federal entities. Factors considered include research capacity, resources, and consortium affiliation. Increases in grant amounts are possible within specified limits. A consortium can request an increase in grant amount when extending an initial grant under the Act. The grant must be used for translational research, technology development, manufacturing innovation, and commercialization activities related to clean technology. Consortiums must publicly share project plans, selection criteria, and prevent displacement of private sector investment. The consortium oversees project solicitations, reviews proposals, selects projects for awards, and monitors project implementation. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the awarded amounts. The consortium is limited to using no more than 10% of awarded amounts for administrative expenses and cannot use funds to construct new buildings. They must conduct annual audits to ensure compliance with the grant requirements, submit audit reports to the Secretary and Comptroller General, and allow full access to records for GAO review. The Secretary must provide Congress with an annual report on grant usage. The Secretary has the authority to review and revoke grants awarded under the clean technology consortia program if they are not used in accordance with the program requirements. Congress is provided with an annual report that includes audit copies and recommendations from the Secretary. $100,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section."
