    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with strict scrutiny being the most demanding form of review. This scrutiny raises the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Suspect classifications are based on race, national origin, and alienage. Strict scrutiny requires the government to prove that its actions are narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. Intermediate scrutiny is less demanding than strict scrutiny but more stringent than rational basis review, applying to quasi-suspect classifications. Intermediate scrutiny applies to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy. Courts review if the action is substantially related to an important government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity under intermediate scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least stringent, applying to classifications not under heightened scrutiny. Government action must be rationally related to a legitimate interest to pass rational basis review. Courts assess the legitimacy of any possible government purpose, and the action only needs to be a reasonable way to achieve it, not the most reasonable. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Supreme Court has interpreted this to include substantive guarantees that protect certain liberty interests. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights from undue governmental infringement, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. The government must show a compelling interest and narrowly tailor its actions to avoid unnecessary encumbrance on rights. The Supreme Court looks at historical recognition and necessity when determining fundamental rights. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges ruled that state same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, requiring states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages from other states. The decision was based on the fundamental right to marry, which the Court has long recognized as constitutionally protected. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and marriage's role in the nation's social order. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in recognizing same-sex couples' right to marry. The Supreme Court recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, departing from precedent and not applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court emphasized that rights evolve from a better understanding of constitutional imperatives and the urgency of liberty in the present era. The Supreme Court recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, departing from precedent and not applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court emphasized that rights evolve from a better understanding of constitutional imperatives and the urgency of liberty in the present era. The Court held that both equal protection and due process guarantees protect the fundamental right to marry, and that states can no longer deny this right to same-sex couples. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed that the majority exceeded the Court's proper role by removing the question of same-sex marriage from the democratic process. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell raised concerns about the majority's departure from precedent and the establishment of a fundamental right without historical roots. They questioned the Court's role in determining constitutional protections and raised various questions about the broader impact of the decision on gay rights and the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Obergefell decision focused on the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples, without addressing heightened scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. This decision had implications for gay individuals' rights, potentially subjecting government actions to judicial scrutiny based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth and Second Circuits consider it quasi-suspect, warranting intermediate scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit only applies rational basis review. The Obergefell decision, focusing on the right to marry for same-sex couples, did not clarify this circuit split, leaving it unresolved for future lower courts to address. The ambiguity in the level of scrutiny for laws based on sexual orientation could lead to differing outcomes in constitutional challenges. The Supreme Court's Obergefell decision also raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy. The Supreme Court's Obergefell decision raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting the possibility in his dissent. The majority's opinion in Obergefell aimed to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, but some believe its rationale could potentially be extended to plural marriages based on considerations of individual autonomy and family. The Obergefell decision departed from precedent by considering current views in addition to historical recognition when determining fundamental rights. This could expand the number of protected rights. The Court did not specify the level of scrutiny for state same-sex marriage bans, raising questions about future judicial review standards for government actions infringing on fundamental rights. The Obergefell decision expanded protected rights by considering current views, not just historical recognition. It did not specify the level of scrutiny for state same-sex marriage bans, raising questions about future judicial review standards for government actions infringing on fundamental rights. Regarding government interference with fundamental rights, the degree of permissibility is in question."
