    "content": "The \"Debt Buy-Down Act\" is designated for the reduction of public debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It introduces a new part for the designation of amounts for this purpose. The \"Debt Buy-Down Act\" allows individuals to designate up to 10% of their adjusted income tax liability to reduce the public debt. This designation must be made when filing tax returns and is effective for taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act. The \"Debt Buy-Down Act\" allows individuals to designate up to 10% of their adjusted income tax liability to reduce the public debt through the creation of the Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund\" is created in the Treasury of the United States to pay off federal government obligations included in the public debt. Amounts designated for public debt reduction are appropriated to the Trust Fund, and any obligations paid with these funds are canceled and retired. The amendment establishes the \"Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund\" to pay off federal government obligations in the public debt. Amounts received after the enactment of the Act will be used for this purpose. Additionally, a new section is added for sequestration to reduce the public debt under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Sequestration will occur within 15 days after Congress adjourns, equivalent to the estimated aggregate amount designated under the Internal Revenue Code for the last taxable year. This sequestration is modified by any reductions in discretionary spending and deficit changes resulting from direct spending legislation enacted after the date of enactment. The sequestration will occur within 15 days after Congress adjourns, based on the estimated aggregate amount designated under the Internal Revenue Code for the last taxable year. Direct spending legislation enacted after the date of enactment may result in reductions in discretionary spending and deficit changes. Accounts of the United States will be reduced by a calculated dollar amount to carry out the sequestration, with exemptions for certain accounts. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 may reduce benefits to the Social Security Act and uniformed services, as well as payments for net interest. Section 254 is amended to include new reporting requirements. The Department of the Treasury is required to report to Congress on the estimated amount of income tax designated for sequestration to reduce the public debt under section 6097 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Additionally, there are new reporting requirements for sequestration to reduce the public debt outlined in subsection (c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Department of the Treasury must report to Congress on the income tax designated for sequestration to reduce the public debt. New reporting requirements for sequestration to reduce the public debt are outlined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 outlines new reporting requirements for sequestration to reduce the public debt, with amendments ceasing after the first fiscal year without public debt."
