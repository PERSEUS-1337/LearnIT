    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress acknowledges the lack of a health care program for pre-1956 retired uniformed service members and the misleading information provided to service members regarding fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement. The availability of medical care for retired uniformed service members has been limited, especially for those under the age of 65. Despite some extensions to the TRICARE program, access to healthcare remains a challenge. The United States should fulfill its promises to provide high-quality healthcare for all retired service members. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM. The amendment to Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code, allows for health care coverage for retirees and dependents through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Eligible beneficiaries include members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, and dependents of deceased members. Eligible beneficiaries, including members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, and dependents of deceased members, may enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan for self-only or self and family coverage. They are not required to meet eligibility criteria specified in chapter 89 of title 5, except as provided in specific circumstances. Eligible beneficiaries, including members of the uniformed services, may enroll in Federal Employees Health Benefits plans without meeting chapter 89 eligibility criteria. Beneficiaries can change plans and coverage, and those enrolled are not eligible for health care under other specified sections. Military medical treatment facilities can be reimbursed for services provided to beneficiaries. The Government contribution for eligible beneficiaries enrolling in health benefits plans under chapter 89 of title 5 is limited. Separate risk pools must be maintained for premium rate establishment. The Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries for health care expenses under TRICARE Standard. The Government contribution for eligible beneficiaries enrolling in health benefits plans under chapter 89 of title 5 is limited. The Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries for health care expenses under TRICARE Standard. Chapter 89 is amended to allow reimbursement for health care costs not covered by the health benefits plan. The amendments made by this section will provide health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program starting on October 1, 2010. Additionally, military retirees and dependents in hardship cases will receive reimbursement for TRICARE pharmacy benefits at TRICARE network pharmacy levels. The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if certified by a physician due to access constraints. Eligible individuals are beneficiaries with primary coverage under another health insurance plan."
