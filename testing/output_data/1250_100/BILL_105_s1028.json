    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to manage Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct a pilot project to demonstrate the effectiveness of resource management activities outlined in the proposal. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a pilot project in designated Federal lands in California as per the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. Spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers within the pilot project area will be excluded from resource management activities and timber harvesting during the project. During the pilot project in designated Federal lands in California, all road building and timber harvesting activities are prohibited in certain areas. Riparian protection guidelines apply to resource management and timber harvesting activities within the project area. During the pilot project on designated Federal lands in California, resource management activities must comply with guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl as outlined in specific documents. Resource management activities on Federal lands in the pilot project area include fuelbreak construction, group selection, and individual tree selection to achieve fire-resilient forests. Fuelbreak construction involves strategic zones using thinning and other methods on 40,000-60,000 acres annually. Group selection and individual tree selection are used to manage forests for all-age, multistory conditions. In the pilot project area, individual tree selection may be utilized, with a total acreage limit of 70,000 acres per year. Riparian management, including wide protection zones and restoration projects, is required. The Secretary must use cost-effective means for resource management activities and funding must comply with relevant guidelines. The Secretary will implement resource management activities in accordance with the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal using excess funds allocated for the administration and management of specific national forests. The pilot project prohibits the use of funds from other units of the National Forest System and allows flexibility for forest supervisors to allocate and use excess funds for resource management activities. The Secretary will implement resource management activities using excess funds allocated for specific national forests. Restrictions apply to the use of funds to ensure other activities are not limited. Overhead costs are limited to 12%, with at least 88% for required activities. Additional funds may be appropriated as needed. Baseline funding levels must be maintained for resource management activities. The Secretary will conduct a pilot project for a specified period, consulting with the Quincy Library Group. The Forest Service may use private contracts for project requirements. The Regional Forester will amend forest management plans within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The pilot project in the Tahoe National Forest will incorporate the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal and other necessary changes. The Secretary will provide annual reports to Congress on the project's progress and fund usage. The annual report to Congress on the pilot project in the Tahoe National Forest includes a complete accounting of fund usage, total acres treated for various resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues generated and costs incurred. The annual report on the pilot project in the Tahoe National Forest includes a schedule for resource management activities, a description of environmental impacts, and a limitation on expenditures. A final report will assess the effectiveness of the pilot project in meeting its goals, including watershed monitoring. The pilot project in the Tahoe National Forest includes watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and a submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002. The pilot project is not exempt from any Federal environmental law."
