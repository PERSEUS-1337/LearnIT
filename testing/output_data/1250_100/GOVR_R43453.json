    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for a 10-year period once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount varies by year and technology, with wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualifying for the highest amount. Other technologies receive a reduced credit. Construction start dates determine eligibility for the credit. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2020, with reductions for later start dates. The PTC has not been phased out due to electricity market prices not exceeding threshold levels. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), but unused credits could be carried forward. The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) from 2009 to 2017. There are also production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific requirements for eligibility and credit amounts. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Since then, it has been extended multiple times, with various technologies being added as qualifying for the credit. The base credit amount for refined coal is $4.375 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $7.307 per ton in 2018. Facilities must have been in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits, which can be received over a 10-year period. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through December 31, 2005 by the Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-311) and later modified by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357). New qualifying resources were added, with a five-year PTC period for open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. The AJCA also introduced a PTC for refined coal at a rate of $4.375 per ton. The PTC was extended twice during the 109th Congress, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) extending it for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, through 2007, and adding hydropower and Indian coal as new qualifying resources. EPACT05 added hydropower and Indian coal as new qualifying resources for the Production Tax Credit (PTC). Hydropower received a half-credit, while Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period. The PTC period was extended to 10 years for facilities placed in service after August 8, 2005. The PTC was further extended through various acts, including the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, with modifications and extensions for different qualifying resources such as wind, refined coal, biomass, geothermal energy, and steel industry fuel. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits for property placed in service in 2009 or 2010. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the PTC for wind through 2013 and changed the credit expiration date. The PTC and ITC options were extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through 2016. Indian coal facilities also had their production credit extended through 2016. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2019, with reductions for facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was retroactively extended for tax year 2017 but will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Cost estimates can be found in the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) annual tax expenditure tables. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates annual tax expenditure for the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy and other sources. Between 2018 and 2022, the estimated revenue losses for PTC are $25.8 billion, with most of it attributed to wind energy. Other sources include geothermal, biomass, municipal solid waste, and hydropower. The tax expenditure estimates are based on current law and could increase with further PTC extensions. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the PTC, mainly for renewable electricity production. In 2013, taxpayers claimed $2.8 billion in Production Tax Credits (PTCs) for renewable electricity. Unused credits can be carried forward to offset tax liability in future years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected PTC claims, with fewer taxpayers claiming the credit after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. These grants totaled $15.5 billion for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn impacted PTC claims as taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits. Tax credit carry forwards doubled between 2008 and 2010. Weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy developers to monetize tax credits. Estimates show that extending the PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the wind construction start date would reduce federal revenues by $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, with a 1999 sunset clause for assessment. Congress extended the PTC in 1999 to support wind and other renewable resources, believing it contributes to environmental goals. Research shows the PTC drives investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions are seen as windfall benefits. While the PTC increases renewable energy use, its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is unclear. Research on the contribution of renewable electricity to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Tax credits for wind and solar energy have been found to help reduce emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is often justified by the presence of externalities, such as pollution, which lead to market failures. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option to address these inefficiencies. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are not the most efficient way to address inefficiencies in the energy sector. They reduce the average cost of energy, counter energy conservation efforts, and may not provide equal incentives for emissions reduction alternatives. A more effective approach would be a direct tax on pollution, like a carbon tax, which could generate revenue to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. This approach would be technology-neutral and avoid the need for Congress to select which technologies to subsidize. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy developers. Project developers often rely on tax equity financing arrangements to monetize tax benefits. Production-based incentives are more effective in promoting renewable electricity. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies. Without legislative action, the PTC is not available for nonwind projects after December 31, 2017. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) may expire for nonwind projects that began construction after December 31, 2017, or wind projects after December 31, 2019. Options include allowing the PTC to expire as scheduled, providing a temporary extension, or extending it for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018. Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout in 2014 as part of a tax reform proposal. Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout in his tax reform proposal, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh. The proposal aimed to raise $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC with additional provisions. The PTC and ITC for renewable energy would be made permanent, with additional provisions such as making solar property eligible for the PTC. The changes are estimated to cost $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
