    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2008\". The Federal Government aims to enhance its public alert and warning system by utilizing various technologies to provide timely and effective warnings of disasters. This modernization effort includes improving security, survivability, redundancy, remote notification capabilities, geographically targeted alerts, and the ability for individuals to request specific warnings. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System is being modernized to enhance the timely and effective warnings of disasters. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act is amended to modernize the integrated public alert and warning system for timely disaster warnings. The President, through FEMA, will ensure alerts reach authorities and the public in disaster-prone areas. The public alert and warning system, under the Directorate's responsibility, will establish common protocols, adapt communications based on location and risks, alert individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency, and conduct training and tests. The public alert and warning system must incorporate multiple communication technologies, adapt to future technologies, reach the largest portion of the population, promote partnerships for preparedness, and provide redundant alert mechanisms. Pilot programs will be conducted to demonstrate these requirements. The Director will conduct pilot programs to demonstrate the feasibility of various methods for meeting system requirements. A report will be submitted to Congress assessing the effectiveness of the pilot programs and recommending additional authority to continue or make them permanent. The Director will implement pilot programs to demonstrate system feasibility and submit a detailed plan to Congress within 6 months. $37,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009 with additional appropriations as needed. No impact on Department of Commerce or Federal Communications Commission authority."
