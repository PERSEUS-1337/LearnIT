    "content": "The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires priority for SCHIP coverage of children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" mandates the inclusion of income-related data in annual reports to assess the success of states in providing health insurance for children at different income levels. The Secretary will establish standards for data collection and statistical methods by September 30, 2009. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires states to develop and implement a plan to ensure coverage of low-income children by creditable health insurance starting from fiscal year 2010. The Secretary will review and approve these plans promptly. The Secretary will approve or disapprove state plans for low-income children's health coverage based on their design. If a plan is disapproved, the state can resubmit a modified plan. The Secretary will notify the state promptly of the decision. Qualified low-income children are defined as those whose family income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line. The amendment limits the use of SCHIP funds by states that increase their income eligibility levels above the current threshold. Payment will not be made for individuals whose family income exceeds the new eligibility level unless the state proves to the Secretary that no more than 10 percent of the funds are used for these individuals. The amendment restricts SCHIP funds for states raising income eligibility levels. Payment won't cover individuals above the new threshold unless the state proves to the Secretary that less than 10% of funds are used for them."
