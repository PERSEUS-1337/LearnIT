    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or public health and safety risks. Protections for IC whistleblowers only apply to lawful disclosures that follow prescribed reporting procedures to protect classified information. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) do not cover differences of opinion on policy or strategy unless there are concerns over legality. Protections also do not shield against legitimate adverse personnel actions if the agency can show it would have taken the same steps without the disclosure. Procedures for making protected disclosures are defined by Congress and the executive branch, with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) providing guidance. There are debates on the transparency of IC processes and the adequacy of protections for contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998 was the first legislation specific to the IC, providing a process for complaints but no specific protections. Subsequent measures like PPD-19 in 2012 and ICD-120 in 2014 aimed to address vulnerabilities of IC whistleblowers to reprisals. Whistleblower protections for members of the Armed Forces in the IC are covered under 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 and DOD Directive 7050.06. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118 amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. It allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. This provision aims to improve the flow of information needed for oversight responsibilities. The ICWPA defines formal processes for submitting complaints to ensure protection of classified information. It requires the IG to report credible complaints to the CIA Director or head of the establishment, who must then report to congressional intelligence committees. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can submit complaints directly to Congress. However, the ICWPA lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection. The IAA for FY2010 established whistleblower protection legislation within the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC), allowing lawful disclosures to the IGIC regarding violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or public health and safety risks. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC) has the authority to investigate complaints or disclosures made by employees or contractors of the intelligence community. Reprisals for making complaints or disclosures are prohibited unless they are knowingly false or made with willful disregard for the truth. Contractors are also covered under this provision. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community can investigate complaints or disclosures from intelligence community employees or contractors. Protections against reprisals for lawful disclosures were clarified by Section 425(d) of the IAA for FY2010 and PPD-19 signed by President Obama in 2012. PPD-19 specifically protects IC employees with access to classified information from reprisals for making lawful disclosures. PPD-19 prohibits reprisals against Intelligence Community employees for making protected disclosures of violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. It also requires IC elements to certify a process for employees to seek review of personnel actions believed to be reprisals. The Inspector General determines if a personnel action was in reprisal and recommends corrective action if a violation occurred. The agency head must consider the Inspector General's findings and recommendations, but does not have to accept them. Employees can appeal actions related to access to classified information, and whistleblowers can request an external review by an IG panel. The IGIC reports annually to Congress on determinations and recommendations. Training on whistleblower protections is required for employees with access to classified information. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) provided statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against reprisals for lawful disclosures to specified entities, but did not specifically mention protections for contractors. Section 602 of Title VI offers protections for government employee whistleblowers against retaliatory revocation of security clearance for lawful disclosures. It includes appeal policies and procedures for whistleblower security clearance decisions. ICD-120 provides IC implementing guidance for PPD-19, offering protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures. It excludes members of the Armed Forces and contractors. The curr_chunk discusses protections for whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community, including provisions for appeals, maintaining employment status during pending decisions, and external review panels. It also mentions Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code, which provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliatory actions. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces to communicate with various entities, specifies prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for protected communication, enables the DOD to mitigate hardship for members facing reprisal, and requires periodic updates during investigations. The IC whistleblower protection legislation covers contractors inconsistently, with gaps in coverage identified. Efforts in Congress have been made to address this, including the passage of P.L. 115-118 in 2018 to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 in 2017 to provide protections for IC employees, but no further action was taken. The bill introduced by Senator McCaskill aimed to extend protections for IC contractor employees who make whistleblower complaints, including safeguarding classified information in court actions. Congress later passed P.L. 115-118 in 2018, amending existing whistleblower protections for IC contractors. Section 110 of the bill provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, including violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health. These protections are similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014. Section 110 of the bill extends protections to IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, including violations of federal laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health. H.Amdt. 894 redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC, enhancing the ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse."
