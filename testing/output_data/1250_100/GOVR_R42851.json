    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Courts granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting the Act may violate due process. The PACT Act requires remote retailers to pay state and local taxes before delivering tobacco products. Courts have granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting potential violations of the Due Process Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld an injunction in Red Earth, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will review the injunction in Gordon. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, a federal district court rejected a due process argument, stating that the PACT Act is a federal statute requiring compliance with state laws and does not implicate due process. The court also found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with the jurisdictions it shipped tobacco products to through its website. The Supreme Court has emphasized that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The constitutionality of the PACT Act depends on minimum contacts for remote retailers. The Supreme Court has stated that minimum contacts involve purposefully availing oneself of an economic market in a state. Due process requires that taxes paid must be related to values connected with the taxing state. The PACT Act aims to enforce laws on remote sellers of tobacco products. The PACT Act requires sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with all applicable laws, including taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. It also mandates remote sellers to pay all taxes that apply to sales in the buyer's locality before delivery. The PACT Act mandates sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with all applicable laws, including taxes, and apply required stamps to indicate tax payment. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. Remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, which is analyzed separately from the Commerce Clause. In Quill, the Court considered whether North Dakota could require an out-of-state retailer to collect a use tax. The retailer argued that physical presence was needed to satisfy minimum contacts. The Court cited Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to support jurisdiction over out-of-state businesses, stating that physical presence is not always necessary in modern commercial transactions. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected the idea that physical presence is necessary for personal jurisdiction across state lines. In Quill, the Court found that directing activities towards residents of another State satisfies the minimum contacts requirement. The issue is whether the out-of-state business has purposefully directed its activities at the taxing state and has fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians sought to block enforcement of the PACT Act's tax requirements on their tobacco sales. The plaintiffs challenged the PACT Act, arguing it violates the Due Process Clause by imposing taxes without sufficient minimum contacts. The United States contended that maintaining websites and shipping goods into taxing jurisdictions satisfied minimum contacts. However, the court found issues with this argument, noting that not all plaintiffs have websites and that the websites are passive with no ability to complete purchases online. The court determined that a passive website alone does not establish minimum contacts for tax collection. It rejected the argument that a single sale creates sufficient contacts, citing previous cases that support the opposite view. The court ruled that a single sale does not establish sufficient contacts for tax collection, emphasizing the importance of minimum contacts. The PACT Act was found to violate the Due Process Clause by broadening jurisdictional reach without regard to constitutional constraints. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was appealed by the government to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The issue at hand was whether Congress can require vendors to submit to the taxing jurisdiction of any state. The court upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a vendor to collect state and local taxes based on a single delivery. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale is sufficient for due process. Musser's case involved a tobacco retailer with business in all 50 states through a website and phone. The plaintiff in Musser's sought a preliminary injunction on the ground that the PACT Act requires retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions, violating the Due Process Clause. The district court denied the injunction, stating that Congress, not the states, imposes the tax-payment requirement, and federal legislation requires interstate businesses to comply with state and local laws. The court's analysis upheld federal requirements for interstate businesses to comply with state and local laws. It also determined that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website. The court applied the sliding scale approach to establish personal jurisdiction based on online business activities. Personal jurisdiction over the Internet is proper when a defendant actively conducts business through an interactive website, allowing users to exchange information and make purchases online. The court's analysis in Musser's case concluded that selling products and conducting business online in multiple states establishes minimum contacts for jurisdiction. The court's reasoning suggests that minimum contacts can be satisfied by a single sale through an interactive website. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, stating that the motion was timely and addressing the government's argument on Due Process violations. The Supreme Court distinguishes between Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects in Gordon's claims, stating that national legislation cannot violate Due Process principles. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the U.S., not individual states, and each tobacco sale satisfies minimum contacts with a state. The government argued that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers regarding state and local taxes, which differs from previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected this argument, emphasizing that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause in regulating interstate commerce. The Musser's court collapsed the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the PACT Act challenge, following the D.C. Circuit's rejection of the government's argument. The court reviewed key due process cases on personal jurisdiction, emphasizing the need for minimum contacts with the jurisdiction. It cited Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, stating that jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are directed towards residents of another state. The court emphasized that jurisdiction is proper when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum State. The defendant's deliberate engagement in significant activities within a State or creating continuing obligations with residents establishes jurisdiction. The focus is on foreseeability, where the defendant should reasonably anticipate being sued in that forum. The Supreme Court emphasized that a single act creating a substantial connection with the forum can support jurisdiction. Acts with only a weak affiliation are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation. The district court discussed Quill's due process challenge, emphasizing the need for a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax. Quill's mail order business had sufficient contacts with North Dakota to meet due process requirements, as it purposefully directed activities at residents and benefited from access to the state. The district court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon's case, as his business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market of the states where he sold products. The court also questioned the rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing state. It was unclear what benefits Gordon received from the state aside from the fact that his buyer resided there, leading to a potential violation of due process by the PACT Act. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process by subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may have conflated the Commerce Clause and due process analyses, but it is unclear if the PACT Act complies with due process requirements. Higher courts may question if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the due process requirement of minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considers this a \"close question.\""
