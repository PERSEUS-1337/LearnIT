    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. The Voting Restoration Act aims to restore voting rights by addressing disparities in voting eligibility for ex-felons across different states. Congress asserts its supervisory power over federal elections and highlights the importance of ensuring voting rights for all citizens. Approximately 2 percent of the adult population, or 3,900,000 Americans, are unable to vote due to felony convictions. The number of incarcerated individuals has increased significantly, with drug offenders making up a large portion of the prison population. In some states, federal offenders must obtain a Presidential pardon to regain their voting rights. Approximately one-third of women in prison are incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses, with African-Americans disproportionately affected by racially disparate sentencing laws. Minorities, particularly African-American men, are disproportionately impacted by laws that strip felons of their right to vote. Congress should address these discrepancies to ensure all Americans have the right to vote in Federal elections. The purpose of this Act is to restore voting eligibility to individuals who have completed sentences for criminal offenses. The Act aims to restore voting rights to individuals who have served sentences for criminal offenses and encourage their involvement in community life. The Act aims to protect the right to vote and register to vote in federal elections. The Act protects the voting rights of individuals with felony convictions, allowing restrictions only during custody or supervision. It also allows for a private right of action if violations occur, with a process for correction within specified timeframes. The Act allows individuals with felony convictions to protect their voting rights, with the option for a private civil action in court for violations occurring close to election dates. The Attorney General can also take legal action to address any necessary remedies. The Act allows for declaratory or injunctive relief to remedy violations, with the option for private civil action or legal action by the Attorney General. Grant program to assist states in protecting rights of ex-felons to vote and register in federal elections.

This program aims to provide information on eligibility to vote, increase voter registration rates, and states must meet specific requirements to receive grants. The Attorney General establishes a grant program to help States protect voting rights of felons in federal elections. States must apply with required information and assurances, and the grant amount is based on the number of felons in the State compared to all eligible States. Each State receiving a grant under the program must provide information to felons regarding their voting rights and eligibility through a program that includes maintaining an index of felons under state custody or supervision. The State must inform individuals about their voting rights and eligibility, including those engaged in plea bargaining or convicted of a felony.

The program aims to reduce the number of felonies leading to the loss of voting rights. Each State receiving a grant under the program must establish an index of eligible felons to increase voter registration rates among them. The program aims to reduce felonies leading to disenfranchisement. The program aims to increase voter registration rates among individuals convicted of felonies by at least 50% over a 5-year period. States must also work to increase the voting participation of these individuals in elections by collaborating with public and private entities that provide services to felons. States receiving grants under the program must report activities to the Attorney General, including the number of convicted felons registered to vote and voting percentages.
