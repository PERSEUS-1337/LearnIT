    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account, supporting neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. This represents 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested by the agency for FY2013. The budget proposal would increase funding for CDF account activities by 4.5% or $135 million, reinstating funding for the regional planning initiative and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) and transfers $35 million for Section 4 capacity building activities to the CDF account. Funding for CDBG formula grants remains unchanged at $2.948.1 billion, with $2.059 billion for entitlement communities, $882 million for state-administered programs, and $7 million for insular areas. Additionally, $60 million is requested for Indian tribes, similar to FY2012 appropriations. The budget also recommends reinstating funding for SCI program activities. The Administration's FY2013 budget recommends reinstating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) program activities with a request for an appropriation of $100 million. The funds would support SCI's three components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants, totaling $92 million. These grants aim to promote sustainable growth in metropolitan areas by integrating planning requirements across various disciplines. The Administration's FY2013 budget recommends reinstating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative program with a request for $100 million. The funds would support Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and a Housing-Transportation Integration Research initiative. Additionally, $3 million would be set aside for technical support for energy efficiency improvements in housing. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to use their annual CDBG allocation to attract private capital for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. Communities can borrow up to five times their allocation for 20 years through bond issuance. The program aims to support job creation and meet CDBG program goals, benefiting low to moderate-income individuals and addressing community needs. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million to $500 million in FY2013. The Administration proposes increasing funding for the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program to help local governments finance job creation activities. The proposal includes charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers and increasing the loan commitment ceiling. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is a 5% increase from the previous year, excluding disaster-related funding. The bill also supports $60 million in funding for Indian tribes. The Senate committee bill for FY2012 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. It recommends $50 million for SCI activities, half of the Administration's request. The bill also proposes converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. Additionally, it recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program from its current account. The House bill, H.R. 5972, recommends $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation. The bill does not support the Administration's request for a new round of funding for SCI activities and recommends $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previous awards. It also does not support converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure. H.R. 5972 recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million and continues funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The House debated amendments to reduce funding for CDBG and Section 108 programs, but none were approved. During the budget debate for FY2012, several amendments to eliminate funding for various programs were defeated by Congress. A point of order was sustained for an amendment seeking to change existing law. The focus was on reducing federal spending while supporting activities for job creation to address high unemployment rates. Supporters of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program highlighted its role in supporting state activities. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget, reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, and transferring SCI to a new account. The total funding level recommended was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations. The FY2012 budget proposed an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities, totaling $3.684 billion. Additional funding requests included $7 million for insular areas, $65 million for Indian tribes, $25 million for Rural Innovation Grants, and $23 million for Guam. The budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants. The Administration's FY2012 budget recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with an appropriation of $150 million. Funds would support Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2011 to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The proposal included charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers and eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected the proposal and the House Appropriations Subcommittee recommended $3.501 billion for CDF activities in a draft bill for FY2012. The subcommittee-approved draft bill for FY2012 recommended maintaining overall CDF appropriations at the FY2011 funding level. The draft report noted a recommendation to eliminate the program in the FY2012 Budget Resolution. While the report did not eliminate funding for the CDBG program, it suggested that states and local communities should use more of their own taxes for community development activities. Funding priorities would shift, including eliminating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes. The subcommittee also rejected the Administration's proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The bill recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees with $6.8 million in credit subsidies to support $275 million in loan guarantees. It also proposed lowering the ceiling on funds grantees could use for administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of their CDBG allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a substantial reduction in CDF funding to $3.0 billion for FY2012, excluding $400 million for CDBG supplemental disaster assistance. This was $500 million less than FY2011 appropriations and $280.4 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate bill recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate appropriations measures into a Minibus bill, which was approved by the Senate. Senator Coburn's amendment, S.Amdt. 796, aimed to prohibit the use of grants for repaying federal loans. The amendment aims to prevent CDBG funds from being used to repay federal loans, specifically impacting the Section 108 loan guarantee program. The House and Senate reconciled differences in H.R. 2112 through a conference report, leading to the approval of the bill and its signing into law as P.L. 112-55. This law allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, with $300 million designated for CDBG disaster activities. The $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 was 10.7% less than in FY2011, reflecting congressional efforts to reduce federal spending. Other CDF activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative were not directly funded, but could be carried out using CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. P.L. 112-55 did not include provisions to prohibit the use of CDBG funds to repay federal loans or reduce the percentage of CDBG funds. The House recommended reducing CDBG funds for administrative expenses from 20% to 10%. The act mandated a study by the GAO on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME programs. HUD was required to submit a progress report on grantee accountability within 120 days. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported. $5.952 million in credit was appropriated for the program. P.L. 112-55 appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for Section 108 loan guarantees and included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. Funds were to be used for disaster relief, long-term recovery plans, housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Eligible states and local governments had to submit a disaster recovery plan to receive funds. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 appropriated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a provision exempting $100 million from discretionary spending limits. Grantees could seek waivers of CDBG program requirements for recovery efforts. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a provision exempting $100 million from discretionary spending limits. The CDF, including the Community Development Block Grant program, faced significant budget reductions in earlier legislative proposals. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill for FY2011 aimed to reduce funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion below the Obama Administration's request. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill for FY2011 aimed to reduce funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion below the Obama Administration's request. After negotiations, President Obama signed P.L. 112-10, allocating $3.508 billion for the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The P.L. 112-10 appropriation of $3.501 billion for the CDF account includes a 0.2% mandatory across the board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This reduces the CDF account by $7 million and moves $35 million to the Transformation Initiative. The FY2011 appropriation is 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than the Administration's request. The FY2011 appropriation for the CDF account is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. It includes funding for the CDBG program, which provides grants to various entities. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for the Sustainable Communities Initiative by 33%. H.R. 1 would have significantly reduced the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 funding level. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. It did not specify how funds should be allocated among different components of the CDBG program. Senator Inouye's amendment, S.Amdt. 149, which was defeated, proposed $4.230 billion for CDF activities. The Senate bill proposed $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion allocated for the CDBG program. The CDBG formula grant funds would have been frozen at the FY2010 level, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. Funding for various programs would have remained at FY2010 levels. However, funding for formula-based components of the CDBG program decreased from $3.943 billion in FY2010 to $2.942 billion in FY2012, leading to a decline in average grant amounts for entitlement communities. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. This decrease is due to lower appropriations and an increase in qualifying communities. State allocations also decreased by 25.4% during the same period. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted community and economic development plans, forcing delays or cancellations of activities supporting job creation and public services. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program in H.R. 1 would have affected non-profit organizations serving as sub-grantees, managing various public services. Supporters argue that the reduction disproportionately impacts low and moderate income households. The FY2012 appropriations for the program are the lowest in over a decade, leading to delays in projects and reduced support for entitlement communities. The table provides state-level information on CDBG allocations, with reductions in funding for FY2011 and FY2012. 70% of funds go to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% is allocated to nonentitlement communities. CDBG funds are distributed to eligible entitlement communities and states using two formulas, Formula A and Formula B. Formula A allocates funds based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors, while Formula B considers population growth lag factor for metropolitan cities and urban counties. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system, with Formula A using population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors, and Formula B considering population growth lag factor for metropolitan cities and urban counties. HUD is required to use the most recent data from the Census Bureau and OMB for allocations. Starting from FY2012, Census data will be used for HUD allocations. Starting from FY2012, HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates for CDBG fund allocations. The ACS estimates will be updated annually to reflect demographic changes more accurately. Prior to FY2012, HUD used 2000 Decennial Census data. In December 2011, HUD released a study on the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data on CDBG formula grant funds allocation. The HUD study analyzed the impact of changing data sources on CDBG fund allocations. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw declines in funding, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions experienced increases. Principal cities and urban counties received a larger share of funds, while other entitlement cities saw a decrease. These changes were driven by shifts in poverty and overcrowding demographics. The report analyzes changes in CDBG fund allocations, with urban counties seeing increased poverty shares and principal cities receiving more funding. New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest funding declines due to decreased poverty and overcrowding shares. The report also discusses the CDF account's funding history and components from FY2000 to FY2011. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between $5.112 billion for FY2001. The FY2011 appropriation for CDF activities is the lowest in over a decade, with funding levels for the CDBG-formula component being a focus of debate. Supporters argue for increased funding due to declining appropriations in both current and constant dollars, exacerbated by more communities gaining entitlement status. Critics question the justification for increased funding based on the program's PART score and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to address the federal budget deficit. The average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined from $3 million in FY2002 to $2.1 million in FY2008, but increased to $2.4 million in FY2010. However, in FY2011, the average allocation dropped to $1.9 million, 34.5% less than in FY2000. The number of entitlement communities receiving direct allocation increased from 1,012 to 1,167 from FY2000 to FY2011. In FY2010, the average annual grant amount awarded to states for nonentitlement communities was $1.183 billion, a decrease from $1.271 billion in FY2000 but an increase from FY2009. The average state allocation fluctuated from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before rising to $23.2 million in FY2010. However, in FY2011, the average state allocation dropped to $19.1 million, 23.3% less than in FY2000 and 17.7% less than in FY2010. Program funding in inflation-adjusted constant dollars decreased by 40% from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants varied between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in current dollars over the last decade. The Community Development Fund (CDF) includes various programs with smaller appropriations and specific objectives. Some programs are meant to complement the larger CDBG formula grant program, while others serve different agency goals or earmarked projects. Funding for set-aside programs in the CDF fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with Congress appropriating varying amounts each year. In FY2010, a significant portion of the $509 million allocated for CDF set-asides went to Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI) earmark accounts. In FY2011, Congress eliminated funding for the EDI and NI earmarked accounts within the Community Development Fund (CDF). The appropriations for CDF set-asides fluctuated due to Congress's decisions to move categorical grant programs in or out of the CDF account, reduce funding for specific programs, and determine funding for programs like EDI and NI. Earmarked projects funded by EDI and NI programs were dominant in CDBG-related set aside appropriations from FY2000 to FY2011. Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account during the FY2007 appropriations cycle, leading to new rules governing disclosure of earmark requests. Since FY2007, EDI and NI earmarks have been included in subsequent legislation appropriating funds for CDF activities. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the dominant components of CDBG-linked set asides programs, with appropriations twice the amount for other set-aside activities combined. However, for FY2011, Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has used the CDBG program's administrative framework to provide supplemental funds for disaster relief and recovery efforts. The government provided funds for disaster relief and recovery efforts after events like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, as well as to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis and job creation during the economic recession. Funding was allocated to states and communities meeting specific criteria, with Congress deciding on supplemental funds for disaster areas. The disaster necessitates additional CDBG funds beyond FEMA's typical allocation. Funds from NSP-1 and NSP-3 were distributed to states based on mortgage-related criteria. States were required to allocate a portion of these funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage issues. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure programs on March 2, 2011. On March 9, 2011, the committee approved H.R. 861 with an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of NSP program termination on its website. The notice directs citizens to contact their representatives about foreclosure impacts. During the March 2, 2011, subcommittee hearing, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and wasteful. He argued for rescinding funding due to the need to reduce federal debt. However, other Members defended the program, citing its success in helping communities combat the impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. HUD's Assistant Secretary stated that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties and support over 93,000 jobs nationwide. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182, impacting over 93,000 jobs nationwide."
