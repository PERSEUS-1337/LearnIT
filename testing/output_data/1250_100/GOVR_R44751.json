    "content": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides federal funding to states for cash assistance programs to families with children in need. TANF replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program in 1996, with a focus on moving single mothers from welfare to work. The TANF block grant aims to end needy parents' dependence on government benefits by promoting job preparation and work. It enforces this goal through the work participation standard. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve goals such as assisting needy families, reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and promoting two-parent families. In FY2015, $31.7 billion in federal TANF funds and state funds were used for a variety of benefits, services, and activities beyond cash assistance. Basic assistance accounted for $7.8 billion, work program expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, and the remaining funds were spent on activities supporting work and social services like child care and early childhood education. TANF funds are used for a wide range of activities beyond cash assistance, including supporting families with children, child care expenditures, and refundable tax credits for working families. The program is not a single entity but a funding stream that serves families at risk of abuse and neglect, with a focus on those who are already employed. The TANF program provides funding to multiple state-level programs offering various benefits to eligible families. Assistance includes cash, vouchers, and other forms of aid for basic needs. Certain activities like child care and tax credits are not considered assistance. The work participation standard applies to families receiving assistance. The TANF program provides funding to state-level programs offering various benefits to eligible families, including cash assistance. States design work requirements for recipients to meet work participation standards, determining exemptions, activities, and sanctions for non-compliance. Most states end benefits for families with non-compliant individuals, except for New York and California. The TANF program sets work participation standards for states, with numerical targets and credits for caseload reduction. States must calculate their work participation rate based on specific rules, including defining eligible families and activities that count towards the rate. Failure to meet these standards puts states at risk of sanctions. States that fail to meet their work participation standards are at risk of penalties. They can avoid penalties by claiming reasonable cause or entering a corrective compliance plan. Caseload reduction can help states meet their work participation standard, with credit given for each 1% decline in caseload. States are not penalized if they come into compliance within the corrective compliance plan timeframe. The caseload reduction credit allows states to receive credit for each 1% decline in their caseload from FY2005 to the most recent prior year. States provide HHS with their gross caseload decline and estimate the effects of policy changes on that decline to determine the net caseload reduction credit. This credit is subtracted from the work participation standard, with the minimum WPR required to meet the standard being the remaining percentage after the credit is applied. The caseload reduction credit has historically played a significant role in welfare reform laws. The 1996 welfare reform law initially measured caseload reduction from FY1995. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 changed the base year to FY2005 for measuring caseload declines. Caseloads declined sharply in the late 1990s and continued to fall, with temporary increases during the 2007-2009 recession. Large caseload reductions resulted in significant credits, especially before FY2007. The cumulative caseload decline exceeded 50% in the early 2000s. Caseload reduction credits were determined on a state-by-state basis, netting out the effect of policy changes. In FY2002, the caseload reduction credit was 50 percentage points in 21 states, reducing the minimum work participation rate to 0%. Caseload declines were smaller in FY2007 and beyond due to changes in measuring caseload declines. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 froze caseload reduction credits through FY2011, preventing an increase in the minimum work participation rate. Caseloads began to decrease again after FY2011. States can receive credit for exceeding required spending under the TANF MOE. States can count extra state dollars spent on TANF-eligible families towards caseload reduction credits. The credit for excess state spending became more utilized after a change in the caseload reduction credit calculation in FY2007. A Government Accountability Office analysis found that 16 states would not have met the TANF work participation standard without this credit. States must also meet a higher work participation standard for two-parent families, which can be reduced by their caseload reduction credit. Before FY2007, many states assisted two-parent families. The 1996 welfare reform law established TANF rules that excluded two-parent families in separate state programs from work participation calculations. The DRA changed this, leading states to aid two-parent families in solely state-funded programs to avoid including them in work participation standards. In FY2015, 22 states had no two-parent families receiving TANF or MOE-funded assistance. Some states also use solely state-funded programs to aid other recipients, excluding them from work participation calculations. The TANF Work Participation Rate (WPR) calculation includes families with work-eligible individuals receiving assistance. Work-eligible individuals are adults or single minor parents receiving assistance for themselves and their children. Child-only families, where relatives care for children but do not receive benefits for themselves, are excluded from the WPR calculation. In FY2015, 62% of families receiving TANF assistance had a work-eligible individual, with 57% included in the WPR calculation after disregards. Individuals must participate in defined work activities for a minimum number of hours per week to be counted in the WPR. To be considered engaged for the two-parent standard under TANF, parents must participate for a combined 50 hours per week, rising to 55 hours with federally funded child care. Federal law lists 12 activities that count toward the work participation rate, including employment, job training, education, and community service. Pre-employment activities are limited in counting towards the TANF work participation rate. Under TANF, job search and readiness count for up to 12 weeks in a 12-month period, while vocational educational training counts for up to 12 months in a recipient's lifetime. Other education and training are also counted under limited circumstances. Teen parents without a high school diploma may be counted toward the work participation rate if they are completing secondary school or in a GED program. Adult recipients may only have education and training count in limited circumstances. States experimented with different earnings disregards under waivers of federal AFDC rules before the 1996 welfare law. Under TANF, there are no federal rules prescribing earnings disregard. Under TANF, states have various earnings disregards allowing families to stay on welfare longer with higher earnings. This has led to more TANF families having employed individuals, helping states meet work participation standards. Earnings supplement programs provide additional benefits to working parents separate from regular TANF cash assistance. Some programs target welfare leavers who remain employed, offering small monthly benefits. Under TANF, states have earnings disregards allowing families to stay on welfare longer with higher earnings, leading to more employed TANF families. Earnings supplement programs provide additional benefits to working parents, such as California's $10 work incentive nutrition benefit. These programs help meet work participation standards by supporting working parents outside of regular state assistance programs. The national TANF Work Participation Rates (WPRs) for FY2002 through FY2015 have been below 50%, with a significant increase from 36% in FY2014 to an estimated 48% in FY2015. Participation is divided into categories like unsubsidized employment in \"earnings supplement\" programs, regular TANF assistance programs, and welfare-to-work activities. The national TANF Work Participation Rates (WPRs) have been below 50% from FY2002 to FY2015, with a notable increase to 48% in FY2015. Participation mainly consists of unsubsidized employment, particularly in employment subsidy programs like California's earnings supplement program. In FY2015, participation solely in unsubsidized employment accounted for 64% of all work participation creditable toward the TANF WPR. The participation in welfare-to-work activities among non-employed TANF work-eligible individuals has been relatively low, with less than 1 in 4 recipients reported as participating in such activities. The rate of engagement has decreased since FY2011, with only about 1 in 5 non-employed individuals participating in activities in FY2015. Participation in welfare-to-work activities among non-employed TANF work-eligible individuals has been low, with less than 1 in 5 individuals participating in FY2015. Pre-employment activities were more common than supportive work activities, with job search and readiness being the most common activity. There has been a decline in cash assistance caseloads over the past 20 years since TANF was enacted. The decline in cash assistance caseloads over the past 20 years, with an increase in working families receiving assistance, raises questions about future policy directions in TANF. The TANF work participation standard incentivizes states to continue pursuing these goals, with a focus on reducing welfare dependency. The caseload reduction credit aims to impact state TANF programs by shifting focus from measuring participation rates to outcomes. The late 1990s saw a decline in caseloads, which was seen as a sign of reduced welfare dependency. Since the late 1990s, there has been a decline in cash assistance caseloads, with more working families receiving assistance. This trend raises questions about the future direction of TANF policies. The caseload decline was initially seen as a positive indicator of reduced welfare dependency, but since 2000, child poverty has increased, single mothers' employment gains have eroded, and the number of eligible families not receiving benefits has risen. This has led to concerns that TANF is not effectively meeting the needs of poor families. The George W. Bush Administration proposed eliminating the caseload reduction credit under TANF and replacing it with a credit for employed leavers. The Senate Finance Committee supported legislation to swap an employment credit for the caseload reduction credit, while House-passed TANF reauthorization bills aimed to retain the caseload reduction credit. The excess spending credit was intended to incentivize states to invest in TANF-related activities, but questions have been raised about its effectiveness due to the wide range of activities that can count towards the state's spending requirement. The excess spending credit in TANF has raised questions about its effectiveness, with concerns about whether increased spending represents higher service levels. Congress could consider eliminating this credit and focusing on true caseload reduction instead. States have had success in moving recipients from welfare to work by expanding assistance to working families, as seen in pre-1996 welfare reform experiments. Research on earnings supplement programs for working families is outdated, with no studies on their effectiveness. Policymakers are interested in increasing engagement in welfare-to-work programs. Congress required data collection on TANF recipients with zero hours of engagement. The 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) study focused on promoting wider use of employment-focused approaches for TANF assistance recipients with zero hours of engagement. Questions arise about reasonable engagement rates, activities for non-employed recipients, and changes in program structure to increase engagement. Limited current research addresses these questions, with most relevant studies predating the 1996 welfare reform. The research on welfare reform experiments is outdated and may not be applicable to current policies. States have struggled to engage a significant portion of non-employed work-eligible individuals in welfare-to-work activities. MDRC warned in 1995 that the participation rates expected in the 1996 welfare reform law were higher than any achieved in previous demonstrations. There is a lack of current research to guide policymakers on welfare-to-work program engagement rates. Proposals have been made to expand the types of activities that can count towards work participation standards, such as pursuing a GED or vocational education training. Critics reference outdated research that suggests education and training programs may not lead to better outcomes for recipients. Recent interest in subsidized employment programs has emerged, stemming from outdated research indicating that education and training programs may not lead to better outcomes for welfare recipients. The effectiveness of past programs has been questioned, with a shift towards \"career pathways\" programs that combine work and training. There is a need to reevaluate the engagement of TANF work-eligible individuals in supported work activities to determine their long-term employment impacts. Recent interest in subsidized employment programs has been fueled by past TANF-funded initiatives and research on transitional jobs programs. These programs targeted low-income parents and youths, raising incomes but showing limited long-term employment impacts. Currently, evaluations of subsidized employment pilot projects are being conducted by HHS and DOL, sparking policy debates on welfare-to-work issues. The discussion revolves around the work participation standard in welfare programs, questioning if current methods detract from engaging non-employed recipients in work activities. Suggestions include modifying the standard to exclude caseload reduction and unsubsidized employment as credits, and considering an outcome-based measure focusing on employment and earnings. Concerns include potential bias towards successful cases. The impact of such changes on engagement in welfare-to-work activities remains uncertain. The 2014 GAO report highlighted the lack of incentives for state and local TANF agencies to adopt promising approaches for moving recipients into employment. Funding limitations have led states to focus on helping those who can easily get a job, potentially neglecting hard-to-employ TANF clients who require more resources and support. States receive a set amount of TANF funding per year, limiting resources available for welfare-to-work activities. The TANF program provides a set amount of funding per year to states, limiting resources for welfare-to-work activities. States can meet work participation standards through various means and still receive the same federal funding. However, relying on performance measures to enforce national policy objectives poses risks of unintended behaviors. The TANF program provides funding to states for welfare-to-work activities, but using performance measures to enforce national policy objectives may lead to dysfunctional responses. Congress could consider creating a separate program with dedicated funding to provide employment services for non-employed recipients. The Welfare-to-Work grant program, funded by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, added dedicated funding for work activities for hard-to-serve TANF recipients. The ECF, added to TANF by ARRA, provided funding for basic assistance, short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. The TANF work participation standard measures state engagement in work activities and reinforces the policy goal of work for welfare assistance recipients. The TANF work participation standard sets a minimum requirement for states to meet, with specific percentages of families engaged in work activities for a minimum number of hours. States can receive credits for caseload reduction and exceeding spending requirements. States may receive credits for exceeding spending requirements under the TANF program. This excess spending can be considered as caseload reduction, leading to extra credits. The work participation rate is calculated by dividing the number of families engaged in work by the total number of families included in the calculation. Not all families receiving cash assistance are included in this rate. Families included in the TANF work participation rate are those receiving assistance from federal TANF or state MOE funds. Certain families are excluded, such as those without a work-eligible individual, single parents caring for a child under one year old, those participating in tribal programs, or under sanction for non-compliance with work requirements. The calculation subtracts families without work-eligible individuals and those disregarded from the rate. The TANF work participation rate includes families receiving assistance, excluding those without work-eligible individuals or under certain exemptions. Work-eligible individuals must engage in specific activities for a minimum number of hours per week to meet the standard. Federal law lists 12 categories of creditable activities, with HHS regulations defining each category. The TANF work participation rate includes families receiving assistance, with work-eligible individuals engaging in specific activities for a minimum number of hours per week. The 12 categories of creditable activities are comprehensive, including education and rehabilitative activities. To meet the standard, family members must meet minimum hours per week based on family composition and age of the youngest child. For a child under six, 20 hours per week are needed for a state to consider them participants. Two-parent families require more hours, with combined hours of both parents considered. Table A-3 outlines core and supplemental activities for meeting the work participation standard. Only actual participation hours count, with an excused absence policy in place. States receive credit for all hours in paid activities. The excused absence policy allows for credited hours in paid activities, including holidays and paid leave. Unpaid activities have a limit of 10 holidays and 80 hours of excused absences per year, with daily supervision required. Teen parents without a high school diploma can be deemed engaged in work through education related to employment or progress towards completing a secondary school program. Teen parents without a high school diploma can be considered engaged in work through education related to employment or progress towards completing a secondary school program. States are required to report data on TANF participation in work activities based on the TANF national data files, which include demographic and economic information at the family and individual recipient levels. States are required to report information on TANF work participation rates, including average weekly hours of engagement in countable activities. The TANF national data files may not include information on \"other\" work activities, leading to potential sampling and nonsampling errors. State-to-state variation in reporting practices could also impact data quality. States are required to report work participation data for TANF, including hours spent in creditable activities. Job search is limited to 12 weeks per year. Non-reporting of activities was minimal in FY2011. HHS uses state-reported data to assess compliance, but may use a different version for public release. Earnings supplement programs are identified in TANF data files. The TANF national data files do not separately identify families receiving assistance from \"earnings supplement\" programs. Criteria used to identify families in such programs include receiving assistance in a separate state program counted toward the TANF MOE, with high employment rates and low benefits. Earnings supplement programs could only be identified for FY2007 and later years. States often used separate state programs to assist two-parent families before FY2007."
