    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the US migrate to Latin America and the Caribbean, providing environmental and economic benefits. Many of these migratory bird populations are declining due to habitat loss and pollution. Conservation efforts require cooperation among countries along their migration routes. Conservation efforts for birds and their habitat can be strengthened through increased coordination. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States and Latin America, and foster international cooperation for these initiatives. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n        (1) Account.--The term ``Account'' means the Neotropical \n    Migratory Bird Conservation Account established by section 9(a).\n        (2) Conservation.--The term ``conservation'' means methods necessary to ensure the long-term viability of neotropical migratory bird species, including protection, habitat management, research, law enforcement, and community outreach.\n        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n    the Interior. The Secretary will establish a program to provide financial assistance for projects promoting the conservation of neotropical migratory birds. Project proposals can be submitted by various entities, including individuals, government agencies, and international organizations. Proposals must include the project leader's name and a brief statement of the project's purpose. The project proposal must include a succinct statement of purposes, qualifications of individuals, estimated funds and time, conservation enhancement for neotropical migratory bird species, local public participation mechanisms, consultation with relevant authorities, sensitivity to local resources, promotion of sustainable programs, and any other information deemed necessary by the Secretary. The project proposal must include relevant information for evaluating the proposal, periodic project reporting to the Secretary, and cost-sharing details with a maximum Federal share of 25 percent and non-Federal share requirements. Non-Federal share for projects in the United States must be paid in cash, while projects in foreign countries may be paid in cash or in kind. The Secretary's duties under the Act include developing guidelines for project proposals, encouraging submissions from wildlife management authorities, selecting proposals that meet requirements and conservation needs, and implementing the Act. Cooperation is also emphasized. The Secretary is tasked with supporting and coordinating efforts to conserve neotropical migratory bird species by facilitating meetings, exchanging information, entering agreements, and coordinating activities with existing efforts. An advisory group may be convened to assist in these efforts, consisting of individuals from public and private organizations involved in bird conservation. The advisory group for neotropical migratory bird conservation must hold open meetings, provide opportunities for public input, give timely notice of meetings, keep and share meeting minutes, and is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by October 1, 2002, on the program's results and effectiveness under this Act, with recommendations for improvement and whether the program should continue. Additionally, there is a Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account established. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account is established in the Multinational Species Conservation Fund of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury will deposit donations and appropriated amounts into the Account. The Secretary can use the funds for the Act's implementation, with a limit of 3% or $80,000 for administrative expenses. Donations can be accepted and used for the Act's purposes. Donations will be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit into the Account. Authorization of appropriations for the Account to carry out the Act is set at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005, with a requirement that at least 75 percent of the funds be used for projects outside the United States."
