    "content": "The Act titled the \"Riayan Tejeda Memorial Act of 2003\" establishes requirements for naturalization through service in combat zones during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The \"Riayan Tejeda Memorial Act of 2003\" allows certain aliens who served honorably in the military during Operation Iraqi Freedom to be naturalized without following the usual requirements. No fees can be charged for this naturalization process. No fees can be charged for filing an application for naturalization or for the issuance of a certificate of naturalization. Naturalization proceedings overseas for members of the Armed Forces must be available through U.S. embassies, consulates, and military installations. SEC. 3. Extension of posthumous benefits to surviving spouses, children, and parents. Extension of posthumous benefits to surviving spouses, children, and parents includes provisions for spouses of deceased citizens who served in the military to be considered immediate relatives for immigration purposes under certain conditions. The extension of posthumous benefits to surviving spouses and children of deceased citizens who served in the military includes provisions for the alien spouse to be considered an alien spouse under certain conditions until remarriage, and for the alien child to remain an immediate relative after the citizen's death. The alien spouse of a deceased citizen who served in the military can file a petition within 2 years of the citizen's death to be classified under immigration laws. Additionally, the parent of a deceased citizen who served in the military can be eligible for benefits if the citizen served honorably in the military. An alien in the Coast Guard Reserve who dies in a combat zone related to Operation Iraqi Freedom can remain an immediate relative under immigration law if a petition is filed within 2 years of the citizen's death. Under section 204(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a citizen described in subparagraph (A) does not have to be 21 years old for a parent to benefit. Applications for adjustment of status by surviving spouses, children, and parents can be adjudicated as if the death had not occurred if the alien applied before the death. An alien described in this context served honorably for any period of time. Under section 204(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a citizen described in subparagraph (A) does not have to be 21 years old for a parent to benefit. Applications for adjustment of status by surviving spouses, children, and parents can be adjudicated as if the death had not occurred if the alien applied before the death. An alien described in this context served honorably for any period of time in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard in a combat zone designated in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom, and died as a result of injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by that service, and was granted posthumous citizenship under section 329A of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Spouses and children of lawful permanent resident aliens can be considered immediate relatives under certain conditions. Under section 204(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a citizen can petition for immediate relative status for their spouse or child. The spouse or child can apply for deferred action, advance parole, and work authorization. They can also file a petition with the Secretary of Homeland Security for classification under the Act. Additionally, spouses or children of aliens who are not beneficiaries of a family-sponsored immigrant petition can self-petition. A petition for classification as a family-sponsored immigrant can be filed under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The spouse or child must file within 2 years to be eligible for deferred action, advance parole, and work authorization. An alien described in this context is one who served honorably in the military in a combat zone designated in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom, died as a result of service-related injury or disease, and was granted posthumous citizenship. Parents of Lawful Permanent Resident Aliens who meet certain criteria, such as serving in the military in a combat zone designated in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom and dying as a result of service-related injury or disease, may file a petition for classification under the Immigration and Nationality Act within 2 years. This petition allows for deferred action, advance parole, and work authorization. Alien beneficiaries of petitions under specific subsections may apply for adjustment of status to permanent residence. Grounds for inadmissibility specified in certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act do not apply to aliens accorded benefits under this section. Prohibition on benefits to survivors under a specific section of the Act is not applicable. Section 329A(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act does not apply to benefits granted to relatives of individuals posthumously granted citizenship for their service in specified military branches in combat zones related to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Surviving spouses, children, or parents of a deceased U.S. citizen who died during honorable service in designated combat zones can be naturalized without the usual residency requirements under title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Priority for naturalization applications is given to applications filed under section 2 of the Act and applications for naturalization of family members of individuals who have served in specified military branches in combat zones related to Operation Iraqi Freedom."
