    "content": "The Valles Caldera National Preserve Management Act establishes definitions for terms like \"eligible employee,\" \"Fund,\" \"Preserve,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"Trust.\" It also designates the Valles Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico. The Valles Caldera National Preserve is designated as a unit of the National Park System to protect various values. The Secretary will manage the Preserve according to applicable laws and may coordinate with Bandelier National Monument. A management plan must be developed within three fiscal years of funds availability. After funds are available, the Secretary will prepare a management plan for the Valles Caldera National Preserve in consultation with various entities. The plan must comply with relevant laws and may involve land acquisition within the Preserve's boundaries. The Valles Caldera National Preserve can acquire land through purchase, donation, or transfer from another Federal agency. Acquired land will be administered as part of the Preserve. The Secretary will carry out a science and education program until a management plan is completed, then establish a new program allowing research and interpretation of natural, historic, and cultural aspects. The Valles Caldera National Preserve aims to preserve natural, historic, cultural, and scientific features, promote ecological restoration and outdoor education, and may establish a science and education center. The Secretary may allow grazing of livestock for scientific research or interpretation of ranching history within the Preserve. The Act does not affect the State's responsibilities for fish and wildlife. The Department of Game and Fish permits hunting and fishing in the Preserve according to laws and may designate no-hunting zones for safety and wildlife protection. The Secretary undertakes ecological restoration activities in forest, grassland, and riparian areas. Land within the Preserve is withdrawn from certain uses, subject to existing rights. Interests in land within the boundaries of the Preserve are withdrawn from entry, disposal, or appropriation under public land laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. No construction of roads or buildings, and no motorized access allowed in the area above 9,600 feet in elevation or 250 feet below the top of specified volcanic domes and peaks.

Agreements will be sought with affected Indian tribes or pueblos to protect cultural and religious sites and privacy. Valid existing rights are not affected by this Act. TRANSFER OF ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION. The Preserve's administrative jurisdiction is transferred to the Secretary for management as part of the National Park System. The Santa Fe National Forest boundaries are adjusted to exclude the Preserve. An interim management agreement will be established between the Secretary and the Trust for a smooth transition of administration. Until a new management plan is completed, the Secretary can follow existing Trust management activities that align with specified guidelines. The Valles Caldera Trust will terminate unless the Secretary extends it for transitional management. Upon termination, all Trust assets will transfer to the Secretary, and any appropriated funds will be available for Preserve administration. The Secretary will assume all contracts and liabilities upon Trust termination. The Trust will prepare a budget for interim Preserve management within 90 days of the Act's enactment. New liabilities must have written approval from the Secretary. The Secretary and Secretary of Agriculture can hire Trust employees for similar positions at the Preserve or other areas.

Effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall assume the powers of the Trust over the Valles caldera fund for the management of the Preserve. Any amounts in the Fund as of the date of enactment shall be available to the Secretary without further appropriation. SEC. 5. REPEAL OF VALLES CALDERA PRESERVATION ACT.
