The President requested $324.2 million for the program in FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $526.0 million and $492.5 million respectively for FY2008, including $310 million for state grants. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the SDFSC program in FY2006. The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program (SDFSC) with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. SDFSCA is the federal government's initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools, awarding state grants and funding national programs. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program (SDFSC) receives funding for national leadership projects to prevent drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants, with specific allocations for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Indian youth programs, and native Hawaiians. Remaining funds are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program (SDFSC) receives funding for national leadership projects to prevent drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. State grant funds may be redistributed if not used within two years. A limitation on increasing national program funds is in place unless state grant funding increases by at least 10%. For FY2007, the Administration did not suggest funding for state grants. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts. An SEA must distribute at least 93% of its allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs must allocate 93% of their funds for drug and violence prevention programs, with 60% based on ESEA Title I, Part A funding and 40% on school enrollments. SEAs can use up to 3% for program administration, and an additional 1% for a management information system. The system collects data on truancy, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and drug use among minors. The Administration found the state grants component of the SDFSC program to be \"ineffective\" due to the inability to demonstrate program effectiveness and the distribution of funds being too thin to support quality interventions. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was deemed insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The state grants program under the SDFSC was deemed ineffective and was proposed to be terminated due to lack of measurable outcomes and fiscal constraints. The Administration believed that national programs would be more effective in achieving results and expanding knowledge on drug and violence prevention methods. The national programs were seen as providing direct support to LEAs with sufficient funding to make a difference, allowing for progress assessment and effectiveness measurement. The state grants program under the SDFSC was ineffective and proposed to be terminated. National programs using CDC data will determine the extent of teen drug use and violence. Evaluation methods will measure the impact of interventions and improve data collection for SDFSC programs. National program funds allow collaboration with health and law enforcement agencies to prevent violence and drug use among students. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was created to recruit, hire, and train SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. Middle school students were targeted for drug prevention and school safety programs. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004. National program funds may be distributed as formula grants to states based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Grants may be awarded to LEAs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for hate crime affected areas, a School Security Technology and Resource Center, and resources for school security assessment and technology development. The government is focusing on school security by developing technology, providing technical assistance, and establishing a National Center for School and Youth Safety. Funding requests for the program have increased, with the President requesting $324.2 million for FY2008 and the House Appropriations Committee recommending $526.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, including $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. The President requested $216.0 million for national programs in FY2007, $6.3 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. For FY2008, the President did not request funding for the mentoring program. In FY2007, the President requested $19 million for the mentoring program, the final year of a two-year phase-out. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $19 million. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, with a slight reduction to $48.8 million due to a budget cut. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program from FY2005 to FY2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for FY2005 and FY2006. Funding was slightly reduced to $32.4 million in FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR in FY2007, but the Senate recommended $32.4 million, the same as FY2006. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million for the SDFSC program, operating at FY2006 levels. The Gun-Free Schools Act is part of SDFSCA, requiring LEAs to expel students bringing weapons to school, with some flexibility for chief administering officers. States must ensure compliance with expulsion requirements and report details of expulsions to receive GFSA funds. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires LEAs to report the number of students expelled for bringing firearms to school. LEAs must have a policy for reporting such incidents to law enforcement to receive GFSA funds. Certain exceptions apply, such as lawfully stored firearms in locked vehicles or for approved activities. Bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced in the 109th Congress, with one bill (H.R. 3010) requiring a study on the effectiveness of violence prevention programs under SDFSCA. Several bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced in the 109th Congress, including H.R. 283, H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028. These bills aimed to amend the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) to include bullying, gang prevention, drug, and violence prevention programs. However, amendments to increase funding for the SDFSC program were ruled out of order. Several bills were introduced in the 109th Congress to enhance school safety and violence prevention. H.R. 284 aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. H.R. 3655 directed the Education Secretary to improve state and local prevention programs. H.R. 5295, the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, focused on school safety measures. H.R. 5295, the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, required LEAs to have policies allowing teachers to search students for weapons or drugs on school property. Non-compliance would result in denial of SDFSCA funds. Another bill, the Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005, aimed to test high school students for performance-enhancing drug use through statewide pilot programs. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 introduced by Senator Menendez aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization levels, and allocate funds for national programs. It required LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention coordinators, and reserved funds for mentoring programs targeting students in high-need areas. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to combat gang activity in troubled schools by allowing students to transfer to safer schools within the same district. Priority is given to programs targeting teens in high-crime communities. The bill also includes an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of $50 million for nonprofit groups to create innovative programs to address gang activity. The bill H.R. 354 aims to allow students who become victims of violent crimes in or around school premises, including while riding a school bus or attending a school function, to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools. It differs from current law by not requiring the school to be labeled as \"persistently dangerous\" and provides the option of counseling or removal of the offender. The bill was referred to the House Education and Labor Committee but no further action has been taken. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe school environments. They propose consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program with priorities including managing emergencies, violence prevention, school culture, and improving the learning environment. Congress may also consider requiring schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may be better suited to handle school safety and crime data collection instead of the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. Restructuring state grant programs under DOJ for school safety and security while keeping drug/alcohol prevention and suicide prevention programs at ED in collaboration with HHS could be considered. One potential option for enhancing school security is to allow K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding. This could help protect against potential terrorist attacks on schools and school buses. However, there are concerns about the unintended consequences of the Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, which allows students to transfer from persistently dangerous schools. There may be challenges in defining what constitutes a persistently dangerous school, leading to potential underreporting of school crime and violence. Legal issues could also arise due to varying definitions of school safety across states. Officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting their ability to receive funding for school violence prevention grants. The lack of funding for schools identified as persistently dangerous hinders their ability to improve school safety programs, while federal and state budgets cut school safety funds."
