    "content": "The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, shared goals, and overlapping interests. Both sides face similar challenges such as economic concerns, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and armed conflicts. Supporters argue that close cooperation is necessary as neither side can address global issues alone. The relationship also includes a significant trade and investment partnership. Members of Congress frequently engage with European legislators and officials on economic, security, and diplomatic issues. They assess the dynamics of U.S.-European cooperation in terms of benefits, alignment, and partnership. Many support a close transatlantic relationship, viewing the EU, NATO, and a united Europe as advancing U.S. interests. Congressional interest in Europe stems from the need for like-minded partners in facing global challenges, although concerns arise when policy positions conflict or cooperation is questioned. The institutional pillars of the Euro-Atlantic community, NATO and the EU, have been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The relationship between the United States and the EU is growing in significance, with the EU becoming an important partner for the U.S. in various areas. NATO continues to play a crucial role in transatlantic relations. The EU and NATO are key institutions in the Euro-Atlantic community. NATO, with the US playing a leading role, remains crucial for security. NATO has expanded with 12 new member states and is discussing its future role. Recent conflicts in Ukraine and tensions with Russia have influenced these discussions. In 2014, there were leadership transitions in Euro-Atlantic institutions, with new MEPs elected and Jens Stoltenberg becoming the new Secretary General of NATO. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Jens Stoltenberg replaced Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General, Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as EU's High Representative, and Donald Tusk became President of the European Council. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under Obama were relatively favorable compared to the Bush Administration. Transatlantic relations have been mostly constructive, with common approaches to global challenges, despite some frustrations. After the 2012 announcement of a \"re-balancing\" of U.S. foreign policy towards Asia, Europeans expressed anxiety about U.S. pulling back from Europe. The crisis in Ukraine led to a reevaluation of European security, with the U.S. continuing to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. U.S. hopes for Europe include sharing the burden of security, taking a leading role in regional and international issues, and being an effective partner in addressing common threats. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties in the long-term partnership. Europe's economic difficulties, declining defense spending, and questions about its common foreign policy concern U.S. officials. The European financial crisis highlighted tensions among EU member states, with unresolved issues and uncertainty about further integration. Anti-establishment backlash and the rise of new political parties reflect dissatisfaction with traditional mainstream parties in Europe. The rise of populist parties advocating far-right and far-left policies in Europe has led to anti-EU sentiments, with Euro-skeptic parties winning a significant portion of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election. The trend is further tested with national elections in various countries, including the UK, where a possible referendum on EU membership could have major implications. Domestic challenges such as political instability, economic struggles, and growing skepticism about the EU are affecting European politics. The deterioration of U.S. and European relations with Russia in 2014 transformed Russia from a \"strategic partner\" to a \"strategic problem.\" Tensions between Russia and the West have been ongoing, with points of conflict such as NATO enlargement and the 2008 conflict with Georgia. Despite efforts to improve relations, recent Russian actions have hindered cooperation. Cooperation between the U.S. and Russia improved with the signing of the New START treaty, but tensions remained over Russia's policies on various issues. Strains increased as criticism of Russia's elections triggered backlash, leading to further disagreements on foreign policy, including Russia's support for Assad in Syria and opposition to NATO operations in Libya. In late 2013, a political crisis in Ukraine led to U.S. and European tensions with Russia. Russia pressured Ukraine to reject an EU agreement, leading to protests and a new pro-Western government. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, citing historical ties. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was seen as rectifying a transfer from Russia to Ukraine, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population, many of whom identify as Russian. The annexation and referendum are not recognized internationally, leading to sanctions. The conflict in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 has resulted in over 4,300 deaths, with evidence of Russian military involvement. The U.S. and Europe have coordinated responses to Russia's involvement in Ukraine, with aligned analyses and extensive sanctions. The EU expanded sanctions after the MH17 plane crash, targeting wider sectors of the Russian economy. Unlike the U.S., many European countries have significant economic ties with Russia. The EU debates over sanctions on Russia, considering economic value, political influence, and doubts about effectiveness. Despite skepticism, all 28 EU member states unanimously adopted sanctions as a political imperative. Sanctions are reviewed monthly, with unanimity needed for renewal. Russia's economy is in recession with a weakened ruble and high inflation. Russia's economy is in recession with a weakened ruble and high inflation, mainly due to a sharp drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. Speculation surrounds Russia's next steps in eastern Ukraine, ranging from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking a de-escalation of tensions. In January 2015, the EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with the ceasefire agreement, but combat in eastern Ukraine led to doubts about this idea. The High Representative emphasized that any proposal regarding Russia depends on its full implementation of the ceasefire agreement. U.S. and European relations with Russia are expected to remain a central topic as policy makers analyze Russia's foreign policy intentions. Members of Congress may consider adopting additional sanctions or deterrents and cooperating with European counterparts. They may also explore ways to support Ukraine, building on previous aid provided in 2014. The US and EU have provided financial support to Ukraine, with the US offering $139 million in bilateral assistance and the EU planning to provide over $12.3 billion in development assistance. The US Congress passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act authorizing $350 million in military aid, including lethal weapons, but the Administration has not committed to providing such aid. International financial assistance is tied to Ukraine's economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts, while Russia's actions in Ukraine have impacted NATO and US-European defense discussions. The Obama Administration has taken steps to reassure European allies of the U.S. commitment to European security through the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), which includes troop rotations and pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe in response to Russian aggression. Congress appropriated $810 million for the initiative in December 2014. The United States has no plans to permanently increase military personnel in Europe, despite closing 15 bases in 2015. Concerns about NATO's future revolve around declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military capabilities gap. European militaries lack important capabilities, leading to calls for defense integration initiatives like NATO's \"Smart Defense\" initiative. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO members have debated the alliance's focus between collective defense and out-of-area operations. The 2010 Strategic Concept emphasizes NATO's role in collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security, while also urging member states to develop capabilities for expeditionary operations and unconventional security challenges. In the aftermath of Afghanistan, analysts believe Europe may be less willing to engage in large-scale missions overseas due to public opposition, political will, and resource shortages. European countries are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by Russia, with some calling for permanent U.S. and NATO forces on their territory. The European Reassurance Initiative includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security. NATO countries have tripled fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission, and at the 2014 Summit, they agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for increased readiness. The \"Readiness Action Plan\" outlined by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the Cold War. It includes measures in Central and Eastern Europe like enhanced infrastructure, pre-positioning of equipment, and the establishment of bases for troop deployments. Allies also agreed to create a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats. Additionally, leaders pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. Europe's energy security concerns have been heightened due to tensions with Russia. Europe's energy security concerns have become a major issue due to its dependence on Russian gas and oil supplies. Russia has been using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, acquiring ownership of European energy infrastructure without adhering to Western standards. The possibility of gas cutoffs, as seen in past disputes with Ukraine, has raised concerns. Many U.S. officials view European energy security as a U.S. interest. Europe's energy security is a concern for the United States due to Russian dominance in the region. The US has encouraged EU states to reduce energy dependence on Russia through diversification of supply. However, challenges such as political instability in North Africa and Russian interference in pipeline development hinder these efforts. Renewable energy development is also emphasized, but its contribution remains uncertain. European leaders have been working on a common energy strategy to coordinate member states' policies, including initiatives to liberalize the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have increased the urgency for these efforts. Some countries have built LNG terminals, expanded pipeline connections, and developed mechanisms to mitigate gas supply disruptions. The idea of an EU \"energy union\" with a single agency purchasing gas for all members has been proposed, along with solidarity mechanisms for supply disruptions. Before recent events in Ukraine, the EU had adopted legislation to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector by unbundling gas production from distribution. Russia canceled the South Stream project, citing EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of its actions in Ukraine. Russia aims to diversify its gas markets by partnering with China and Turkey. The United States and Europe are working together to combat the Islamic State (IS) terrorist organization in Iraq and Syria. The US leads a coalition to degrade and destroy IS through military action, while European countries participate in airstrikes, provide support to Iraqi forces, and offer humanitarian aid. European military action against IS is limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. Concerns remain about the civil war in Syria, which has resulted in over 191,000 deaths since 2011. The EU, alongside the United States, condemns the Assad government in Syria and imposes sanctions. They support the Syrian National Coalition and provide non-lethal aid to opposition forces. Concerns about terrorism in Europe were heightened after the 2015 Paris attacks and raids on Islamic State-linked cells in Belgium. Authorities are concerned about the threat posed by European citizens joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, with estimates of 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from countries like Austria, Belgium, France, and the UK. There are worries that these fighters may return with extremist views and skills to carry out attacks in Europe. European governments are addressing security concerns by increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, and prohibiting travel. Measures include arresting individuals suspected of planning to travel to Syria, confiscating passports, detaining returning fighters, and setting up websites and hotlines for concerned family members. However, challenges remain in stemming the flow of European fighters to Syria and Iraq, as well as tracking their movements. An EU-wide approach is hindered by differing views on issues such as intelligence-sharing, data privacy, and civil liberties. The July 2005 bombings in London led to EU efforts to strengthen internal counterterrorism capabilities. The Paris attacks have sparked debates on enhancing security and surveillance powers, including the proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11, with regular dialogues and agreements between the US and EU on extradition, legal assistance, container security, and airline passenger data sharing. Additionally, efforts are made to track and counter terrorism financing. The EU and US actively cooperate on counterterrorism efforts, including tracking and countering terrorism financing. While bilateral intelligence sharing is crucial, there are concerns in the EU regarding data privacy safeguards in information-sharing agreements. This has led to complications and delays in adopting agreements such as the SWIFT deal and sharing airline passenger data. The United States and the EU have been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement since 2011. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, a move welcomed by U.S. officials. Critics argue that listing only Hezbollah's military wing is insufficient. In December 2014, the EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's terrorist list due to procedural reasons. The EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's terrorist list due to procedural reasons, but the ruling was not a political decision by EU governments. The United States and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions against Hamas, while Europe has played a central role in international efforts regarding Iran's nuclear program. The EU has shown a willingness to adopt sanctions on Iran independently, signaling a close cooperation with the US. The EU aligned with the US on sanctions against Iran, implementing an oil embargo and imposing restrictions on various sectors. These sanctions, along with those from the US and other international partners, isolated Iran, applying economic pressure and influencing Iran's stance on negotiations. Following the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president in June 2013, tensions eased, leading to the P5+1 and Iran agreeing to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013. The JPA requires Iran to freeze some nuclear activities and cooperate with monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief, including allowing Iran to repatriate proceeds from oil sales and suspending certain trade restrictions. The JPA has been extended twice as negotiators work towards a final deal. Negotiations for a final deal with Iran continue, with significant differences remaining. Concerns persist about Iran's nuclear capabilities and regional influence. The EU opposes new U.S. sanctions, fearing they could disrupt the talks. The diplomatic quartet, including the U.S. and EU, aims for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace and stability in the region are paramount for European officials. European officials have long emphasized the importance of peace and stability in the region and have urged increased U.S. involvement in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Recent talks have been unsuccessful, and conflicts between Israel and Hamas have hindered progress. European countries, including Sweden, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, have shown support for recognizing a Palestinian state, causing concern for Israel. France and Luxembourg also voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution on Israeli-Palestinian issues, despite opposition from the United States. Israel has concerns about reduced economic cooperation with the EU and potential EU measures such as funding restrictions and product labeling in settlements. Analysts believe these measures do not pose a significant economic threat to Israel, as no European government supports boycotting Israel. High Representative Mogherini stated that there are no plans for sanctions, but rather a focus on motivating parties to restart peace talks. The EU may offer financial incentives and an upgrade in ties to Israel and the Palestinians in case of a successful peace agreement. The US and EU have a significant trade relationship, with merchandise trade totaling $787 billion in 2013. The United States and the EU have a significant economic relationship, with U.S. corporate assets in Europe totaling over $13 trillion. They are negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) to boost jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. This partnership aims to harmonize regulations and standards to increase GDP for both the U.S. and Europe. The TTIP is crucial for the U.S.-EU relationship as it aims to define global standards and strengthen ties. However, there are concerns about potential obstacles and opposition, particularly regarding investor-state dispute settlement provisions. Critics fear these could limit the EU's regulatory power. Many Europeans are concerned about the potential effects of TTIP on issues such as data privacy and food labeling with regard to geographic protections of items like Champagne and Black Forest ham. On the U.S. side, Congress is considering reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to set trade negotiating objectives for reciprocal trade agreements. The Eurozone crisis dominated European politics from 2010 to 2012, raising doubts about the sustainability of the monetary union without fiscal union. The Eurozone crisis from 2010 to 2012 led to unprecedented steps to stabilize the currency area, including fiscal tightening, banking reforms, and sovereign rescue funds. Market confidence has improved since 2013, but doubts remain about the crisis being definitively over due to ongoing low growth and competitiveness issues. The Eurozone continues to face challenges with low growth, high unemployment, and lagging competitiveness. Economic forecasts for 2015 predict modest growth in the EU and Eurozone, with unemployment rates expected to remain high. The potential standoff between the EU and Greece over austerity measures highlights ongoing market unease. The ECB's stimulus program aims to address economic stagnation, but concerns persist about long-term growth in Europe. Despite these challenges, the U.S. economy has shown resilience. Members of Congress may have ongoing concerns about the impact of European economic conditions. In 2013, reports of NSA surveillance programs in the US and Europe strained transatlantic relations. Concerns arose over US spying on EU offices and German Chancellor Merkel's phone. Leaked documents by Edward Snowden raised questions about US surveillance practices and European involvement. This has led to lasting damage to trust between the US and Europe. The NSA surveillance programs in 2013 caused lasting damage to transatlantic trust, affecting U.S.-European ties. European leaders and citizens were dismayed by reports of privacy violations and security compromises. Criticism was strongest in Germany due to historical surveillance legacies. Fallout from the reports could impact U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements. The European Parliament's objections to SWIFT and PNR agreements were intensified, raising concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards. The aftermath of the 2013 NSA surveillance programs caused tension in U.S.-European relations, with the European Parliament calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement. Some analysts believe the surveillance activities may impact economic relations, while others argue that tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat. European leaders' outrage may be more for domestic consumption, as they are aware of their own security services' surveillance operations and collaboration with U.S. intelligence. The threat of terrorism, especially from the Islamic State, is a key concern for officials. The cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence and security services continues despite political trust issues. The melting Arctic ice is increasing human activities in the region, impacting fisheries, tourism, and resource exploration. The United States will chair the Arctic Council in 2015, addressing various regional issues. The Arctic Council addresses regional development, environment, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction in the Arctic region. The Council consists of eight countries with territory in the Arctic Circle. While the Arctic Council does not focus on security, the region is seen as geopolitically significant. Some coastal states are willing to establish a military presence in the Arctic. Russia is expanding its presence in the region to protect its interests. The Arctic Council focuses on regional development, environment, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction in the Arctic region. China and European countries have shown interest in the Arctic. The U.S. appointed Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr. as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic to lead the 2015-2017 U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council with the theme \"One Arctic, With Shared Opportunities.\" The U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council under Admiral Robert J. Papp in Iceland focuses on stewardship of the Arctic Ocean, climate change, and economic issues through the Arctic Economic Council."
