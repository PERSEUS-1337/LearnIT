    "content": "North Korea's development of prohibited weapons and illicit activities has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy. Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities have continued to grow. The U.S. has security, political, and human rights concerns in the region due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are at risk from North Korea's missiles. North Korea's rapid advances in nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. A conflict or government collapse in Pyongyang would have severe global economic implications. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program impact U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea. Dealing with the totalitarian regime's resistance to outside influences is a complex challenge. North Korea's militarization under the Kims has allowed the regime to extract concessions from foreign powers but has also hindered economic growth. Despite signs of economic strengthening, internal conditions remain difficult with widespread poverty. Congress influences U.S. policy on North Korea through sanctions legislation. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation, human rights advocacy, and oversight of nuclear agreements. They authorize funds for aid and hold hearings on various aspects of North Korea, including its capabilities, intentions, and sanctions evasion. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. This acceleration in capability has made North Korea a top-line U.S. foreign policy and national security problem, surpassing the Middle East and terrorism. Pyongyang's threats have increased in various domains, including nuclear weapons, long-range missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattack capacity. North Korea conducted three nuclear tests between January 2016 and September 2017, with the sixth test being the most powerful to date. Additionally, in 2017, North Korea conducted multiple missile tests demonstrating a capability of reaching the continental United States. North Korea is developing its submarine-based ballistic missile program to evade U.S. defenses. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack in 2017. They implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, similar to the Obama Administration's approach. The Administration successfully led the UNSC to pass four new sanctions against North Korea. The Trump Administration has pushed for new sanctions against North Korea, urging countries to cut ties with the DPRK. There have been conflicting statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a preventive military strike. North Korea accepted an invitation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea after months of outreach by South Korean officials. In 2018, North Korea's Kim Jong-un engaged in diplomacy with South Korea and China before meeting with US President Trump in Singapore. Kim's shift towards diplomacy was influenced by factors such as harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, economic sanctions, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's confidence in his nuclear deterrent. In June 2018, President Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and future relations. They issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees, denuclearization, normalization of relations, and recovering POW/MIA remains. The agreement between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore focused on recovering POW/MIA remains and suspending U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Trump also expressed a desire to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The agreement was seen as covering familiar ground from previous agreements with North Korea. Critics of the agreement between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore point out the lack of specifics on denuclearization, verification mechanisms, and dismantling of North Korea's ballistic missile program. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay the process. Maintaining existing sanctions is challenging amidst engagement efforts, with concerns that North Korea may seek to prolong negotiations to ease sanction pressure. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, following its nuclear tests. These sanctions have been expanded over the years to target various aspects of North Korea's weapons programs and interactions. The most recent sanctions resolutions were adopted in response to North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016. The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, with six resolutions adopted, the most recent in December 2017. These sanctions ban financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and interactions with North Korea. North Korea's major export items are now banned in international markets, leading to a decline in exports in 2017. The Obama and Trump Administrations pushed countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. It is unclear if the Trump Administration has continued this approach since its diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang in 2018. The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, including executive orders by Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump. Congress passed the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 and the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act. These sanctions limit trade to humanitarian goods, prohibit financial transactions, and restrict new investments. The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, limiting trade to humanitarian goods, prohibiting financial transactions, and restricting new investments. The President has new authority to prohibit transactions involving North Korea's key sectors, U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with designated entities, and U.S. travel to North Korea is limited. North Korea's demands in negotiations for weapons program cessation have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the U.S. as prerequisites for denuclearization. North Korean behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, driven by internal conditions like food shortages. Pyongyang exploits divisions among negotiating parties and stalls talks during political transitions in Washington. Debates continue over the effectiveness of negotiating with North Korea. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 suggests a willingness to denuclearize in exchange for security guarantees, an end to the Korean War, and sanctions relief. However, analysts doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily, viewing them as essential for regime survival. Pyongyang's demands are seen as tactical moves, with nuclear capability seen as non-negotiable for aid and recognition. North Korea has repeatedly stated its determination to maintain its nuclear weapons program, casting doubt on the idea that the pledge at the Singapore summit has changed its intentions. The country has demanded recognition as a nuclear weapons state, modernized its nuclear deterrent, and declared its nuclear weapons are not negotiable. North Korea has also indicated it will not give up its nuclear stockpile until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The 2011 multinational military intervention in Libya may have inadvertently reinforced the perceived value of nuclear arms for regime security in North Korea. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some of its demands and easing sanctions implementation. Prior to the Trump Administration's efforts, the United States engaged in various nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea. The United States engaged in various nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea from 1994 to 2012, including the bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. North Korea's nuclear programs led to discussions of sanctions and a diplomatic mission from former President Jimmy Carter, eventually resulting in the U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework. The U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework involved the U.S. providing North Korea with light water reactor nuclear power plants and fuel oil in exchange for North Korea freezing its plutonium program. Despite delays, North Korea froze its program and received fuel oil, but did not fully comply with IAEA commitments. Tensions escalated in 2002 when the U.S. accused North Korea of a secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of fuel oil shipments and reactor construction. North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its nuclear activities. In response to opposition to the Agreed Framework's terms, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program. North Korea agreed to a moratorium on testing long-range missiles in 1999 in exchange for lifting U.S. sanctions. Talks continued, but a final agreement was elusive. Under the George W. Bush Administration, negotiations expanded to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia in six-party talks. The Six-Party Talks involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia aimed to address North Korea's nuclear arms issue but ultimately failed. A breakthrough in 2005 led to a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees. However, the process broke down due to verification issues. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea focused on pressuring Pyongyang to return to the talks and commit to denuclearization, while coordinating with allies and applying pressure through sanctions. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea focused on pressuring Pyongyang through arms interdictions, sanctions, and military exercises to demonstrate the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance. They sought a comprehensive package deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing as a precondition for negotiations. Sanctions were imposed on entities involved in weapons sales, money laundering, and other illicit activities supporting North Korea's regime. After North Korean hackers were attributed to a cyber attack by the FBI, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang stalled negotiations, leading to a cycle of action and reaction. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in 2012 committed North Korea to a nuclear moratorium in exchange for aid and cultural exchanges, but the deal was ultimately scuttled. North Korea scuttled a deal with the US in 2012 after launching a long-range rocket and conducting a nuclear test in 2013. China plays a crucial role in pressuring North Korea economically and diplomatically, being its largest trading partner and providing essential aid. Beijing's priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent North Korea's collapse, viewing it as a buffer against South Korea and potential refugee flows. China's role as a buffer between North Korea and South Korea often hinders U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea. Despite some increase in enforcing UNSC sanctions in 2017, Chinese companies still violate sanctions, but Beijing's trade and aid to North Korea remain limited to avoid appearing as an enabler of a rogue regime. This dynamic influences the U.S. and South Korean approach towards North Korea. The strained relations between China and North Korea, exacerbated by Kim Jong-un's actions, have led to a shift in China's stance towards its neighbor. Chinese President Xi Jinping has prioritized meetings with South Korean leaders over Kim Jong-un, reflecting a growing dissatisfaction with North Korea. Chinese public opinion has also turned against North Korea, with many supporting U.S. actions against the regime. China has increasingly supported UNSC sanctions against North Korea, signaling a departure from its previous friendly ties with the country. Kim Jong-un's diplomatic efforts in 2018 improved relations with China, as he sought to reaffirm a close relationship ahead of a meeting with Trump. This shift in relations was seen as a victory for China, with Kim gaining goodwill and leverage. Kim is the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, following his grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il. Despite uncertainties about Pyongyang's regime, Kim's actions have led to a de-escalation of hostilities and a turn to diplomacy. Kim Jong-un's emergence on the global stage in 2018 revealed his consolidation of power in North Korea. He has pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons, achieving a \"limited nuclear deterrent.\" Kim has also improved relations with South Korea, China, and the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Initially seen as a potential political reformer, Kim's actions have focused on maintaining his regime and boosting the economy. Kim Jong-un's ruthless drive to consolidate power and maintain the dynastic dictatorship has been evident since he became supreme leader in late 2011. He has carried out brutal purges of senior officials, including the execution of his uncle by marriage, Jang Song-taek, in 2013. Kim has also allowed Western influences in North Korea, such as clothing styles and Disney characters, and is informal in his public appearances. Kim Jong-un's wife was introduced to the North Korean public, while their children remain hidden. Analysts see Kim's stylistic changes as an attempt to appear young and modern, evoking his grandfather's \"man of the people\" image. North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, has seen economic growth under Kim, with increased domestic production and sanctions evasion helping to weather international sanctions. Since early 2016, North Korea has experienced a decline in exports due to international sanctions. Kim Jong-un has allowed market principles to govern some sectors of business, industry, and agriculture, leading to the legalization of consumer and business-to-business markets. This marketization process has been supported by trade with China, accounting for over 90% of North Korea's trade. Additionally, agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have resulted in larger harvests since 2010. Despite increased stability in food production and stable food prices since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate the extent of Kim's changes as \"reforms\" due to conflicting evidence on marketization tolerance by the government. Many North Koreans face limited access to healthcare and significant food shortages. The regime claims to provide universal healthcare, but there are reports of crackdowns on market activity. Access to healthcare in North Korea is limited, with most hospitals in poor condition. In Pyongyang, only the elite have access to better health facilities. The regime controls where families can live based on loyalty, restricting access to quality medical care. Despite efforts to control information flow, some North Koreans are turning to outside news sources. The government tries to prevent citizens from listening to foreign broadcasts by jamming stations and altering radios. Some North Koreans have illegal or modified radios to access foreign broadcasts. The regime restarted a mobile phone network in 2009, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. Mobile phone use has increased, possibly for better surveillance. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls. The spread of cell phones allows faster dissemination of information. Harvard University suggests spreading outside information in North Korea could bring positive political changes. Increased access to information in North Korea through mobile phones could potentially lead to positive political changes. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador, believes that outside sources of information could weaken the regime's control over its citizens. The regime has long indoctrinated its people to be loyal to the Kim family and view the outside world as inferior. With a large military presence and high defense spending, the regime maintains a strong grip on power. However, the deployment of forces near the demilitarized zone shows the regime's readiness for potential conflict. North Korea has concentrated ground forces and 50% of its air and naval forces near the DMZ border for rapid deployment in a conflict with South Korea. The country is focusing on developing nuclear weapons, long-range ballistic missiles, and cyber warfare capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces. North Korea also possesses chemical and possibly biological weapons. The regime's conventional military capabilities have deteriorated since 1990 due to outdated weapons systems. North Korea's military capabilities have atrophied significantly since 1990, with outdated weapons systems and inadequate training. Despite this, they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Analysts believe that in a war on the Korean Peninsula, the United States and South Korea would ultimately prevail, but at a high cost. North Korea's major combat equipment is old and inferior compared to modern systems. To compensate, they have focused on improving asymmetric capabilities such as UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, and electromagnetic pulse technology. Recent advancements have been made in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, and infantry weapons. North Korea has developed military capabilities in various areas such as long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, and submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles. The country's military suffers from institutional weaknesses due to a highly centralized command and control structure, lack of training for mid-level officers, and general resource scarcity affecting readiness. North Korean forces face equipment and food shortages, impacting combat endurance. US analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development for deterrence and prestige. Talks for denuclearization are ongoing, but skepticism remains about Pyongyang's commitment. North Korea sees its nuclear arsenal as vital for survival and deterring US attacks. North Korea has been developing its nuclear force with an emphasis on smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads. They have conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb in 2017. Despite announcing the end of nuclear tests in 2018, fissile material production continues. The North Korean nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union. North Korea's nuclear program includes a small nuclear reactor at Yongbyon producing plutonium, a reprocessing plant, and an uranium enrichment plant. The program has produced between 30 and 40 kilograms of separated plutonium, enough for several nuclear weapons. Additionally, North Korea has explored a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009 for nuclear power production. In 2010, they displayed early construction of a light-water reactor and a uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. The existence of other clandestine enrichment facilities is likely. Estimates suggest North Korea could have 20 to 100 warheads by 2020, but lack of transparency makes it difficult to confirm. North Korea prioritizes developing ballistic missile technology, conducting numerous test launches since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile tests, followed by 18 in 2017, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea also possesses around 700 short-range ballistic missiles. The U.S. intelligence community believes their nuclear weapons program aims to miniaturize warheads for long-range deployment. North Korea is working on developing a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can be mounted on long-range ballistic missiles, with assessments varying on their progress. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to neighboring nations, while North Korea has displayed mock-ups of potential ICBMs capable of reaching the continental United States. Despite not being flight-tested, North Korea has taken initial steps towards fielding this ICBM system, with recent ICBM tests in July 2017. North Korea has shown progress in its medium-range ballistic missile program, including successful tests of solid fuel MRBMs. They are also focusing on developing capabilities to defeat missile defenses like Patriot and THAAD. Some missile tests in 2016 were launched at higher altitudes and shorter ranges, potentially indicating efforts to improve reentry angles and speeds. North Korea's progress in its missile program includes the ability to launch a salvo attack with multiple missiles, making interception more challenging. They are also developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles to counter land-based missile defenses. Previous attempts to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program have been made. North Korea's missile program has faced restrictions and sanctions due to its activities, including flouting resolutions and conducting test launches. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but recent talks have not focused specifically on missiles. North Korea is reported to have a significant arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin. North Korea is reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. Estimates suggest they have 12 facilities for production and storage, with a capability of up to 4,500 metric tons annually. South Korea estimates their current inventory at 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and is suspected of using VX nerve agent in the assassination of Kim Jong Nam. North Korea is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability, with a longstanding capability and infrastructure. They possess anthrax and smallpox, among other weapons agents. North Korea has also proliferated WMD and missile-related technology to countries like Egypt, Iran, and Syria. They assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor destroyed by Israel in 2007. The U.N. Panel of Experts reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea. The Panel of Experts reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea. North Korea, Iran, and China have cooperated on missile development, with Iran's advisors seen in North Korea before a successful launch in December 2012. China sold heavy transport vehicles to North Korea, which were converted into missile transport-erector-launchers. North Korea engages in illicit activities to earn currency for its weapons programs, including drug trafficking and counterfeit currency production. North Korea engages in illicit activities such as drug trafficking and counterfeit currency production to earn currency for its weapons programs. One agency, Office 39, oversees many of these activities, potentially generating between $500 million and $1 billion per year. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies international smuggling networks. It is unclear who is directing these illicit activities, whether by state authority or local criminal gangs. North Korea also sells cheap Cold War-era weapons to states in the Middle East and North Africa. Authorities seized the Jie Shun outside of the Suez Canal in August 2016, finding over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Egyptian military. North Korea cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles and shipping weapons and equipment. The regime uses front companies based in China to mask illicit dealings and keep earnings in overseas bank accounts, avoiding repatriation to North Korea. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of North Korea, such as the Chinese bank Bank of Dandong. In the past, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for the regime. North Korea's human rights record has also been a focus, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. The State Department's reports highlight the dire situation for most North Koreans. The annual human rights reports and reports from private organizations consistently depict extreme human rights abuses by the North Korean regime, emphasizing the denial of political, civil, and religious liberties. Citizens face severe physical abuse for violating laws, with roughly 100,000 political prisoners held in prison camps. Conditions in these camps are described as extremely harsh, with many not surviving. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry found that close to 400,000 prisoners died in North Korean captivity due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. The number of political prisoners has decreased, likely due to high mortality rates in the camps. The UN has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, establishing the Special Rapporteur on human rights in 2004 and the COI in 2013. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry found that North Korea committed \"crimes against humanity\" and recommended referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. Despite a resolution passed by the U.N. General Assembly, no further action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. In 2017, the U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of human rights violations in North Korea for potential future prosecutions. Increasing awareness of better conditions in the outside world has led tens of thousands of North Koreans to flee to China, where they face abuse, neglect, and lack of protection. Many women and children are victims of human trafficking, with some forced into marriage or prostitution. Some refugees make their way to Southeast Asia to seek passage to South Korea, where they receive citizenship. The number of defectors has decreased in recent years, possibly due to tightened border patrols. The changing profile of North Korean defectors includes a small wave of elite defections in 2016, with those of good songbun facing increased difficulty escaping due to tightened border security. Diplomats, responsible for earning foreign currency, may choose to defect if unable to meet expectations. Elite defectors risk imprisonment or execution if caught, with many fleeing to China where they face repatriation. China has been implicated for aiding in repatriating defectors back to North Korea. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors, in violation of the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, labels them as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them. This policy is based on a repatriation treaty between North Korea and China, signed in 1986 and revised in 1998. The 1986 repatriation treaty between North Korea and China, revised in 1998, labels North Korean defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and allows for their deportation. Beijing fears destabilization from allowing refugees into China and maintains its policy to preserve China-North Korea ties. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 authorized funds to support human rights efforts for defectors. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) authorized funds to support human rights efforts and improve information flow in North Korea. It included provisions for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be linked to human rights improvements, the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, and the facilitation of asylum applications for North Koreans in the U.S. Congress reauthorized the NKHRA in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with emphasis on increasing freedom of information into North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) authorized funds to support human rights efforts and improve information flow in North Korea, including distributing media devices and radio broadcasts. President Trump signed bill H.R. 2061 into law (P.L. 115-198) on July 20, 2018. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program for forced labor conditions. North Korean laborers work abroad under exploitative conditions, with the regime taking a significant portion of their earnings. The North Korean regime profits significantly from its overseas workers, taking a large portion of their earnings. The country has a long history of sending laborers abroad, with around 50,000 to 80,000 North Koreans working in various countries. The Trump Administration has pushed for the expulsion of these laborers, with sanctions in place to prevent North Korean goods from entering the United States. The United States provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with aid for food and energy. However, aid was halted in early 2009 due to North Korea's actions, including missile tests and nuclear activities. Congress rejected requests for additional funds for assistance, and U.S. food aid ended in 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. North Korea sought international support for food aid, including the abrogated Leap Day Agreement for 240,000 metric tons of food. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are unaccounted for, with joint investigations conducted from 1996 to 2005. Operations known as \"joint field activities\" were carried out to recover the remains of U.S. servicemen. Between 1996 and 2005, U.S. specialists recovered 229 sets of remains of POW-MIAs, successfully identifying 107. Despite difficulties in operations and negotiations with North Korea, the DOD suspended all joint field activities in 2005 due to concerns over North Korea's nuclear intentions and safety issues. Talks resumed in 2011, leading to an agreement in October 2011, with plans for a mission to return to North Korea in early 2012. However, North Korea's actions cast doubt on the credibility of the agreement. The United States has not undertaken any Joint Field Activities (JFAs) with the Korean People's Army (KPA) since May 2005. In October 2014, North Korean state media warned about the potential damage to U.S. POW-MIAs remains, signaling a desire for broader bilateral negotiations with Washington. The Department of Defense prioritizes the recovery of missing U.S. soldiers' remains from the Korean War. Trump and Kim committed to recovering POW/MIA remains at the June 2018 Singapore summit, with North Korea later turning over 55 cases of remains for repatriation. Some U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts despite turbulent relations. NGOs play roles in capacity building, people-to-people exchanges, agriculture, health, informal diplomacy, information science, and education. North Korea's delay in transferring remains was partly due to a request for payment, which the U.S. does not provide. NGOs engage in diverse activities, including joint ventures between academic and diplomatic NGOs. Several religious NGOs engage in informal diplomacy in North Korea, aiming to provide aid to vulnerable populations and promote peaceful relations. However, their operations have been hindered by U.S. sanctions and restrictions on travel to North Korea. Treaty with North Korea? This CRS report discusses North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, military options, legislative basis for U.S. economic sanctions, cyber capabilities, foreign assistance, U.S.-South Korea relations, ballistic missile defense in the Asia-Pacific region, and technical issues related to North Korea's nuclear weapons."
