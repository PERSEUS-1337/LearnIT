    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The main objectives are to identify and describe major general management laws, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help in considering potential changes to management laws and legislation. The quality and implementation of these laws are crucial for maintaining executive branch accountability and influencing federal agency effectiveness in policy formulation. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories. Functions in the management field refer to specific business areas requiring related skills or groups of people with similar tasks. The report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories, such as marketing, finance, production, and human resources. The compendium's entries profile specific laws, presenting civil service laws according to their codification in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry provides a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and issues, along with source readings for further information. The report also discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, compares management in the public and private sectors, and analyzes major themes in general management laws. The report analyzes major themes in general management laws and discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. It explores how power is shared between the two branches and examines the constitutional principles of separated powers and checks and balances. The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws necessary for executing their powers. The President has authority to manage the executive branch but must ensure laws are faithfully executed. This power is limited, and the President's duty is to ensure officials follow Congress's instructions. The Constitution outlines the separation of powers between the branches and the principle of checks and balances. Article II of the Constitution mentions executive departments and the President's appointment powers. In 1789, Congress established the Treasury Department and set salaries for Secretaries of Treasury, State, and War. The federal government initially had three departments, the Navy Department, the office of Attorney General, and the Post Office. As the nation grew, managing the government became more challenging for elected officials. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an efficient administrative system for the growing nation by creating an independent chief executive, delegating authority to department heads, and implementing a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, continued this framework but faced challenges as the country expanded in size and population. By the 1820s, both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with work, leading to a significant increase in federal employment from 1816 to 1861. The growth of federal employment from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861 led to a more complex organization of executive departments. By 1860, departments consisted of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service. Post-Civil War developments, including industrialization and two world wars, contributed to the rise of the administrative state. Congress delegated legislative authority to administrative agencies by 1946, shifting policy-making and budgeting to the executive branch. The executive branch took on more responsibility for policy making and budgeting, with Congress relying on agencies for expertise. To improve oversight, Congress passed laws like the Administrative Procedure Act, Freedom of Information Act, and established inspectors general. This shift led to increased transparency and accountability in the executive branch. The Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974) were passed by Congress to improve oversight and influence over the budget process. Additional laws like the Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) were enacted to enhance agencies' financial management capabilities. These laws, along with over 90 others, aim to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies, but opinions on their effectiveness vary. The next section discusses the comparison between management practices in the public and private sectors. Scholars caution against applying private-sector management principles to government agencies due to key differences in laws and operations. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre's aphorism highlights the fundamental similarities between public and private management in unimportant respects. Agencies and private-sector companies operate under different laws to regulate behaviors for different purposes. Government has coercive power under the Constitution and public law, while private companies operate under laws to regulate a functioning market economy. Federal government agencies act under authority provided in public law, while private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders. Government agencies differ from private sector organizations in various ways. Unlike private bureaucracies, government agencies cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over revenues, resources, and goals is largely external to the organization, leading to challenges in meeting external demands and measuring performance. This raises public policy issues regarding management practices in the public and private sectors. The compendium of general management laws raises public policy issues for both the laws themselves and specific agencies. Major themes emerge when viewing the laws together, leading to potential management policy options for Congress. The question of how much discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions is heavily debated, with arguments for flexibility and responsiveness. Granting discretion to the executive branch in determining agency actions is a debated issue. Some argue that it allows for quicker decision-making and technical expertise, while others raise concerns about lack of transparency and accountability. Congress faced this tension in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting discretion. In 2002 and 2003, Congress debated granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their HRM systems. Similar tensions arose in 1993 with the NPR's recommendations on procurement policy. Scholars suggest four options for Congress to balance flexibility and accountability when delegating authority to agencies. Congress can establish goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets; require pilot projects; or create \"profit-sharing relationships\" to incentivize agencies to act in ways beneficial to both the agency and the government. Screening and selection mechanisms can be used to ensure effective performance by agencies, while monitoring and reporting requirements increase accountability and transparency. Congress can require agencies to report their \"actions taken,\" milestones reached, and obtained information. The use of information technology and the Web allows for real-time and frequent reporting. Institutional checks can involve additional agencies or entities to veto or block agency actions, such as joint promulgation of regulations. Some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome and reports to Congress may not always be utilized. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch, with examples like the Administrative Procedure Act. Congress can require agencies to report actions taken and milestones reached, using technology for real-time reporting. Excessive reporting requirements may be burdensome and reports to Congress may not always be utilized. Congress has introduced standardization in financial management through laws like the CFO Act of 1990, leading to audited financial statements for executive departments. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended similar requirements to other agencies. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions. Customization can align management with internal and external environments. Congress uses statutes, appropriations, and reports to direct specific actions. Congress uses authorizing statutes, appropriations, and reports to require specific actions for agencies, allowing for customization in general management laws. Examples include exemptions for small agencies from audited financial statements and granting authority to customize HRM systems for DHS and DOD. This mixed approach balances standardization with flexibility. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required executive branch agencies to develop strategic plans but allowed flexibility in compliance. Different approaches like standardization, customization, and mixed have advantages and disadvantages. Customization can reduce transparency and accountability if not monitored effectively. Mixed approaches can face challenges as well. In addition to the three general approaches outlined above, Congress has policy options for avoiding problems related to agency budgets. Decision-making on approaches depends on various factors, and regular evaluation is recommended for improved transparency and efficiency. Analytical support can come from agency management, evaluations, inspectors general, GAO, and external evaluators. Reducing the burden on Congress and stakeholders in monitoring situations, especially in human resources laws, is another option. Efforts to monitor the situation by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies. Fragmentation of civil service laws may hinder monitoring and analyzing government-wide developments. Reporting requirements in areas of customization could reduce the burden for Congress and the public. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, FMS, or others could provide real-time reporting on the Web. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, FMS, or others could report how management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons, despite potential costs for reporting agencies. Functional orientation in organizations can boost efficiency through specialization but may hinder organization-wide coordination if too inward-looking. Functional silos can inhibit an organization's internal development of general managers, leading to missed opportunities. Management literature emphasizes the importance of an integrated, general management perspective over functional perspectives. Different backgrounds and experiences can result in limited views of problems, with individuals defining issues based on their expertise in areas like finance or marketing. The importance of developing a general management perspective is highlighted to integrate multiple functional perspectives for a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach can provide a toolbox of options for addressing management issues in areas such as finance, human resources, and technology. The integrated general management perspective can support and complement individual functional areas to improve overall executive branch management. Integration of various functional perspectives can be achieved through changes in management laws, agency statutes, appropriations, and legislative tools. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial reporting, directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists, and restructuring budget accounts to align resources with agency needs. The integration of various functional perspectives in federal agencies can be achieved through changes in management laws, agency statutes, appropriations, and legislative tools. This could involve aligning resources with individual programs, program evaluations, human resources for contract management, and leveraging various functional perspectives such as information policy, strategic planning, performance measurement, and more. The history of federal government management reform involves efforts to improve agencies' performance, organization, and management practices. Despite challenges, progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management, especially in ensuring compliance with general management laws and measuring agencies' progress. Measurement systems can motivate action but may also create perverse incentives. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported persistent management problems in executive branch agencies in areas like financial management, acquisition, and information technology. GAO released reports detailing \"high risk\" areas and major challenges in federal government management. In 2003, GAO released reports on \"high risk\" areas and management challenges in government. Progress was noted, but much work remained. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations. Members of Congress expressed concerns about government management and recommended actions for improvement. Senator Fred Thompson also addressed government management issues in June 2001. In June 2001, Senator Fred Thompson released a report highlighting urgent federal government management problems faced by the administration of President George W. Bush. President Bush's Office of Management and Budget later introduced the President's Management Agenda (PMA) with five government-wide initiatives to address workforce, financial, and technology issues. The PMA includes quarterly evaluations of agencies based on red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" to track progress in solving management problems. The Office of Management and Budget evaluates agency status and progress on PMA initiatives using red, yellow, or green ratings. Green indicates successful implementation, yellow shows some issues, and red signals serious problems. The initiatives are meant to be mutually reinforcing and utilize general management laws to achieve goals. The PMA initiatives leverage various general management laws to achieve goals, with agencies making significant progress. However, PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch, raising concerns about congressional oversight. The PMA initiatives aim to improve agency performance, but lack transparency in evaluation practices. While standards for success are public, detailed rationales and worksheets are not provided. OMB assessments using the PART tool were more transparent, with detailed evidence released. Subjectivity in stoplight scoring criteria may be a challenge, as independent verification of scores is lacking. The scope of the PMA does not guarantee transparency in evaluations. The PMA does not cover all aspects of general management laws that outside observers might find important, such as contract oversight and small business concerns. Real property management issues are also not addressed. Various entities have tried to influence agencies to improve management practices over the years. Several members of Congress have implemented grading systems to evaluate agency performance in financial management, information security, and compliance with management laws. Options for Congress to ensure agency improvement include maintaining current oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs. The effectiveness of agencies' management practices can be monitored through cross-agency comparisons that motivate action by political appointees and senior officials. Congress could enhance oversight of agency management practices by utilizing tools like GAO and agency IGs to monitor progress in the executive branch's efforts. This option would involve little additional cost and preserve executive branch discretion. Independent verification and validation by GAO and agency IGs could increase congressional confidence in executive branch measurements, but may be perceived as micromanagement. Transparency could be improved by securing access to final PMA stoplight worksheets, opening executive branch management problems to public discussion. Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and reports. This would establish milestones and timelines for improvement, increasing transparency and systematic measurement of management practices. Congress could require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and reports. This would establish milestones and timelines for improvement, increasing transparency and systematic measurement of management practices. Additionally, Congress could mandate the President to address these issues in the government-wide performance plan, potentially making management improvement measurement statutory or more systematic. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency councils of these officers also play a significant role in improving management capacity within executive branch agencies. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions, including chief human capital officers (CHCOs) and chief acquisition officers (CAOs), have specific functions, appointment rules, and reporting relationships. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by an agency head. Certain positions require political appointments, while others can be filled by career employees. Three chief officers must report directly to the agency head, while reporting relationships for others are at the agency head's discretion. The detailed history behind the creation of these positions is not covered in this report. The creation of chief officer positions in executive branch agencies aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives like financial management. Each functional perspective was elevated to a higher position within agencies to tackle long-standing problems. Various chief officer groups were placed in interagency councils by statute or executive order, with memberships and establishment methods varying. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 through executive order to coordinate government-wide activities against fraud and waste. The PCIE, chaired by the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management, provided leverage for agency Inspectors General (IGs) to fight for resources and independence. It also served as a tool to enhance IGs' lobbying power and build informal networks for organizational learning. Standing committees were established by the PCIE to facilitate idea-sharing and cooperation among IGs. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was praised for its positive innovation in allowing IGs to work together effectively on fraud, waste, and abuse issues. However, it was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils - the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) for agency-appointed IGs. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council was also created in 1990 under the CFO Act. The CFO Act of 1990 established the deputy director for management position in the President's Office of Management and Budget, giving them chairperson status over the CFO Council. The DDM is responsible for establishing general management policies in areas such as financial management, procurement policy, and human resources management. In 1994, the council recommended actions to energize itself, including broadening membership and setting their own agenda. The CFO Council also formed committees for special emphasis areas. The CFO Council, established in 1990, has been successful in bringing focus to financial management. Additional chief officer councils were created in 2002 and 2003. Challenges faced by these officers include high turnover among CIOs and difficulties with change management. Despite criticisms, these chief officer positions have been important in improving agency management practices. Some commentators argue that agencies face persistent management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from short-serving political appointees. Management scholars are wary of functional silos hindering a more integrated general management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have been both effective and beneficial, with increasing attention to the benefits of interagency collaboration. Testimony from a former OMB official highlights the importance of councils in improving federal management. Setting up networks of people to share knowledge, best practices, and information is crucial for organizational performance. Attention has been given to knowledge management in management literature, but a narrow functional perspective should be avoided. Re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President is necessary for improving federal executive branch management. Congress may need to consider questions regarding chief officers. Congress may need to consider questions regarding chief officers and interagency councils. Should executive branch agencies have additional chief officers? Are there too many chief officers already? How to preserve institutional memory for political appointees in chief officer positions? Should councils be statutory and funded? Should they be more accountable to Congress? One option is to establish agency \"chief security officers\" to ensure government services are available in emergencies. Many federal agencies may already have systems in place to address security and risk management issues. Establishing statutory Chief Security Officer (CSO) positions could lead to turf battles between CSOs and Chief Information Officers (CIOs). Some argue that creating additional chief officer positions for agencies would be excessive. Observers suggest that agencies lack capacity to evaluate program performance effectively. Congress could consider establishing Chief Program Evaluation Officer (CPEO) positions in major agencies to address this issue. Establishing Chief Program Evaluation Officer (CPEO) positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Critics argue that adding another chief officer position would be excessive. Congress has various options for appointing chief officers, with some positions required to be political and others left to agency heads' discretion. In congressional testimony, witnesses debated the benefits of political appointees in CHCO and CAO positions. While political appointees bring a functional perspective, career officials offer continuity across administrations. The reporting relationships of CHCOs and CAOs vary by agency, raising questions about their effectiveness in addressing management issues. The agency head must ensure that the chief officer has personal access to senior leadership, but adding more direct reports could overwhelm some agency heads. Congress is considering making IG councils statutory to improve training and coordination, although some argue it may limit the President's control. Funding for interagency councils is provided through various methods, such as self-financing via MOUs for IG councils and funding from specific agency budgets for the CHCO Council. Other councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements in recent years. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils, potentially improving institutional memory and continuity between presidential administrations. This could involve maintaining the status quo, making separate appropriations for each council, or implementing combined appropriations to give Congress more control and leverage over council activities. Currently, some councils have no reporting or strategic planning requirements, while others only report to the President or Congress without articulating strategic plans. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could mandate submission of plans or reports to the President or Congress. OMB could be required to submit an overall plan for leading the councils. This could enhance transparency and accountability to Congress, but may limit presidential discretion and increase costs."
