    "content": "The House of Representatives traditionally considers appropriations bills under open rules, allowing for unrestricted debate and amendments. However, in recent years, unanimous consent agreements have been used to regulate the process. Members can propose amendments to spending bills in the Committee of the Whole, subject to standing rules. Amendments can be further amended, and debate is largely unrestricted. Members can also speak on each pending paragraph by offering a pro forma amendment. The House traditionally considers appropriations bills under open rules, allowing for unrestricted debate and amendments. However, in recent years, unanimous consent agreements have been used to regulate the process, limiting amendments and debate time. In recent years, unanimous consent agreements have become routine in the House for regular appropriations bills, replacing open rules and limiting amendments and debate time. This practice was uncommon before the 104th Congress. Unanimous consent agreements in the House for regular appropriations bills act like structured special rules, allowing every Member to have a say in the content. These agreements provide certainty for party leaders, help the Appropriations Committee move bills forward, and allow Members to offer their choice of amendments. Unanimous consent agreements in the House for regular appropriations bills set limitations on amendments, specifying who can offer them and how they are considered. Unlike open rules, UC agreements restrict the scope of amendments and do not require notice. Additionally, they prohibit the division of amendments in the House or Committee of the Whole. Under a unanimous consent agreement in the House, any Member can request that an amendment be divided if it contains multiple substantive provisions. Second-degree amendments are not allowed. Pro forma amendments can be offered by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Only designated members can offer pro forma amendments during the bill reading. This structure gives control of debate time to committee leaders rather than rank-and-file Members. Under a unanimous consent agreement in the House, committee leaders have control of debate time instead of rank-and-file Members. Debate time for each amendment is specified, often 10 minutes divided between a proponent and an opponent. Amendments must address the object described in the agreement. Members can negotiate changes to their amendments as long as they stay on topic, allowing progress on the bill. Some agreements grant the bill manager authority to package amendments en bloc for faster consideration. Unanimous consent agreements in the House allow Members to insert remarks on amendments in the Congressional Record. These agreements may waive points of order against amendments or deem certain amendments automatically adopted. However, they do not provide certainty on the duration of floor consideration for spending measures due to various procedural events that can extend the process."
