    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with foreign firms for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss and unemployment. The impact of offshore outsourcing on the labor market remains uncertain, with some attributing it to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession. Some argue that offshoring contributed to the slow labor market recovery after the 2007-2009 recession. While globalization can cause job displacement, it benefits the economy by offering a variety of products at lower prices and expanding markets for U.S. firms. Services offshoring raises questions about these benefits. Milberg et al. suggest that companies benefit from offshoring service activities by increasing dividends, raising stock prices, and engaging in mergers and acquisitions instead of reinvesting in the U.S. economy. The movement of service jobs overseas may have different implications for the labor market compared to production jobs, with concerns about the impact on college graduates and entry-level job opportunities. Some policymakers support measures to encourage U.S. firms to create jobs domestically rather than overseas. There are debates on whether existing trade adjustment assistance programs can meet the needs of office workers affected by offshoring. Congress aims to assist workers facing job losses due to economic shifts or downturns. The impact of offshoring on U.S. job growth is a key concern among policymakers. The development of outsourcing by U.S. companies is examined to provide context for policymakers dealing with the latest business practices. Information on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s is synthesized to evaluate the adequacy of retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. Overseas relocation of manufacturing work predates services offshoring, with major U.S. companies opening facilities abroad in response to competition and economic shifts. The outsourcing of domestic functions to specialized enterprises and offshoring of jobs to foreign workers has become a permanent reorganization of work in the United States. The 2001 recession led to further efficiencies through technological innovations that allowed for offshoring of service jobs as well. The offshoring of jobs to foreign workers, particularly in IT and IT-enabled roles, has become a permanent reorganization of work in the United States. Events such as the Y2K crisis and the abundance of well-educated individuals in low-wage foreign nations have contributed to the ability of these countries to export services, including IT services, to developed countries like the United States. The globalization of IT services has allowed U.S.-based companies to fragment tasks across borders, including research, design, management, and IT support. This has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States. The extent of job loss due to offshoring is not accurately documented. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended mass layoffs underestimates jobs lost to offshoring, especially at service providers. In the third quarter of 2012, less than 1% of workers affected by extended mass layoffs had their jobs moved out of the country. Forrester Research, Inc. provides additional statistics on offshoring trends. Forrester Research, Inc. projected that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million expected to relocate outside the United States in the first 7 years. This forecasted loss of 300,000 jobs per year was seen as a small share of total U.S. job turnover. Researchers focused on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring, with Bardhan and Kroll estimating over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations being at risk. Researchers estimated that over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could be sent overseas due to attributes like no in-person customer servicing required, routinized tasks, and pay gaps. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers, mainly in industries like information, finance, and professional services. A study by the Brookings Institution projected job losses in 246 metropolitan areas due to offshoring from 2004-2015. The analysis by Jensen and Kletzer identified metropolitan areas vulnerable to services offshoring, with 2.2% of jobs likely to be offshored between 2004 and 2015. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, may lose between 3.1% and 4.3% of jobs. Vulnerable areas tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. Jensen and Kletzer used a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. They found that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries being particularly vulnerable to offshoring. They also ranked the vulnerability of 457 service occupations based on task content, identifying occupational groups like computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and life, physical, and social as having a large share of employment in offshorable categories. In 2005, Jensen and Kletzer identified service occupations vulnerable to offshoring, with a focus on occupations with higher educational attainment. BLS estimated that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring, particularly in professional and technical categories. These offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007. Despite vulnerability, employment in these occupations slightly grew. In the 2001-2007 period, employment in offshorable occupations grew faster than overall service-providing employment, with comparatively greater wage growth. However, the 33 most susceptible service-providing occupations experienced below average employment and wage growth. These vulnerable occupations range from office and administrative support to professional and related occupations. Blinder created an index of offshorability for various occupations, estimating that a majority are non offshorable. Blinder estimated that a minority of U.S. occupations and workers are highly offshorable or offshorable, totaling almost 30 million workers in 2004. He considered this estimate too conservative and included more occupations in the moderate and aggressive estimates, totaling almost 40 million workers or 29.0% of all U.S. jobs. Blinder found that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs and that there is almost zero correlation between skill and offshorability. Blinder and Krueger's analysis found that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, especially in factory and administrative support occupations, as well as in manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Despite fears about services offshoring, only a small fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes work was realized through 2006, possibly due to executives needing to learn how to effectively utilize offshore talent to boost productivity. Some are cautious about moving U.S. jobs abroad as global salaries rise, leading to a shift away from outsourcing as a cost-saving strategy. Companies are now focusing on retaining core functions in-house for better control and knowledge retention. Re-insourcing is becoming more common, with companies like Dell bringing back services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Other firms are also relocating call centers and legal support work to rural low-cost areas in the U.S. Some U.S. manufacturers have brought production back from overseas to rural low-cost areas in the United States, attributing the trend to China's shrinking manufacturing advantages and rising costs for overseas production. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, and Wham-O. Despite some factors that could have slowed offshoring, such as security concerns after 9/11, re-insourcing is becoming more common. After the 9/11 attacks, U.S. airline carriers increased outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas to countries like Singapore and Brazil. Concerns have also been raised about unrest in regions like India and the Middle East. Global software service providers are moving work to countries like Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer Canada for outsourcing due to fewer cultural differences. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. Data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is not regularly collected. Empirical analyses focus on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring, potentially overstating job losses. Other factors influencing employers' location decisions are not considered."
