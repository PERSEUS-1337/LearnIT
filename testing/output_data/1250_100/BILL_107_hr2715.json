    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act\". Findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region lacks sufficient park and recreation lands, which negatively impacts the population's health, well-being, and access to educational opportunities. This issue is exacerbated by the region's rapid growth. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding urban populations in Southern California provides important scenic, environmental, recreational, and economic assets deserving of increased protection. It includes significant examples of endangered habitats and ecotones indigenous to the area, with a key element being the escarpment of the San Gabriel Mountains. The Rim of the Valley Corridor in the San Gabriel Mountains, within the Angeles National Forest, is managed for watershed, recreational, and habitat values. Privately owned lands in the corridor provide additional scenic, environmental, and recreational benefits and should be protected through voluntary incentives. Efforts to protect the area have been hindered by a lack of financial resources and expertise, which could be provided by the Federal Government. The Rim of the Valley Corridor in the San Gabriel Mountains is being studied for possible inclusion as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential National Park System inclusion and involve consultation with relevant advisory committees. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary of the Interior on studying and recommending boundaries for a expanded recreation area. The boundaries should reflect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and include the lands, waters, and interests of the Rim of the Valley Corridor. The Committee, appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, is tasked with recommending boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area within 365 days. Public participation is encouraged in the process. The Committee, appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, includes various city councils and boards from Los Angeles, Ventura, and surrounding areas. The Committee, appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, includes representatives from the city council of Moorpark, the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county, various local councils, and park districts in the region. The Committee, appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, includes representatives from various local councils, park districts, and the city council of Moorpark and the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county. The Committee shall select a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members, serve without compensation but be reimbursed for expenses, require 13 members for a quorum, and terminate upon the submission of a special resources study to Congress."
