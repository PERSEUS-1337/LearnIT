The \"Consumer Lending Education And Reform Act\" (C.L.E.A.R. Act) provides protections for consumers, including new sections defining terms like affiliate, electronic signature, extended payment plan, and home state under the Truth in Lending Act. The term 'home State' refers to the location of a creditor's primary office, while 'home office' is where day-to-day management functions are carried out. 'Interest and fees' encompass charges imposed by the creditor as part of credit extension, excluding default or delinquency fees. The term 'loan store' refers to locations where payday loan applications are received or funds are disbursed. Charges for insufficient funds must not exceed $25 or the amount charged by the creditor's financial institution, and can only be imposed once per item or authorization. Payday loans are closed-end credit transactions with a term of 7 to 90 days, not exceeding $2,000, and with a finance charge exceeding 36% APR. The consumer receives funds and incurs interest or fees, providing a check to the creditor not to be deposited for more than 1 day. The payday lender can initiate debits to the consumer's account after receiving funds. Refinancing involves using one payday loan to pay off another. Protections for consumers include interest and fee caps, limiting charges to 15 cents per dollar loaned and restricting origination fees to 5% for online loans. The payday lender must provide a written loan agreement with specific details, including interest and fee caps for refinanced payday loans. The agreement must be signed by both the lender and the consumer and include mandatory disclosures in English and the negotiated language. The payday lender must provide a written loan agreement with specific details, including total cost of fees, creditor information, and warnings about short-term use. A nonprofit credit counseling agency approved by the NFCC or a government agency can provide information on approved counselors. No criminal prosecution or security interest can be pursued for loan collection. Payday lenders must display notices in English and Spanish in their lending area. The creditor must prominently display warnings about the short-term nature of payday loans and the availability of credit counseling services. Additionally, borrowers cannot be criminally prosecuted or have a security interest taken against them for loan collection. A payday lender must obtain and file a surety bond in specific amounts based on the number of loan stores operated or if loans are offered over the Internet. The bond amount required is $100,000 for fewer than 10 loan stores without online loans, $1,000,000 for 10 or more stores or online loans, and may vary based on state law. A payday lender must file a surety bond with the State attorney general in their home state. Lenders and affiliates with the same home state can aggregate loan stores to determine the bond amount. Lenders must offer an extended payment plan if consumers are unable to repay before the original due date. The payday lender must offer an extended payment plan to consumers who cannot repay before the due date. The lender is prohibited from engaging in collection activities during the extended payment plan period. Refinancing of payday loans is subject to limitations, including a minimum 7-day period before refinancing and a maximum of 2 consecutive refinances. Interest and fees on refinancing cannot exceed the amount permitted under the original agreement. Technical and conforming amendments are made to the Truth in Lending Act, including changes to disclosures and the effect on other laws. Specifically, payday loans subject to section 129B are exempt from certain state laws, such as those requiring minimum loan terms or limiting refinancing. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to exempt payday loans from certain state laws, including those related to check or debit authorization, extended payment plans, and interest rates. States can still enforce requirements under section 129B. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to exempt payday loans from certain state laws. Section 129A addresses fiduciary duty of servicers of pooled residential mortgages, while section 129B provides protections for consumers."
