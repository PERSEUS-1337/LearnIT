    "content": "The Act titled \"HMO Solvency Act of 2000\" aims to ensure the solvency of Medicaid managed care organizations. The Medicaid Program under the Social Security Act now requires medicaid managed care organizations to submit financial reports regularly to monitor solvency and detect insolvency risks. States must review these reports and take appropriate action. Additionally, a preapproval independent audit of operations is necessary before a State contracts with a medicaid managed care organization. The Medicaid managed care organization must undergo on-site audits as required by the Secretary to evaluate its internal structure and financial projections. The audits, conducted by an independent entity, will focus on key business risks such as regulatory risks, competition, provider network, pricing, claims processing, reserves, and information system integrity. Periodic audits under state oversight are also mandated. Each Medicaid managed care organization must undergo periodic audits as required by the state, focusing on changes in subcontracting and ownership. They must also maintain a minimum net worth specified by the state in cash or cash equivalents, which can be met through a guarantor's written guarantee. Medicaid managed care organizations must notify the State 90 days before subcontracting for health care services, provider reimbursement, or other functions impacting enrollees. An independent audit of the subcontractor is required before the subcontract takes effect. Each Medicaid managed care organization must report significant changes in ownership or scope of operations to the State to ensure continuing solvency. Federal solvency standards and additional requirements may be established by the Secretary. The Medicaid managed care organization must report ownership changes to the State for solvency. Additional requirements apply to controlling organizations and entities. The effective date of amendments is determined by the Secretary. The Medicaid managed care organizations must comply with additional requirements under section 1932(b)(9)(C) of the Social Security Act. Existing organizations may be given extra time to meet the minimum net worth requirement. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. The solvency of Medicare+Choice organizations is ensured through the application of specific requirements under Section 1855 of the Social Security Act. These requirements mirror those applied to Medicaid managed care organizations, with the Secretary overseeing enforcement and compliance. The Secretary can waive certain requirements for organizations if they are found to be duplicative and not provide additional protection to Medicare+Choice enrollees. The amendment also applies to organizations receiving capitated payments for Medicare services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The effective date of the implementation will follow a similar process as another section. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will report to Congress on steps taken by States to protect health care providers in case of insolvency of Medicaid managed care or Medicare+Choice organizations. The report will also include recommendations for additional measures to safeguard providers in such situations."
