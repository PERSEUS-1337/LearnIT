    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Local Investment Advisory Board is created with five members, including the Treasurer as the chair. Two members with expertise in investment or finance are appointed by the Treasurer, and two members from local government finance positions are also appointed. Each member serves a three-year term at the pleasure of the appointing authority, with vacancies filled in the same manner for the unexpired term. The Local Investment Advisory Board members do not receive a salary but are entitled to a per diem allowance and reimbursement for expenses. Their main role is to advise and assist the Treasurer in managing investments in the Local Agency Investment Fund. Additionally, a new article is added to the Government Code regarding the Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund. The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund is created for governmental entities to make voluntary deposits for intermediate or long-term investments. Funds can be invested in corporate bonds, government bonds, physical gold, and convertible securities. The Treasurer administers the fund and may refuse deposits that could negatively impact the state's portfolio. The fund's objective is to achieve maximum return with safe management. All investments are held in the Treasurer's vault or with trusted financial institutions. The Controller distributes interest earned from investments to contributing entities proportionate to their deposits in the fund. Reasonable costs, capped at 5% of earnings, are deducted before distribution, or 8% if the Treasury Bill Rate is below 1%. The deduction for reasonable costs from earnings will be credited as reimbursements to state agencies involved in implementing the article. Moneys deposited in the Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund are held in trust and cannot be transferred, loaned, impounded, or seized by the state. Local agencies have the right to withdraw their funds without being affected by the state's budget delays. If funds are withdrawn prematurely, penalties may apply. The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Advisory Board is established with five members, including the Treasurer or designated representative as chairperson. Members must have expertise in investing and finance or be treasurers, finance officers, or business managers from local government entities. Appointed members serve two-year terms at the pleasure of the appointing authority, with vacancies filled in the same manner for the unexpired term. The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Advisory Board members do not receive a salary but are entitled to a per diem allowance and reimbursement for expenses. Their primary purpose is to advise and assist the Treasurer in investment decisions and provide quarterly investment performance reports to the Legislature and Department of Finance."
