    "content": "The United States has two tsunami warning centers managed by NOAA's National Weather Service. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii monitors tsunamis in the Pacific basin, while the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska covers the West Coast and Alaska. The PTWC also monitors the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and Caribbean Sea. Established in 1949 after a tsunami hit Hawaii following an earthquake in Alaska, the PTWC issued warnings until the WC/ATWC was created in 1967. The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) was established in 1967 after the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska. It issues tsunami warnings for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, California, U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, Atlantic coast of Canada, Puerto Rico, U.S. and British Virgin Islands. The NTWC monitors seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood and transmits warnings to NOAA and state emergency centers. The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) issues tsunami warnings for various regions and monitors seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood. NOAA uses water-level data and DART buoys to confirm tsunamis and improve warning accuracy. The DART array was expanded after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to enhance the Pacific Tsunami Warning System. The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) issues tsunami warnings for different regions and monitors seismic data to assess tsunami likelihood. P.L. 109-424 mandates that NWS prioritize maintaining operations of tsunami detection equipment. As of November 18, 2015, 4 out of 39 U.S. buoys were not operational, improving from 9 in March 2015. Inoperable buoys may not hinder tsunami warnings but could result in broader warnings and longer warning durations. NOAA aims to enhance the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) was established to address the tsunami threat in the Pacific Northwest from the Cascadia subduction zone. It assists states in emergency planning, develops coastal inundation maps, and conducts outreach programs. The program aims to raise awareness, improve warning systems, and integrate tsunami planning into multi-hazard programs. NOAA is tasked with enhancing tsunami detection, warning, and mitigation efforts under the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. The NTHMP is responsible for NOAA's tsunami activities, including detection, warning, forecasts, communication, outreach, education, and research. Congress has emphasized the importance of maintaining the DART buoy network. Bills in the 113th and 114th Congress address DART buoy maintenance and availability, along with other NTHMP issues. The House and Senate passed bills to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, authorizing appropriations for the NTHMP through FY2017 or FY2021. The legislation broadens the program to include tsunami research and outreach without fundamental changes. Both versions add research to the title of the act and make section-by-section changes to P.L. 109-424. Both the House and Senate bills aim to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act by adding research to the title of the act and making section-by-section changes to P.L. 109-424. The bills streamline language, update subsections, and focus on improving research efforts related to tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, mitigation, and recovery. The Senate version includes requirements for maintaining DART buoys and a cooperative effort among NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation for seismic information, while the House version does not include these provisions. Both bills rename subsection (c) to the Tsunami Warning System. Both bills aim to improve the Tsunami Warning System by requiring forecasting capabilities for tsunamis in various oceans and international efforts. The House bill adds fail-safe warning capabilities and coordination with NWS, NTHMP, and NOAA, while the Senate bill focuses on using data for new inundation estimates. The House-passed bill emphasizes coordination with the NWS and tsunami warning centers, while the Senate-passed bill focuses on data for new inundation estimates and coordination with the NOAA administrator and other program offices. Both bills aim to improve the Tsunami Warning System by ensuring timely and effective delivery of tsunami warnings through mass communication tools. The House-passed bill and the Senate-passed bill differ in their approach to reporting requirements for the transfer of technology developed under the tsunami research program. The Senate bill includes a provision for congressional notification within 90 days of a significant tsunami warning, while the House bill does not have this requirement. Both bills focus on improving the Tsunami Warning System through coordination with relevant agencies and community-based hazard mitigation programs. The bills aim to enhance tsunami preparedness by providing technical and financial assistance to at-risk areas. They include requirements for regional hazard assessments and support for vertical evacuation structures in communities with limited evacuation time. Section 5 of the bills would expand the TsunamiReady program to include activities like vulnerability research, risk management training, and development of technologies. States could designate at-risk areas based on local knowledge. A report on program accreditation would be required within 180 days. NOAA would be responsible for supporting the research program in collaboration with other agencies. Section 6 of the bill expands the responsibilities of the research program to include mitigating tsunami impacts, improving detection and forecasting abilities, and validating tsunami maps and models. It also allows for a pilot project in the Cascadia region to develop near-field tsunami forecasting capability. The bill aims to develop near-field tsunami forecasting capability for the Cascadia subduction zone, which has the potential for major earthquakes similar to the Great Sendai Earthquake in Japan. It also requires NOAA to coordinate with international entities for technical assistance and establish a new advisory panel. The bill requires the NOAA administrator to designate a Tsunami Science and Technology Advisory Panel to advise on tsunami science, technology, and preparedness. The panel would review federal government activities every four years and submit findings and recommendations to NOAA, which would then report to Congress on progress in implementing the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. The bill includes provisions for developing standards for mapping products, inundation models, and emergency exercises related to tsunamis. It also requires reports to Congress on standardizing tsunami warnings with other natural hazards and on national efforts for rapid emergency response after a domestic tsunami event. The House-passed bill authorizes $27 million annually for tsunami activities for three years, with a minimum of 27% allocated to the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The House-passed bill authorizes $27 million annually for tsunami activities for three years, with a minimum of 27% allocated to the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The Senate-passed bill would authorize the program for six years, from FY2016 to FY2021, with specific allocations for the Tsunami Research Program. Both bills emphasize coordination with state and local emergency managers to improve tsunami education and awareness, as well as the development of resilient communities. Section 11 in the House-passed bill reauthorizes the NOAA administrator to convene a coordinating committee to assist with the administration of the NTHMP, with representatives from states at risk from tsunamis. The House Appropriations Committee authorized $27 million annually for tsunami activities, with a focus on maintaining the DART buoy network. The Senate Appropriations Committee instructed NOAA to maintain funding for the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program at the FY2014 level for FY2015, rejecting a proposal to terminate funding for tsunami preparedness. The House report emphasized the importance of integrating all components of the NTHMP with state-based hazard warning and resilience activities. In FY2015, NOAA allocated $31.4 million for tsunami activities, with $6 million above their request to restore NTHMP grant funds. The FY2016 budget request was $6 million less than FY2015, reducing NTHMP grant funds. NOAA's tsunami program funding historically supports warning, mitigation, and research activities. The Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and the National Buoy Data Center conduct activities funded by NOAA, with funding increasing after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Funding allocation shifted towards warning activities, increasing to 70% in FY2009, while mitigation decreased to 30% and research remained steady at 6-10%."
