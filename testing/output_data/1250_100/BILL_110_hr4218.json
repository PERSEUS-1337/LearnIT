Congress finds that diabetes is a major public health threat in the US, with millions affected and increasing prevalence. Diabetes self-management training is crucial for patients to effectively manage their condition, provided by certified diabetes educators. Diabetes self-management training, conducted by certified educators, helps individuals with diabetes develop skills to stay healthy and prevent complications. Studies show lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%, with even greater effectiveness in older individuals. Patients under the care of a certified diabetes educator show improved diabetes control and health status. Lifestyle changes taught by certified diabetes educators lead to better glycemic control and reduced complications. Evidence suggests prevention rates of 90% for blindness, 85% for amputations, and 50% for heart disease and stroke with proper treatment. Over 20,000 diabetes educators in the US, most certified by the National Certification Board, require specific health care credentials and experience for certification. Diabetes educators certified by the National Certification Board must pass an exam and renew their credentials. They are uniquely qualified to provide diabetes self-management training under Medicare. SEC. 3. Recognition of certified diabetes educators as providers for Medicare diabetes self-management training services. The Social Security Act is amended to recognize certified diabetes educators as providers for Medicare diabetes self-management training services. Certified diabetes educators are defined as individuals licensed or registered as health care professionals, specializing in teaching individuals with diabetes to manage their condition, and certified by a recognized certifying body. The National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators or a certifying body must meet specific requirements for certifying individuals, including having a qualifying credential in a healthcare profession and professional practice experience in diabetes self-management training. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to identify barriers for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in accessing self-management training services. A report on the study must be submitted to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will develop recommendations on effective outreach methods for educating primary care physicians and the public about diabetes self-management training. A report on these recommendations must be submitted to Congress within one year. The amendments will apply to diabetes outpatient self-management training services six months after the enactment of this Act."
