    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 4777 of the Civil Code, requiring written notification to owners and tenants in common interest developments before pesticide application by homeowner associations or their agents, similar to existing law for licensed pest control operators. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including definitions for \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" \"electronic delivery,\" \"licensed pest control operator,\" \"pest,\" and \"pesticide.\" An association or its agent must provide written notice to owners and tenants before applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator. The notice must include information on the pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used, as required by state law. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals allowed for unlicensed use under certain conditions. Risks depend on exposure level, so minimize exposure. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a physician or the California Poison Control System. For more information, contact the County Health Department for health questions or the Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information. The association must provide notice of pesticide application, including date, time, and frequency, to owners and tenants 48 hours in advance. For common areas, notice must be posted or provided to adjacent owners and tenants. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants can be provided through mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery. Owners or tenants can agree in writing to immediate pesticide application upon receipt of notification. Prior oral agreement for immediate pesticide application can be made if requested before the 48-hour notice period. (iii) If an owner or tenant of a separate interest is required to be notified for immediate pesticide application, the association must provide written notice as soon as possible after the oral agreement is made, but no later than the start of pesticide application. A copy of the notice must be attached to the board meeting minutes following the pesticide application."
