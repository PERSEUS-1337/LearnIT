FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that the United States is facing a crisis in writing skills, with a significant number of high school graduates not prepared for college-level English composition. Deficiencies in writing skills have led to high private-sector costs for training. The National Writing Project has been the only national program addressing this issue since 1973, showing improvements in student writing performance. The National Writing Project offers programs to improve teaching in various subjects such as mathematics, science, history, civics, geography, reading, technology, performing arts, and foreign languages. Over 135,000 teachers benefit from these programs annually in nearly 200 sites across the United States and its territories. The National Writing Project aims to expand its network of sites across the US, ensuring high-quality programs for teachers and disseminating effective teaching practices. Coordination with other activities under the Education Act is also a key focus. The Secretary is authorized to award a grant to the National Writing Project to improve the teaching of writing in classrooms. The grant requires the grantee to establish teacher training programs with institutions of higher education or nonprofit providers, with funds used to cover the costs. The grantee must establish teacher training programs with institutions of higher education or nonprofit providers, meeting conditions set by the Secretary for compliance. The teacher training programs will be conducted year-round, train teachers from kindergarten to college, select teachers for a National Writing Project network, and encourage teachers from all disciplines to participate. The Federal share for teacher training programs is 50% of costs to the contractor, with a maximum limit of $150,000 for one contractor or $300,000 for a statewide program. The Secretary can waive this requirement based on financial need. The National Writing Project will establish a National Advisory Board consisting of national educational and writing leaders. The National Writing Project will establish a National Advisory Board comprising educational and writing leaders to advise on student writing issues, review programs, and support development. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of teacher training programs, detailing funds spent and sharing results with Congress. The National Writing Project will establish a National Review Board to review applications for assistance and recommend funding. The Secretary will reserve funds for program evaluation and authorization of appropriations. Authorization of Appropriations: $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding as needed for the following 5 years."
