The Middle Mississippi River and Missouri River Enhancement Project involves developing a plan to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat in the specified river reaches. The project is authorized by the Secretary of the Army. The plan for the Middle Mississippi River and Missouri River Enhancement Project includes activities to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat while considering water-related needs and private property rights. Required activities involve modifying navigation structures and creating side channels for habitat enhancement. The plan for the Middle Mississippi River and Missouri River Enhancement Project includes activities to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat through various methods such as restoration, creation of island and riverine habitats, prioritizing activities based on cost-effectiveness, and implementing physical and biological monitoring for project evaluation. The Secretary will use available funds to carry out these activities as described in the plan. The Secretary will design and construct project features to accelerate activities for fish and wildlife habitat protection in the Missouri River and middle Mississippi River. Integration with other Federal and State activities will be ensured, without affecting existing project authority. The authority for the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project, as well as other relevant authorities, are outlined in this section. No new regulatory authority is conferred, and public participation is required in the development and implementation of the plan. The Secretary must allow public review and comment for activities under subsections (b) and (c), comply with applicable Federal laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, and ensure cost sharing with a non-Federal share not exceeding 25 percent and a Federal share capped at $5,000,000 for each activity. Operation and maintenance of the project are the Federal responsibility. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for the Federal share of project costs from 1999 to 2004. Funds will be managed by the Mississippi Valley Division of the Army Corps of Engineers and distributed to appropriate Districts."
