    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Empowering Parents and Teachers for a Drug-Free Education Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that a significant percentage of high school students in 2001 had used illicit drugs and alcohol, with a notable increase in MDMA use among 12th graders. This substance abuse poses risks to student health, safety, and the learning environment. Illicit drug use among students can lead to serious health effects, brain cell damage, disruptive behavior, lower academic performance, and increased rule-breaking in school. SEC. 3.
