The median household debt among elderly households with debt also rose from $7,463 to $31,050. This trend raises concerns about financial security for retirees, especially as the aging population grows and many rely on fixed incomes like Social Security. Household debt among older Americans has increased significantly from 1989 to 2016, with a higher proportion of elderly households holding debt. This trend raises concerns about financial security for retirees, especially those with limited incomes. Researchers have found that higher levels of debt can lead to increased psychological stress and decreased physical health, which can be more challenging for older individuals with fixed incomes. The report analyzes the increase in debt among households headed by those aged 65 and older, focusing on changes in debt percentages, median and average debts, types of debt, and debt-to-income and debt-to-asset ratios. Major types of debt discussed include residential debt, auto loans, and student loans. Household debt among older Americans has increased significantly from 1989 to 2016, with a higher proportion of elderly households holding debt. The types of debt discussed in this report mainly include residential debt, auto loans, student loans, and credit card balances. Traditional life-cycle theories predict borrowing patterns throughout different stages of life, which align with Americans' debt experiences as shown in the SCF data. In 2016, average household debt increased from $59,134 in 1989 to $110,204. Nonloan debt such as medical debt and past-due bills is not covered in this report. Household debt among older Americans increased significantly from 1989 to 2016. The average household debt nearly doubled for age groups younger than 60, but increased significantly for older age groups. Debt includes mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and credit cards. The share of elderly households with debt and the levels of debt have increased. In 1989, about 37.8% of elderly households held debt, compared to 61.1% in 2016. In 2016, 61.1% of elderly households had debt, with median debt increasing from $7,463 to $31,050. Average debt rose from $29,918 to $86,797. Debt levels peaked in 2010 post-recession, then declined. Older individuals were impacted by job instability and lower-paying jobs post-recession. The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans has affected older Americans, with many experiencing reduced retirement income due to mismanagement of retirement accounts and market fluctuations. Household debt among elderly households has increased significantly, primarily driven by mortgages and auto loans. Elderly household debt in 2016 was mainly from primary residential mortgages (66.8%), followed by other residential debt (13.2%), auto loans (6.1%), student loans (1.5%), credit card balances (3.5%), and other debts (8.9%). Residential loans are seen as long-term wealth builders, less stressful than nonresidential debt like credit card debt. The share of elderly households with various types of debt increased from 1989 to 2016, with median amounts also rising. The share of elderly households with debt secured by a primary residence increased from 15.4% in 1989 to 33.4% in 2016, with median debt increasing from $16,793 to $72,000. Debt among elderly households with residential debt increased significantly from $16,793 to $72,000 in real 2016 dollars. Research suggests that this growth was fueled by the availability of mortgage credit before the financial crisis. Older Americans are carrying more mortgage debt, with recent cohorts buying more expensive homes with smaller down payments. Tightening mortgage standards since 2010 have made it harder for young borrowers to qualify for mortgages, leading to a shift towards older borrowers. A small proportion of elderly households also hold debt secured by other residential properties, with the median debt on these properties increasing from $23,323 to $98,000 between 1989 and 2016. The debt among elderly households increased significantly, with mortgage debt rising from $16,793 to $72,000 in real 2016 dollars. Auto loans also increased, with the share of elderly households holding auto loans rising from 10.3% to 21.2%. Additionally, a small but increasing proportion of elderly households held student loans, with the median amount increasing from $7,463 to $12,000 in 2016. Elderly borrowers are more likely to default on student loans compared to younger borrowers. The number of older Americans having their Social Security benefits offset to pay student loans increased significantly from 6,000 in FY2002 to 38,000 in FY2015. Credit card debt among elderly households rose from 1989 to 2016, becoming the most common type of debt. With higher interest rates on credit card debt, older Americans may struggle to pay off their debts, leading to bankruptcy filings. Elderly debtors in bankruptcy carry 50% more credit card debt than younger debtors, citing interest and fees as main reasons. Measures like debt payment-to-income ratio show debt burden on households, with ratio for elderly households increasing from 8.7% in 1989 to 16.7% in 2010, then declining to 12.4% in 2016. This ratio was lower than nonelderly households in 1989 but the difference decreased over time. In 2016, the debt payment-to-income ratio for nonelderly households was 13.8%, compared with 12.4% for elderly households. Delinquency on loan payments for elderly households was around 3.9% in 2016, fluctuating between 1% and 5% from 1989 to 2016. The debt-to-asset ratio is another measure of debt burden, with more assets reducing the likelihood of default. The debt-to-asset ratio for elderly households increased from 5.1% in 1989 to 9.0% in 2016, with a significant rise in residential debt-to-asset ratio. The proportion of elderly households with a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 50% also increased from 7.4% in 1989 to 11.2% in 2016. In 2016, researchers noted a significant increase in older Americans filing for bankruptcy, with the proportion of filers aged 65 and older rising from 2.1% in 1991 to 12.2% in 2013-2016. Older bankruptcy debtors are in worse financial shape than younger filers, facing challenges in accumulating assets post-bankruptcy due to limited job opportunities and time to build retirement savings. Older bankruptcy filers, especially those aged 80 and older, are more likely to struggle financially compared to younger filers. The proportion of elderly households with debt declines with age, with 70% of those aged 65-74 holding debt in 2016, compared to 42% for those aged 80 and older. This age group also experienced the largest increase in debt among elderly households over the past three decades. The proportion of elderly households with debt increased over time for all age groups. In 2016, households headed by those aged 65-69 had a debt increase from 54.0% in 1989 to 69.8%, while for those aged 80 and older, it increased from 12.5% to 41.5%. Median household debt rose for each age group, peaking around the financial crisis. Elderly households now hold more debt in real dollars compared to three decades ago, with primary residential debt experiencing the largest growth. In 2016, elderly households saw significant increases in various types of debt, including residential debt, auto loans, credit card balances, and student loans. The debt-to-asset ratio also rose for all age groups, with the most significant increase seen in households headed by individuals aged 80 and older. Residential debt accounted for the majority of total debt growth in elderly households. Elderly households experienced significant increases in various types of debt in 2016, with changes in debt varying across the household asset distribution. Wealthy households hold high levels of assets and debt, while elderly households in the middle and top of the asset distribution had the largest growth in median and average household debt. Elderly households in the bottom of the asset distribution usually held the least debt but had the largest debt burden in terms of debt-to-asset ratio. Elderly households in the top asset distribution had the smallest debt-to-asset ratio. Data on household debt by quintile among the elderly population shows an increase in debt from 1989 to 2016 for all asset quintiles. The share of elderly households holding debt increased across all quintiles, with the largest growth in debt probability seen in the second, third, and fourth quintiles. The share of debt-holding elderly households in the highest asset distribution also increased, but not as significantly as those in the middle distribution. Median and average debt among elderly households increased from 1989 to 2016 across all asset quintiles, with the largest percentage increase observed in the middle of the asset distribution. Real median debt tripled for households in the first and fifth quintiles, while it quadrupled for households in the second, third, and fourth quintiles. Average debt also rose, with the lowest asset quintile seeing a twofold increase, and the highest asset quintile experiencing the largest real increase of about $135,000. From 1989 to 2016, elderly households in all asset quintiles saw an increase in average debt. The growth in debt was mainly driven by primary residential debt, credit card debt, and auto loans. Among the lowest asset quintile, primary residential debt contributed to 54% of the growth in average debt, while credit card debt and auto loans accounted for 30% and 20% respectively. Middle- and high-asset elderly households also saw growth in residential debt, with mortgage debt for second homes contributing to the increase in debt for higher-asset households. Overall, growth in debt secured by primary residences accounted for about 80% of the increase in average debt for households in the second through fourth quintiles, and almost 70% for the top asset quintile. Elderly households in the bottom asset quintile had a higher proportion of debt in other forms like lines of credit and installment loans, which decreased from 1989 to 2016. In 2016, these households still had a 43% debt-to-asset ratio, with most debt from nonresidential loans like credit card debt and auto loans. The debt-to-asset ratio decreased for households in the lowest asset quintile over time, but residential debt slightly increased. The debt-to-asset ratio increased for elderly households in the second through fourth asset quintiles from 1989 to 2016, mainly due to residential debt. Debt among older Americans has significantly risen over the past 30 years, with the share of elderly households holding debt almost doubling. Despite the increase in debt, many elderly households have balanced assets to offset it. The debt burden among certain elderly households has increased, with rising debt-to-asset ratios for those aged 80 and older and those with middle asset levels. This may be more problematic for older individuals as they face income risks and higher medical expenses. Additionally, older Americans now hold historically high levels of housing debt, making them more vulnerable in the housing market. Older Americans face historically high levels of housing debt, increasing their vulnerability to housing market swings. Debt management is crucial for retirement security, in addition to income and saving adequacy."
