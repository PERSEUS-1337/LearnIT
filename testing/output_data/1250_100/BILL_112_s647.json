    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior conveyed mineral rights in coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to Montana. Development of these tracts and other energy resources yield public revenues to the State, but the Northern Cheyenne tribal community does not benefit from these revenues despite facing economic hardships. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe lacks revenue sources to address development impacts and previously sued the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State. The Tribe withdrew the suit with commitments for legislation to address coal development impacts. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe asserts claims against the United States for failing to acquire mineral rights when the Reservation was expanded in 1900. If mineral rights are conveyed under this Act, the Tribe will waive all legal claims related to the loss of mineral rights on Reservation land. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the State within the boundaries of the Reservation, as depicted on a specific map dated April 7, 2010. The term \"Federal tracts\" refers to unleased land outside the Reservation, totaling approximately 5,000 acres in specific sections within T. 3 S., R. 44 E. and T. 3 S., R. 45 E., as shown on a map dated March 18, 2011. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to a Delaware limited partnership and any successor to its ownership interest in coal or iron under the Cheyenne tracts. The term \"Reservation\" refers to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"State\" refers to the State of Montana. The term \"Tribe\" refers to the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. SEC. 4. MINERAL RIGHTS CONVEYANCES.\n\nGreat Northern Properties will convey mineral interests to the Tribe, and in return, the Secretary will convey coal rights to Great Northern Properties. The mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe will be immune from state taxation.\n\nSEC. 5. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MINERAL CONVEYANCES. In exchange for mineral conveyances, the Tribe waives legal claims related to private mineral interests. The Tribe and Great Northern Properties must agree on revenue sharing for coal production. Mineral conveyances must be completed within 90 days after notification. Rescission of conveyances is possible under certain conditions. If a portion of mineral conveyances is invalidated by a Federal district court and not reversed on appeal, the Secretary or Great Northern Properties can rescind all mineral conveyances. This rescission would result in the Tribe's waiver being considered rescinded. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS.\n\nNo benefits provided to the Tribe under this Act shall affect their eligibility for any Federal services or programs due to their status as a federally recognized Indian tribe or its members' status as tribal members.\n\nSEC. 7.
