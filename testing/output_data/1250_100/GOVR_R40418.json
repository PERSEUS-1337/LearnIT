    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. Departments like DOD, DHS, HHS, and USDA have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens. These labs are crucial for biodefense efforts but also pose a risk of being a source for biological attacks. In addition to expanding lab capacity, the government invested in research for developing countermeasures and detectors for dangerous pathogens. The increase in federal funding for biodefense post-9/11 led to a rise in high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens. This influx of funds has raised concerns about aging infrastructure and limited research capacity. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories globally has sparked new policy questions regarding optimal size, federal investment, and consolidation. The federal government is focusing on regulating high-containment laboratories due to concerns about accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tighter oversight. This report discusses biosecurity, biosafety, federal oversight, proliferation of these labs, and challenges they face. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between biosecurity and biosafety, highlighting the differences in their definitions and practices. It also mentions the Select Agent Program as a major federal regulatory program addressing biosecurity. The Select Agent Program was established to regulate the possession, transfer, and use of organisms and toxins that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. Following the 2001 anthrax mailings, laws were enacted to increase restrictions on select agents, requiring entities to develop security and biosafety plans. Scientists must register with the federal government to access select agents. Scientists who want access to select agents must register with the federal government, providing information to the Department of Justice for background checks. Permits to handle select agents are nontransferable and valid for five years. Facilities using select agents must develop security plans to protect them from theft. The CDC and USDA review and audit these plans for compliance. Noncompliance with Select Agent Program regulations can result in fines or violations of biological weapons possession laws. Approximately 390 entities have certificates to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff having security risk assessment approvals. The federal government has established a Laboratory Response Network connecting state and local public health laboratories to enhance testing and response capabilities. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some viewing the regulations as too burdensome for research. The Select Agent Program has faced scrutiny from agency Inspectors General for lack of compliance. Investigations found universities and laboratories not fully complying with regulations, leading to some entities withdrawing their licenses. Controls over registered entities were found to be incomplete by the USDA IG. In 2007, CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University due to failure to report occupational exposures. The HHS OIG has fined 12 organizations a total of $1,887,000 for Select Agent regulation violations. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risks and have developed best practices outlined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines. The CDC and NIH have established four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines provide specific protections for handling biological agents at different biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4). The guidelines were developed to protect laboratory workers from the risks posed by various pathogens, with higher biosafety levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. The term \"high-containment laboratory\" typically refers to BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities. The BMBL guidelines outline best practices for safe laboratory operation and criteria for determining the appropriate biosafety level for different organisms and procedures. Some experts suggest that biosafety levels should be considered in relation to both the pathogen and the specific experiment being conducted. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines outline specific protections for handling biological agents at different biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4). The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its potential for transmission and treatment, and the research procedure being conducted. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. Procedures should be conducted at the appropriate biosafety level based on the potential risk of disease transmission and severity. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines recommend handling potentially deadly pathogens at appropriate biosafety levels based on the pathogen and procedure. Some pathogens on the select agent list can be handled outside high-containment facilities, with specific recommendations for handling anthrax at different biosafety levels. While 13 select agents require BSL-4 containment, 30 others may be studied at BSL-2 depending on circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may also work with select agents but are not always subject to select agent regulations. BSL-2 facilities have a small proportion that fall under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is typically voluntary but is widely adopted as facility policy, with some mandatory requirements for federal contracts and grants. Some federal agencies require compliance with BMBL in their laboratories. The BMBL guidelines are important for laboratories, especially those regulated under the Select Agent Program. These guidelines are incorporated into building design standards, grant requirements, and federal regulations related to DNA research. Federal facilities and those built using federal funds adhere to these design standards, which include security requirements. For high-containment laboratories, NIH issues checklists to ensure compliance with these standards. The NIH issues checklists for high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with standards before occupation. This process, known as certifying or commissioning a laboratory, is guided by NIH's Model Commissioning Guide. Other agencies follow similar procedures, contracting specialized companies for commissioning. The guidelines emphasize the need for individuals with extensive experience and technical oversight, such as licensed Professional Engineers. Laboratory facilities receiving federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL to avoid funding withdrawal. Grantee organizations may need to provide evidence of compliance with health and safety standards upon request. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research typically require the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee for oversight. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) oversees compliance with federal guidelines for recombinant DNA research, determining appropriate biosafety levels and precautions. Some suggest expanding IBC oversight to other research with biosafety concerns, but concerns exist about the adequacy of IBC oversight. The BMBL guidelines are incorporated into the Select Agent Program regulations, making compliance with both mandatory for entities possessing select agents. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years due to federal construction and funding for high-containment research facilities. Examples of federal investment in biocontainment laboratories can be seen in various departments such as Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. Some facilities are federally owned and operated, while others are privately owned and operated. The Department of Defense (DOD) has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, focusing on defensive research and developing countermeasures against biological weapons. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the sole BSL-4 lab in DOD, with plans for expansion. Other DOD labs also engage in similar research activities. The DOD has increased its BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space for research on infectious diseases, vaccines, and bioforensics. The DHS established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center to analyze pathogens for identifying biological attack perpetrators. Permanent facilities are being constructed in Frederick, MD for these purposes. The DHS is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). The NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory focused on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. This new facility will expand research capabilities for high-level biocontainment pathogens. The HHS is investing in the construction of BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) across the United States. These facilities will support research on pathogens for biodefense and public health emergencies, and are part of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) for responding to bioterrorism and other health threats. The LRN consists of federal and state public health facilities, medical institutions, and others primarily engaged in diagnostic and public health testing during emergencies. USDA is conducting research in the new NBAF and constructing new BSL-3 laboratories. Academic institutions are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to enhance research capabilities and attract federal funding and faculty. Several academic institutions and private sector companies are expanding their high-containment laboratory facilities, such as the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University. Pharmaceutical companies utilize these facilities for medical testing and product development purposes. Some companies choose to build in-house laboratories, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. Policymakers are grappling with issues such as determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, and balancing the need for additional laboratory space with increased risks. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space due to insufficient infrastructure. The high capital and maintenance costs required federal investment. However, decisions to build and support these laboratories were made without a national needs assessment, leading to concerns of over-building capacity. Lack of information on existing laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but its survey had low response rates and methodological issues. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, criticized by experts. Government Accountability Office noted an increase in laboratories but couldn't determine the exact number. Coordinated planning for future national needs requires a government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies. The continued construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding. Interagency federal planning efforts may help alleviate overcapacity costs, but would require agreement among agencies regarding prioritization and shared use of different agency facilities. The growth of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Congress may need to consider central coordination or agency-level coordination for multi-agency use of these facilities. Events like laboratory infections and improper shipping of select agents highlight the importance of proper management and oversight. Infections, improper shipping, and inadequate biosafety levels have prompted a reevaluation of oversight for high-containment laboratories. There is debate over the need for more federal regulation, with suggestions including mandatory biosafety training and enhanced self-regulatory measures. The expansion of these laboratories offers benefits such as increased research capacity but also raises concerns about the potential for theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has addressed concerns about theft of dangerous pathogens by enhancing physical security. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses at some facilities in the Select Agent Program. More regulatory focus on compliance could help prevent security breaches. Accidents can still occur despite planning to minimize human error or mechanical failure. High-containment laboratories aim to mitigate consequences of accidents, but GAO has testified about inherent risks. The GAO has testified that each high-containment facility has an inherent associated risk, which increases as more facilities are constructed. The incremental risk is difficult to measure and may vary depending on compliance with best practices and regulations. Policymakers may perform a cost/benefit analysis based on the potential benefits of research in high-containment laboratories and the costs of an infectious release. Examples include breakthroughs in biodefense research as benefits and the loss of infected animals or infection of laboratory workers as costs. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the potential for insider threats. Training more individuals in high-containment techniques may increase the risk of malicious intent. The DOJ believes the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist skilled in high-containment techniques, highlighting the international implications of increased high-containment capacity. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about international proliferation of high-containment techniques and information, potentially leading to malevolent use. Differences in biosafety regulation among countries may impact business decisions of pharmaceutical companies, affecting national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. The differences in biosecurity regulation among countries could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. This may lead to restrictions on access to disease treatments during international outbreaks. Concerns about international collaboration and the chilling effect on scientific processes remain ambiguous. U.S. biosecurity standards may influence international partners to develop similar policies. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced local resistance, with some groups supporting the economic benefits while others oppose it due to public health and quality of life concerns. Policymakers have various options to address these issues, including deferring action until expert panels provide recommendations. Expert panels are currently examining issues related to oversight of high-containment laboratories in the United States. Congress could defer additional action until their reports are complete or decide to increase oversight of facilities, pathogens, or personnel. Balancing security controls with research productivity is crucial, with some in the scientific community supporting measures to reduce the threat of terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens while opposing actions that hinder research progress. Policymakers may find current oversight sufficient and argue against additional measures that could impede scientific advancements. Securing high-containment laboratories in the United States may provide less security than focusing on identifying and disrupting potential bioterrorists. Additional resources for intelligence on bioterror groups could be more cost-effective than implementing regulatory frameworks. Expert panels have been examining biosafety and biosecurity issues, with ongoing investigations into high-containment lab proliferation. Congress could defer action until reports are complete or increase oversight of facilities, pathogens, or personnel. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, is tasked with reviewing and evaluating existing laws, regulations, and practices related to biosecurity. Their recommendations on biosafety and biosecurity laws are due soon. The HHS formed the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight in 2007 to address gaps in oversight of high-containment laboratories. The task force includes staff from various government agencies and will present recommendations to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies on dual-use research. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is working on policies for dual-use research, including oversight, a code of conduct, and biosafety training programs. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential recommendations for legislative and executive action. Congress may choose to wait for these recommendations or address the issue independently. Efforts are being made to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories, with calls for a comprehensive inventory. However, compiling such an inventory is complex due to the diverse locations and types of non-federal laboratories. Self-reporting may not be sufficient, and concerns about competitiveness and reporting burden may hinder obtaining a complete inventory. Incentivizing self-reporting could help increase participation. Efforts are being made to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government could help create a comprehensive list of these facilities. Limiting the survey to federal facilities is another option to gather information on high-containment laboratories. Efforts are being made to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government could help create a comprehensive list of these facilities. Congress may need to weigh the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories and consider comparing the information acquired with a government-wide needs assessment to determine if federal capacity exceeds the need. Some policymakers are calling for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to avoid over-building capacity. Incremental increases in existing laboratory space may be more beneficial than constructing new facilities. Some agencies defend the need for new laboratory space, citing outdated infrastructure as a reason. However, without a government-wide assessment, potential synergies or existing infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. A construction moratorium could hinder the federal government's ability to achieve national goals, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability. Delays in construction may also impact planned research activities and impede the development of high-containment laboratory facilities. Some analysts suggest federal licensing and certification for all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations. Options include applying Select Agent Program requirements universally or establishing a separate licensing program with flexible requirements. This would create a uniform security standard or differentiate between labs with select agents and those without. Licensing and certifying high-containment laboratories may not cover all facilities handling select agents, as some pathogens could be manipulated outside of regulated facilities. A more comprehensive approach would involve overseeing all laboratories with BSL-2 or higher containment, but this would increase the number of facilities significantly, including public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Some experts suggest expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, and yellow fever. This would regulate more high-containment facilities under the Select Agent Program, but some scientists are concerned about the current taxonomic definition of select agents hindering research. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Focusing on the Select Agent list would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. This approach could limit disruption of scientific development and public health activities, allowing regulatory efforts to target high-risk laboratories. Background checks for personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded, with the possibility of different levels of screening for access. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, including potential resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may choose to leave research fields requiring high-containment laboratories rather than undergo the necessary government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than those required for access to select agents. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training before accessing select agents and annual retraining. The regulations for accessing select agents require training tailored to individual needs and work risks. Training standards could ensure core competencies are met, with suggestions to expand current biosafety training programs. Different training structures are proposed, from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification. The impact of enhanced biosafety training on reducing laboratory infections is uncertain, as it may not address all biosecurity vulnerabilities. Enhancement of training in high-containment laboratories to address dual-use pathogen concerns and improve biosecurity understanding. Reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, suggested to disseminate information about accidents and near accidents. Challenges in reporting events involving select agents due to potential penalties and professional repercussions. Lack of sharing inhibits improvement of practices to prevent future incidents. Some experts recommend enhancing the reporting system by establishing a database of accidents and remediation efforts to prevent future incidents. This database could be linked to the Select Agent Program reporting requirements, with entries being anonymous or affiliated with the reporting entity. Penalties for reporting accidents should be minimized to encourage reporting. Policymakers need to balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden and potential resistance from scientists. Increasing oversight of the Select Agent Program may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders, with benefits including reducing opportunities for misuse of biological weapons. However, expanding the program could hinder public health response and international collaboration, as critics argue that timely material transfer is crucial for addressing emerging diseases. The program's requirements for laboratory and personnel certification may create barriers to successful collaboration and impede international cooperation on regulated pathogens. The impacts of a licensing and certification regime on the scientific research community may hinder international collaboration and public health response. The licensure requirement could reduce scientific productivity and increase costs for public health laboratories and hospitals. Identifying the most appropriate oversight agency for regulated facilities is a key issue, with USDA and HHS being considered suitable regulators. Historically, biosafety and biosecurity programs focused on laboratory worker safety and minimizing pathogen release risks. Policymakers may consider transferring oversight of pathogen security to another agency like DHS due to increased homeland security concerns. They could either enhance existing authorities or create new ones, leading to a mix of oversight responsibilities. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and potentially consolidating oversight into one agency could facilitate implementation. Limited federal resources have been allocated to overseeing biosafety practices, but expanding the scope for high-containment laboratories would likely require more resources, even under a non-mandatory program. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address the Select Agent Program and the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the program's authorization, expand criteria for select agents, and require improvements recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. Mandatory biosafety and biosecurity training, guidance on monitoring and inventory procedures, and evaluation of current capacity are also proposed. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) directs the HHS Secretary to evaluate current and planned laboratory capacity, share lessons learned, improve guidance on infrastructure, and establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System. It authorizes DHS to award grants for Regional Biocontainment Laboratories and requires a report on integrating the RBL network and the need for additional surge capacity. Biocontainment technologies are globally dispersed. Biocontainment technologies are used globally by scientists in many countries. The threat of a high-containment laboratory being the source of a bioterror weapon may not be fully addressed by domestic policy changes alone. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight for high-containment laboratories, which can impact the choice of policies to address security concerns. Policy options may involve balancing security benefits with regulatory burden, increased federal expenditures, and potential hindrance to scientific progress. Policymakers must reconcile competing national needs when addressing complex policy issues."
