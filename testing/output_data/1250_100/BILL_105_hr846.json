    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The new constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires taxpayers to recognize gain as if the position was sold at fair market value on the date of the constructive sale. Proper adjustments are made for subsequent gains or losses, and the holding period is determined as if the position was acquired on the date of the constructive sale. An appreciated financial position includes stock, debt instruments, or partnership interests with potential gain upon sale. The term 'position' refers to an interest like a futures contract, short sale, or option. A taxpayer is considered to have made a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position if they engage in certain transactions involving the same or similar property. The term 'constructive sale' includes transactions that have the same effect as certain described transactions, with exceptions for marked to market positions, sales of nonpublicly traded property within a year, and transactions closed by year end. The term 'constructive sale' includes transactions where gain or loss is recognized, with exceptions for related party transactions entered into to avoid the purposes of this section. For purposes of this section, positions in interest rates are treated as substantially identical to debt instruments. Definitions include forward contracts and offsetting notional principal contracts. Special rules apply to the subsequent sale of appreciated financial positions after a constructive sale. For determining constructive sales of appreciated financial positions, if a position is sold or disposed of while the transaction is still open, the taxpayer is treated as entering into the transaction immediately after the sale. Trust interests actively traded are treated as stock. When a portion of property is constructively sold, the specific property deemed sold is determined as in an actual sale. The IRS allows securities traders to elect mark to market accounting method without consent, treating securities as not held for investment. Regulations will be prescribed as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. The IRS allows traders to elect mark to market accounting method without consent for taxable years unless revoked with Secretary's consent. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part IV of subchapter P of chapter 1 of the Code. Sec. 1259 introduces constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions, with specific effective date provisions. The amendments apply to constructive sales occurring after the enactment of the Act, or after January 12, 1996, and before the enactment date if certain conditions are met. The constructive sale provisions apply as if the sale occurred 30 days after the enactment of the Act. In cases of a decedent dying after the enactment, if a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position occurred before the enactment date and gain has not been recognized, the position shall be treated as property constituting rights to receive income in respect of the decedent. The amendment allows securities traders to elect to be treated as dealers for taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. Taxpayers can spread adjustments over a 5-year period if they change their accounting method under section 475(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON EXCEPTION FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER SECTION 351. The determination of whether a company is an investment company shall be made by taking into account all stock and securities held by the company, whether or not readily marketable. Effective for transfers after the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such date."
