    "content": "The \"Systemic Risk Mitigation Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. Definitions are provided in Section 2. In this Act, the term \"average daily closing price\" refers to the average daily closing price of a credit default swap on long-term subordinated debt of a bank holding company over a 30-day period. The Board will develop a method to determine this price and calculate the average accordingly. The term \"bank holding company\" has the same meaning as in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, with total consolidated assets over $50,000,000,000. The \"Board\" refers to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The term \"credit default swap\" is also defined. (4) Credit default swap refers to a swap agreement under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. (5) Long-term subordinated debt is unsecured debt with maturity over 5 years. (6) Stress test evaluates a bank holding company's capital to absorb losses in adverse economic conditions and meet systemically important obligations. Regulations will define \"systemically important obligation\" and \"tier 1 capital\" has the same meaning as in part 225 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations. SEC. 3. MARKET-BASED TRIGGER TO DETERMINE ADEQUACY OF CAPITAL. Market-Based Trigger: If a bank holding company's average daily closing price exceeds 50 basis points, the Board will notify the company to raise additional tier 1 capital. The company must submit an action plan within 14 days and implement it within 30 days after approval by the Board. If a bank holding company's average daily closing price exceeds 50 basis points, the Board will notify the company to raise additional tier 1 capital. The company must submit an action plan within 14 days and implement it within 30 days after approval by the Board. The company and the Board may repeat the process until the closing price is less than or equal to 50 basis points. A bank holding company can appeal the Board's findings and request a stress test, which will toll any deadlines until the appeals process is concluded. If a capital deficiency is found after the stress test, the Board will take further action. If a bank holding company's average daily closing price exceeds 75 basis points, the Board will notify the company and require an action plan. Dividends may be suspended, and receivership may be considered if the price exceeds 100 basis points. If a bank holding company's average daily closing price exceeds 100 basis points, the Board shall conduct a stress test. If a capital deficiency is found, the company must submit and implement an action plan within 14 days. If the price exceeds 100 basis points, the company will be placed into receivership. Failure to submit an action plan may result in consequences. The Board may place a bank holding company into receivership if it fails to submit an action plan within the required time period. Holders of long-term subordinated debt will receive either 80 percent of the debt's face value or the residual value of the company after other creditors' claims are satisfied. Each bank holding company must issue and maintain long-term subordinated debt equal to or greater than 15 percent of its total consolidated assets by a specified deadline. If a bank holding company fails to meet the requirement, it must submit a plan to the Board. This section will take effect 2 years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. REPEAL. Prohibitions on proprietary trading and enhanced prudential standards are repealed."
