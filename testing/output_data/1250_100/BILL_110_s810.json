There is consensus in the scientific community that hands-on laboratory experience is essential for learning science. However, the quality of laboratory experiences in high schools is currently poor, hindering research on how to improve them. Higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and schools with higher concentrations of poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. The Government Accountability Office reported that schools with a minority student population greater than 50.5 percent often do not meet functional requirements for laboratory science. 40 percent of college students who left the science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research and projects to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The grant program aims to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance laboratories in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program to improve mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level through grants for equipment, facility maintenance, teacher training, and instructional program development. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program to improve STEM instruction at the secondary school level through grants for equipment, teacher training, hands-on laboratory experiences, and assessment of funded activities. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 establishes a pilot program for STEM instruction at the secondary school level. Grants under the program must be made to partnerships that include an institution of higher education, a high-need local educational agency, a business or nonprofit organization, and may include other entities. The Federal share of the cost for activities funded by the grants cannot exceed 50 percent. The National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in STEM subjects. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for the following years."
