    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with funding for other energy technologies over the past 71 years. Final funding amounts for FY2017 and FY2018 were established by specific acts signed by the President. The report compares Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with other energy technologies over the past 71 years. Funding totals in real terms since 1978 are presented in figures and tables, showing relative shares of spending for each period. Charts display cumulative DOE spending for different energy sources from FY2009 to FY2018, FY1978 to FY2018, and FY1948 to FY2018. The post-World War II era saw R&D applied to peacetime energy source development. During the post-World War II era, the federal government focused on R&D for energy sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for nuclear energy development. In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration and Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) were created. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977 to oversee all energy R&D programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977 to oversee energy R&D programs, including nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies from FY1948 to FY1977. Funding for all four main energy technologies increased significantly during the 1970s in real terms. DOE has been the main source of energy R&D funding since FY1978. Funding for energy technologies peaked in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 dollars) before dropping to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. There was a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion (2016 dollars)."
