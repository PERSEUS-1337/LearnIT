    "content": "Increased credit for medical research. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the credit for medical research expenses, substituting 40 percent for 20 percent for qualified medical research expenses. Qualified expenses include those for developing medical products for human disease, sickness, or injury. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 increases the credit for medical research expenses to 40 percent for qualified expenses related to developing medical products for human disease, sickness, or injury. Expenses incurred before the approval or licensing of the product are excluded from the credit. The term 'qualified medical research expenses' includes expenses for preclinical and clinical testing aimed at developing new uses, characteristics, or delivery forms for existing medical products. The term 'product' refers to drugs, biologics, medical tests, or devices. The medical research base amount is determined based on the average of qualified medical research expenses during a specified base period. The base period includes the most recent taxable year ending at least 6 months before the current year and the 4 preceding years. Regulations may allow for disregarding de minimis amounts of expenses. The medical research base amount is determined based on the average of qualified medical research expenses during a specified base period. For the first 2 taxable years, it is 60 percent of the taxpayer's qualified medical research expenses. Research conducted by academic and medical institutions involves different percentage allocations for qualified research expenses. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a qualified academic institution for medical research purposes, including educational institutions, cancer research institutions designated by the National Cancer Institute, and nonprofit independent research organizations. The curr_chunk explains the eligibility criteria for nonprofit independent research institutions and qualified nonprofit medical institutions for the medical research credit. The credit determined under this subsection is based on a percentage of the taxpayer's qualified medical research expenses, with different rates for different levels of gross receipts. An election under this subsection applies only to the taxable year for which it is made. Coordination is required in determining the amount of the credit allowed for expenses not eligible for the increased credit under this subsection. The increased credit under this subsection excludes qualified medical research expenses for computation of qualified research expenses, base amount, and alternative incremental credit. The amendment applies to taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
