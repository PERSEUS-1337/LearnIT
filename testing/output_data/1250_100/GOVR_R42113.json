In the post-World War II era, corporate tax revenue peaked in 1952 at 6.1% of GDP and has since declined. Currently, corporate tax revenue is around 1.3% of GDP, but projections suggest it may increase to over 2.4% as the economy recovers. Overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP, with individual tax revenues also stable at around 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. At its peak in 1952, the corporate tax generated 32.1% of all federal tax revenue. The corporate tax revenue peaked in 1952 at 32.1% of all federal tax revenue. Currently, it only accounts for 8.9% of federal tax revenue. The decline in corporate tax revenues may be due to a reduction in tax rates, the corporate tax base, or both. Lower average effective corporate tax rates have contributed to the decline in revenue. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower corporate tax revenue. Factors driving this decline include a reduction in the top statutory rate and the allowance of investment tax credits between 1962 and 1986. The investment tax credit between 1962 and 1986, Section 199 deductions since 2004, and changes in depreciation rules have all contributed to reducing the effective corporate tax rate. Bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009 also temporarily enhanced depreciation deductions. The effective corporate tax rates have generally fallen over time due to factors like accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits. However, other factors like inflation and foreign tax credits have had small effects on the effective tax rate. Recent spikes in the effective tax rate occurred around 2000 and 2007 during recessions when businesses were experiencing losses. Carrying back losses to offset income from previous years allowed some firms to receive tax refunds, reducing their average effective tax rate. The effective corporate tax rates have fallen over time due to factors like accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits. Recent spikes in the effective tax rate occurred around 2000 and 2007 during recessions when businesses were experiencing losses. Congress extended the carryback period in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. The nonfinancial corporate tax base has shrunk as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to the corporate income tax system. The distribution of business income in the United States shifted from corporations to partnerships and S corporations, leading to a smaller corporate tax base. C corporations decreased from 17% to 6% of all businesses by 2007, while S corporations increased from 4% to 12%. Legislation changes, like the Tax Reform Act of 1986, incentivized businesses to organize as S corporations. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has decreased, impacting the tax base. Economists use the profit to asset ratio to measure how well resources are used to generate profits. Corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966. Falling profitability has had a greater impact on corporate taxes than changes in tax rates. The reasons for the decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability are being explored. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability may be attributed to shifts in industries, age of corporations, profit-shifting to lower-tax countries, and income manipulation for tax purposes. Research shows evidence of significant profit-shifting behavior among multinational corporations. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to factors such as decreasing effective corporate tax rates, a shift towards pass-through business structures, and falling corporate sector profitability. Understanding these reasons is crucial for the ongoing tax reform debate, which focuses on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base by eliminating deductions and exemptions. The effective tax rate is usually below the statutory tax rate, suggesting a possible reduction in the top corporate tax rate. Research indicates that reducing the rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing corporate tax expenditures and making changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Business tax reforms may lead to some activity returning to the corporate sector, broadening the tax base. Additionally, reforms to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas could reduce profit shifting and expand the domestic corporate tax base. The average effective tax rates are calculated using specific data sources and equations that identify the level of government. The equation for the average effective corporate tax rate (AECTR) includes federal and state/local variables for each year."
