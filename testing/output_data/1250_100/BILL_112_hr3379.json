Section 110 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include provisions for Federal Plans in case a State fails to submit a required plan or if the submitted plan does not meet minimum criteria. The Administrator is authorized to promulgate a Federal implementation plan under certain conditions. The Clean Air Act allows for Federal Plans to be implemented if a State fails to correct deficiencies in their submitted plan or if the plan is not approved by the Administrator. Additionally, Federal implementation plans can be promulgated if a State fails to consider specific factors outlined in the Act. The Clean Air Act allows for Federal Plans to be implemented if a State fails to correct deficiencies in their submitted plan or if the plan is not approved by the Administrator. Federal implementation plans must comply with specific requirements outlined in the Act, with a 5-year grace period before enforcement. The Administrator will approve a State submission if it meets all applicable requirements, with limited review. The Administrator will limit the review to whether the State considered specific factors in preparing and submitting the implementation plan. Visibility plans must be approved if they meet the required factors. Partial approval and disapproval may occur if only a portion of the plan revision meets all requirements. The Administrator will only find an implementation plan substantially inadequate if it fails to meet visibility standards or other requirements under the Act. The Administrator may find a State's plan inadequate if it fails to consider specific factors. States can request revocation of existing plans and submit new ones. Upon revocation of a State's plan, the State must submit a visibility plan or revised best available retrofit technology determination to the Administrator. SEC. 3.
