    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, especially among children and young adults. Approximately 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but lack a suitable match. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been successfully used in treating these conditions, with over 14,000 transplants performed globally in the last 20 years. Cord blood cells have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children, with lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have been effective in treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells that can differentiate into every cell type in the human body, decrease inflammation, and stimulate tissue repair. Clinical research is ongoing to study the use of cord blood cells to treat various conditions such as type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and cerebral palsy. Preclinical research shows promise in treating hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart defects. Over 90% of cord blood cells from births in the US are discarded as medical waste, with limited information provided to parents about banking options. The Institute of Medicine recommended clear information for donors regarding cord blood cell options. The Institute of Medicine recommended that donors be provided with balanced information on cord blood cell banking options and that informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery. SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will include information on the value and uses of cord blood, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, public vs private cord blood banking, and options for mothers regarding stem cells in cord blood after delivery. The publication on umbilical cord blood will cover options for stem cell storage, medical processes for collection, family history criteria, ownership options, and cost considerations. The publication covers the average cost of public and private umbilical cord blood banking, availability of public and private cord blood banks, including lists of accredited private banks and public banks in the US, and information on free family banking and sibling donor programs. It also explains which racial and ethnic groups are in particular need of publicly donated cord blood samples based on medical data. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document regarding cord blood disposition to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. Certain professionals are required to disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after enactment, healthcare professionals must provide pregnant women with information on umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent must be obtained before delivery regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells. The text chunk discusses the requirement for healthcare professionals to comply with providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women and enforcing these requirements. If a State fails to comply, there may be a reduction in payment under the Act. The text chunk addresses the amendment to the Act regarding informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in healthcare plans. It includes changes to sections 1902(a)(74) and 1903(aa) and updates to employer group health plans under ERISA to comply with the new requirement. The amendment requires healthcare professionals providing prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with certain requirements. The effective date applies to agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will develop professional educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Grants may be provided for targeted education on cord blood stem cells to various groups, including health care providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood stem cells. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
