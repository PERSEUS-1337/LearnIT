    "content": "The United States, Iraq's neighbors, and Iraqi political groups have different views and interests regarding Iraq's future. Iraq's neighbors are focused on influencing changes in regional strategic balance, sectarian violence, terrorist groups, refugees, and economic opportunities. The removal of Saddam Hussein upset the political and economic balance in the Persian Gulf region, impacting long-term relations with neighbors. The removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq not only shifted the regional balance of power but also created new economic opportunities. The Shiite-dominated government in Iraq has ties to Iran, leading to concerns among regional powers. The U.S. no longer needs a policy of containment towards Iraq, focusing instead on stabilization efforts, counterterrorism, and potential confrontations with Iran. The empowerment of Iraq's Shiite Arabs and close relationships between the Iranian government and some Iraqi and non-Iraqi Shiite political parties and armed groups have raised concerns among Iraq's neighbors about a potential \"Shiite crescent.\" Sunni Arab governments and religious figures have accused Iraqi Shiite militia groups and security forces of targeting Sunni Arab civilians, while Shiites outside of Iraq fear the targeting of Iraqi Shiite civilians by Sunni Arab-led insurgent groups. The strengthening of Iraqi Shiite political parties and the Shiite hawza in An Najaf raises concerns among Sunni Arab-led governments about potential Shiite influence in the region. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain fear that empowered Shiite populations may become more politically active or hostile, following the example of Iraq. Sectarian tensions in Bahrain and scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority population persist despite recent reconciliation efforts by King Abdullah. Iran also worries about challenges to its religious authority from clerics in An Najaf. An Najaf poses a challenge to the religious authority of the hawza in Qom. Iraq's neighbors are concerned about the potential for terrorist organizations to exploit the country's security vulnerabilities. Al Qaeda in Iraq, under Abu Musab al Zarqawi, created a regional terrorist network responsible for attacks in Iraq and Jordan. Ethnic nationalist groups like PMOI/MEK/MKO, PJAK, and PKK also pose transnational threats to Turkey and Iran. These groups could contribute to regional instability if they provoke hostile responses from Iraq's neighbors. The activities of foreign fighters in Iraq have raised concerns internationally, as they may attempt to ignite insurgencies and terrorist campaigns in other countries. Recent research shows that experienced fighters have contributed to the lethality of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Continued coordination between the United States, regional governments, and the international community is needed to prevent the reverse flow of foreign volunteers. The conflict in Iraq has led to a humanitarian crisis with millions of displaced Iraqis and non-Iraqi refugees suffering. Iraq's neighbors are under pressure to assist these displaced populations. The United Nations is calling for a more coordinated relief response from the international community. The potential for renewed civil conflict in Iraq could further exacerbate the situation. Source: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Iraq Fact Sheet, September 2008 and July 31, 2009. Iraq's energy resources and geographic location make it an attractive economic partner for its neighbors and the international community. However, postwar violence and lack of commercial laws limit trade and investment potential. Bilateral and regional trade has increased, especially in energy resources, but violence hinders investment. Rehabilitation of Iraq's oil infrastructure is expected to increase oil availability in the region, affecting OPEC quotas and global energy markets. Political diversity in Iraq complicates the situation. The diversity of political actors in Iraq and regional policy issues complicate predicting events in Iraq. Changes in U.S. policy and circumstances since 2003 have influenced Iraq's neighbors' perspectives. Challenges faced by the United States and Iraq's neighbors are illustrated using a scenario-based framework. Concerns from 2003 to 2006 included the Sunni-led insurgency, foreign terrorist presence, and organized criminal activities. Sectarian violence escalated after a Shiite mosque bombing in 2006, leading to retaliatory attacks between Sunnis and Shiites. The violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq escalated after a Shiite mosque bombing in 2006, leading to a civil war. Efforts by U.S. forces in 2007 helped reduce sectarian violence, attributed to the troop surge and ceasefire of the Shiite Jaysh al Mahdi militia. Iran and Turkey have engaged with Iraq's Kurdish and Shiite Arab populations to secure their interests. Iran's support for Iraq's Shiites may be fueling Sunni-led resistance activities. Iraq's Kurds are cautious of Turkish actions due to ongoing military operations against the PKK. Members of Congress may need to consider responses to neighboring countries influencing Iraq. Sunni Arab neighbors have limited engagement with Iraq and fear chaos if the government fails. Arab citizens are divided on the impact of the U.S. military presence in Iraq. Many oppose it, while others see the Iraqi government as illegitimate. The Bush and Obama Administrations claimed success in improving security in Iraq through strategies like the troop surge and the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement. U.S. troops have withdrawn from Iraqi cities, with further withdrawals planned after the 2010 Iraqi elections. The focus is shifting from combat to support and training roles. The Obama Administration plans to shift U.S. troops from combat to support and training roles in Iraq, with a target of 35,000-50,000 troops by August 31, 2010. The goal is a full withdrawal of U.S. forces by December 31, 2011, based on sequential reductions and building Iraq's security forces. Critics argue that political reconciliation among Iraq's communities has not been achieved despite security improvements. Some neighboring countries support an ongoing U.S. presence in Iraq, while others, like Iran and Syria, are concerned about it. The United States and Iraq's neighbors are concerned about the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq. Agreements state that the U.S. should not use Iraqi territory for attacks or seek permanent bases. Neighbors seek a strong central government in Iraq to prevent violence and terrorist threats. Some analysts argue for a united, democratic Iraq. Analysts argue that a united, democratic Iraq could have a \"demonstration effect\" on neighboring countries, pressuring them to allow similar political representation. Key unresolved issues include Iraq's role in OPEC, military projection, presence of foreign military bases, and relations with regional and global powers. Official statements and analysis illustrate regional governments' perspectives on Iraq. Iran's interests in Iraq are driven by regional ambitions and the desire to influence disputes with the United States and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Iran seeks to prevent Iraq from posing a threat and views Iraq's Shiite Arab population as a strategic asset. Iran sees Iraq's Shiite Arab population as a strategic asset and aims to maintain control through support for Shiite parties. Iran's aid to Iraqi militias has hindered U.S. stabilization efforts, leading to heightened threat perceptions. However, internal competition among Shiite factions in Iraq poses challenges for Iran's influence. Iran's strategy in Iraq led to the victory of the Shiite Islamist bloc in the 2005 National Assembly elections. The bloc includes Iran's proteges, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Dawa party. The Prime Minister, Nouri al Maliki, is from the Dawa Party, while the Sadr faction withdrew from the bloc in 2007. The ISCI is considered the most pro-Iranian of Iraq's Shiite political groups. The Sadr clan has ties to Iran, with Moqtada al Sadr's great uncle being a political ally of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. In the 2009 elections, Maliki's faction outperformed ISCI in Shiite provinces, leading to setbacks for Iran. ISCI struggled to form coalitions and determine provincial governors. The U.S. Defense Department report acknowledged Tehran's setback in the elections. The U.S. Defense Department report noted that Tehran faced setbacks in the elections, with parties favoring a strong central government gaining victories. Iran's influence in Iraq remains significant despite some reductions in support for militants. The report also highlighted Iran's backing of Sadr's religious studies in Qom, Iran. The emergence of Iraqi nationalism since 2007 has limited Iraq's flexibility in compromising with Iran on certain issues. Iraqi officials took responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war, signed military cooperation agreements with Iran, and allowed Iranian consulates in several Iraqi cities. Iraq's Foreign Minister supported Iran's right to peaceful nuclear technology. Iran has not returned Iraqi aircraft taken during the Gulf War. The ICRC is working to resolve missing persons from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran alleges Iraq is not doing enough to deny support for militants. Iraq and Iran have resolved most territorial disputes, including the water border issue. However, tensions remain over Iran's allegations that Iraq is not cracking down on Iranian Kurdish separatist group PJAK. The U.S. has designated PJAK as a terrorism-supporting entity. Iraq now has more control over U.S. operations in the country following the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement. Foreign Minister Zebari has urged Iran to finalize border demarcations. Iran has urged Iraq to expel the Iranian opposition group PMOI from Camp Ashraf near the Iraq-Iran border. Despite Iraqi leaders expressing their desire for the group to leave, the State Department stated that Iraq had pledged to respect the residents' human rights and not force them to go to Iran. On July 28, 2009, the ISF tried to establish control over Ashraf by setting up a police post. On July 28, 2009, the ISF attempted to assert control over Ashraf by setting up a police post inside its main gate. PMOI residents resisted, resulting in violence with at least 10 residents killed and others injured. The U.S. considers the issue of Camp Ashraf an Iraqi matter, while Iran has sought to influence outcomes in Iraq through close ties with Iraqi leaders. Reports suggest Iran tried to derail Iraq's acceptance of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. Iran may have tried to bribe Iraqi parliamentarians to vote against the agreement. Iran's Supreme Leader warned Maliki that the U.S. cannot be trusted. Maliki has visited Iran multiple times to consult on major issues and sign agreements. The visits resulted in agreements on various issues such as cross-border migration, intelligence sharing, pipelines, mine clearance, and electricity purchase. Iran and Iraq have strengthened their trade relations, with Iran providing credits for exports to Iraq and agreements for cooperation in various sectors. In return, Iraq awarded a $1 billion contract to an Iranian firm for reconstruction projects. Bilateral trade has reached $4 billion, with plans to increase it to $5 billion. In 2009, Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki visited Iraq to increase trade to $5 billion annually, focusing on oil and electricity. The US and Iran held bilateral meetings in Baghdad in 2007, but talks were postponed and eventually halted by Iran due to civilian casualties caused by US forces in Sadr City. Iran may have believed it did not need to make concessions to the US as the US finalized its withdrawal plans from Iraq. Iran finalized its general withdrawal plans from Iraq, signaling a diminishing of U.S. influence. Iran may fear a strong Arab nationalist leader in Iraq, which could challenge its influence. A stable Iraq could also impact Iran's position in the region. Iran's influence in Iraq remains substantial, evidenced by Iraq's attempts to control Camp Ashraf. However, some aspects of Iranian influence, like sustaining Shiite militias, are waning. Experts predict Iran's influence will fade as Iraq asserts its nationhood and Arab-Persian differences reemerge. Turkey's relationship with Iraq was defined by fears of Kurdish separatism and ambiguity towards Saddam Hussein's regime. Turkey allowed U.S. and British planes to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq post-1991 Gulf war, protecting Iraq's Kurds and monitoring Iraq's armed forces. Despite Turkish unease, an autonomous Iraqi Kurdish administration developed, with Turkey later expressing doubts about U.S. regime change plans for Iraq. Turkey refused to authorize the deployment of U.S. forces for a northern front against Iraq in 2003. Post-war, Turkey seeks a stable, democratic, and unified Iraq, emphasizing territorial integrity and regional stability. Concerns include Iran's influence over a Shiite-dominated Iraq, chaos post-U.S. military withdrawal, and the need for Iraqi reconciliation and participation in the Baghdad government. Turkey supports the federal structure of Iraq and constructive Kurdish involvement. Turkey's interest in Iraq's territorial integrity is driven by the desire to prevent the emergence of an independent Kurdish state that could inspire separatist movements within Turkey. Turkey has a history of conflict with the PKK and sees Iraq as a strategic partner, with developments in Iraq affecting Turkey as well. Turkey also aims to strengthen economic ties with Iraq and promote regional stability by assisting in reducing tensions between Iraq and Syria. The PKK, listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department, has around 4,000-5,000 members, with 3,000-3,500 believed to be in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq. Turkey has deployed military forces in northern Iraq to combat the PKK threat and has engaged in diplomacy with Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish officials. Ankara asserts its right to defend itself if Iraq fails to stop terrorists from using its territory against Turkey. In 2006, Turkey mobilized military forces on the border to signal impatience with the PKK presence in northern Iraq, prompting the appointment of a Special Envoy for Countering the PKK by the Bush Administration. In 2007, the U.S. appointed a Special Envoy to coordinate with Turkey and Iraq to combat the PKK threat. However, the envoy, Ralston, failed to achieve concrete results and resigned in October 2007. Turkey refrained from acting against the PKK for a year due to his appointment. In response, Turkey increased military operations within its borders and conducted raids in northern Iraq. Later in 2007, diplomatic efforts were made between Turkey and Iraq to counter terrorism, including the PKK. In 2007, diplomatic efforts were made between Turkey and Iraq to counter terrorism, including the PKK. President Bush invited Prime Minister Erdogan to the White House to address the PKK threat, referring to them as \"our common enemy\" and promising real-time intelligence sharing. This led to increased cooperation between the United States and Turkey in addressing the PKK issue. After the White House meeting in 2007, Turkish forces conducted air strikes against the PKK. A week-long incursion into Iraq's Zap area followed, degrading PKK facilities. Turkish officials were pleased with U.S. intelligence assistance but displeased when urged to withdraw troops. Efforts to ease tensions included a visit by Iraqi President Talabani to Ankara and a visit by Prime Minister Erdogan to Iraq in 2008. During the visit, the Turkish President Gul met with Iraqi leaders and discussed the PKK issue. Despite diplomatic efforts, terrorist attacks by the PKK continued, leading to casualties for Turkish forces. In response, Turkey conducted air strikes and extended its authority for cross-border operations into northern Iraq. Additionally, the Turkish government engaged with Kurdish leaders to address security concerns. During a visit in October 2008, authorized Special Envoy to Iraq Murat Ozcelik and a delegation met with KRG leader in Baghdad. Progress in diplomatic relations between Kurdistan region and Turkey was reported. A trilateral mechanism involving Turkey, Iraq, and the United States was established to counter terrorism, with KRG representatives participating. In August 2009, Massoud Barzani stated that the PKK cannot sustain armed struggle and encouraged peaceful means for Kurdish rights. Turkey extended the mandate for cross-border operations into northern Iraq in October 2009, with multifaceted security cooperation. Military training and cooperation agreements were signed between Turkey and Iraq in June 2009. The High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council, established in October 2009 by an independent Turkish think tank, aims to create a common security framework, political dialogue, economic interdependence, and cultural cooperation. Turkey is concerned about the Iraqi Turkomen, who face displacement and outnumbering by returning Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq. Ankara advocates postponing a referendum on Kirkuk's fate, fearing it may favor Kurds over Turkomen residents in the oil-rich city. Turkish officials are concerned about the fate of Kirkuk, as it could potentially benefit Kurdish residents at the expense of Turkomen. However, Iraqi officials have postponed the referendum and a national census that would impact the city. Turkey remains vigilant but hopes for closer economic ties with Iraq, as they are important trading partners. Plans for a free trade agreement and a common industrial zone on the border are in progress. Cooperation in the energy sector is also increasing, with the Turkish Petroleum Company involved. In 2008, Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO) and BOTAS signed an agreement with Shell Oil Company for oil exploration in northern Iraq. The Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is a source of income for both countries, with plans to increase capacity. Oil flow from KRG-administered fields to Turkey is expected to double by mid-2010. Turkey wants Iraq to use the Nabucco gas pipeline for gas exports to Europe. Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki attended the Nabucco agreement signing in 2009. In July 2009, Turkey and Iraq signed a memorandum of understanding to address bilateral water issues on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Despite claims of reduced water flow from Iraq, Turkey maintains its commitment to provide water to both countries. Joint measurement stations were established to monitor water levels, showing a cooperative effort to address the issue. In late September 2009, Turkey announced plans to open consulates in Mosul, Basra, and Irbil in the KRG territory. Despite past attacks, Turkey kept its embassy in Baghdad open. Turkish authorities aim for unity in Iraq by engaging with all ethnic groups and respecting their decisions. Turkey's relations with Iraq include addressing water issues on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers through joint efforts. Turkey has improved ties with Iran and Syria, consulting them regularly about Iraq. Allegations suggest Turkish military cooperation with Iran against Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. Turkish officials emphasize multilateral contact groups involving all of Iraq's neighbors. Public opinion towards the US has shifted positively since 2007, despite polls showing low approval rates. The United States has a low favorability rating of 14% in Turkey, largely due to U.S. policies towards Muslim-majority countries like Iraq. Turks lack confidence in Iraq's stability and may not decrease their anti-American sentiment. However, Turkey is willing to support the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq through its Incirlik Air Base and port of Mercin, as long as arms do not reach the PKK in northern Iraq. Saudi Arabia has a historically tense relationship with Iraq but has cooperated in the past, notably during the Iran-Iraq war. Saudi Arabia opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 but may have shared interests with the U.S. in certain situations. Saudi Arabia's interests in Iraq include preventing instability, protecting Sunni interests, limiting Iran's influence, and safeguarding its own security. The Saudi government has refrained from direct intervention in Iraq since 2003 but has focused on humanitarian aid and promoting reconciliation among Iraqis. Saudi Arabia aims to promote reconciliation in Iraq through regional conferences and prevent violence from spreading into its territory. Analysts suggest that Saudi Arabia may be supporting Sunni groups in Iraq due to concerns about the Shiite agenda of the Iraqi government. Despite official religious rulings against violent activities in Iraq, some Saudis still offer support to combatants. The phenomenon of Saudis fighting in Iraq alongside foreign fighters poses a long-term security challenge. Saudis traveling to Iraq to fight alongside foreign fighters poses a long-term security risk for both countries. Efforts to control exit visas have led to a decline in the number of Saudi fighters reaching Iraq. Estimates of the number of Saudis fighting in Iraq remain imprecise. U.S. military reports indicate that 12% of foreign fighters killed or captured in Iraq were Saudi nationals. Saudi officials are implementing a border security improvement program to prevent the return of Saudi volunteers from Iraq. They awarded a $2 billion contract to build a security system along the borders with Yemen and Iraq. Saudi Arabia is concerned about the empowerment of Iraq's Shiite Arab population and the growth of Iranian influence in the region. Saudi Foreign Minister expressed worries about U.S. policy handing Iraq over to Iran and warned of increased Sunni-Shiite violence. The tense relationship between Saudi Arabia's Sunni Arab majority and Shiite Arab minority adds to the complexity. The relationship between Saudi Arabia's Sunni Arab majority and Shiite Arab minority complicates efforts to engage with Iraq. Sunni Saudis view Shiites as potentially disloyal, leading to tensions and clashes. Despite efforts to increase cooperation with Iraq, slow progress and frustration persist. The Saudi government faces challenges in preventing sectarian incitement in Saudi Arabia. Efforts to improve relations with Iraq have been hindered by security concerns, delaying the opening of a Saudi embassy in Baghdad. As of September 2009, Saudi officials are hesitant to send high-level diplomatic personnel to Iraq due to security concerns. The bombing of Iraqi government ministries in August 2009 reinforced Saudi views of insecurity in Baghdad after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. Debt forgiveness is a key issue in Iraqi-Saudi relations, with Iraq owing $9 billion to Saudi Arabia from the Saddam Hussein era. U.S. officials are urging Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to forgive Iraq's debt to support reconstruction efforts. The Saudi government has pledged $500 million for Iraqi development projects. The Saudi government has pledged $500 million for Iraqi development projects and $90 million in humanitarian relief assistance. Trade between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been limited since 2003. Saudi Arabia refrains from overt interference in Iraq but there are reports of private Saudi support for anti-coalition and anti-Iraqi government activity. There are concerns that a return to sectarian violence in Iraq or assertive Iranian policy could undermine domestic support for Saudi Arabia's policy of restraint. In late 2006 through mid-2007, influential figures in Saudi Arabia called for direct political and security assistance to Iraq's Sunni Arab community. Since late 2006, influential figures in Saudi Arabia have called for political and security assistance to Iraq's Sunni Arab community to counter Iranian influence. Saudi clerics have forbidden Saudis from fighting in Iraq, but popular support for anti-U.S. or anti-Iranian activities may persist. Saudi officials have not fully embraced the current Iraqi government due to perceived sectarian policies and close ties with Iran. Reconciliation in Iraq could ease Saudi fears of instability but also pose new challenges. Saudi Arabia's main concern is dealing with returning Saudi militants. The reintegration or elimination of returning Saudi militants is a concern. The outcome of reconciliation or conflict in Iraq will impact Saudi fears of Shiite empowerment and Iranian influence. Future Iraqi choices in energy and military policy will affect Iraqi-Saudi relations. Syria and Iraq were rivals, but the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq disrupted their reconciliation efforts. Syria's opposition to the U.S. presence in Iraq hindered their ability to formulate a coherent Iraq policy. Once sectarian warfare peaked in 2006-2007, Syria re-engaged with Iraq. Between 2006 and 2007, sectarian warfare peaked, leading to 1.3 million Iraqi refugees flooding Syria. As Iraq stabilized between 2007 and 2009, Syria improved its ties with various Iraqi religious and sectarian groups. Syria, a Sunni Arab country with ties to Shiite Iran, played both sides of the Iraqi sectarian conflict. Relations between Syria and Iraq further improved in 2009 due to stronger U.S.-Syrian ties, leading to discussions on border security and the establishment of a tripartite committee to monitor the Syrian-Iraqi border. Syrian officials express willingness to cooperate with the Obama Administration on Iraq, citing a clear timetable for withdrawal as a Syrian demand. Despite old enmities, cooperation is sought to stabilize Iraq and facilitate the return of refugees. Diplomatic tensions arose in 2009 over bombings in Baghdad, with Syria denying responsibility. The Iraqi government responded to Syrian charges by broadcasting a confession of an Al Qaeda militant trained by Syrian intelligence. Both countries recalled their ambassadors amid tensions. Despite improved relations, the US asserts Syria harbors groups opposed to the Iraqi government. Syria needs to address border security and AQI activity hindering progress with Iraq. Despite decreased foreign fighter flow from Syria into Iraq, Syria remains the primary gateway for Iraq-bound foreign fighters. Speculations suggest that Syria may be harboring Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials to leverage negotiations with the US and Iraqi government. The Maliki government insists on Syria demonstrating greater resolve to limit the flow of foreign fighters and crack down on Al Qaeda in Iraq's Syrian network. Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari has raised concerns about unfriendly acts against the Iraqi government. Despite some Syrian cooperation, reports indicate ongoing activities by Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party members. Reports indicate that Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials operate inside Syria, funneling personnel, arms, and funds to fighters in Iraq. The U.S. Treasury has designated Syrian-based individuals for supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq. Syrian harboring of these elements has strained Syrian-Iraqi relations. Iraq condemned the U.S. strike in the Syrian Abu Kamal region, but acknowledged the Al Qaeda leader killed was wanted by Iraq. Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari emphasized the need for security coordination with Syria. The Syrian government demanded that the U.S.-Iraqi SOFA include provisions against raids from Iraq. After Al Qaeda bomb attacks in Iraq, Iraqi officials assured Syria their territory would not be used for raids into Syria. The Maliki government accused the Asad regime of hosting terrorist training camps and those responsible for attacks that killed about 100 people and injured hundreds more, leading to heated exchanges between Syrian and Iraqi leaders. This strained their diplomatic relationship despite recent breakthroughs in bilateral relations. Maliki presented evidence to Syrian authorities of Iraqi Baathists and Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives meeting in Syria. Relations between Iraq and Syria have deteriorated further following the August bombings. Iraq is demanding the extradition of two operatives believed to be in Syria. Iraq has also called for an international tribunal similar to the Hariri tribunal. Iraq sent extra police and soldiers to the Syrian border to prevent further infiltration. Iraq's Presidency Council objected to the prime minister's tough stance against Syria. The Iraqi refugee crisis has strained Syrian-Iraqi relations, with Syria hosting 1.3 million Iraqi refugees. This has led to economic challenges in Syria, including inflation, rising rents, and water shortages. The sex trade has also increased, with many Iraqi women working as prostitutes. Syrian authorities have imposed a visa requirement and are seeking more assistance from the Iraqi government and international community. The Maliki government has provided minimal assistance to Syrian refugees, with international aid organizations facing challenges due to Syria's bureaucratic rules. Despite some engagement on various issues, both countries have withdrawn their ambassadors over security disputes. Maliki visited Syria in 2007 to discuss security, commercial agreements, and the reopening of an oil pipeline. In 2009, U.S.-Syrian relations improved, focusing on potential cooperation. In April 2009, U.S.-Syrian relations warmed as Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Naji Otri visited Iraq to discuss border and energy cooperation. However, tensions over alleged Syrian support for terrorists have stalled progress. Plans to revive the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline for Iraqi oil exports through Syria have not materialized, with a Russian firm failing to start repairs. Syria and Iraq announced agreements to repair the pipeline in 2009, but no progress has been reported. Syria has developed ties with Iraqi Shiites, including ISCI and the Sadrists. President Asad has good relations with Kurdish leader Talabani. Syrian-Iraqi trade reached $6.6 billion in 2008. However, alleged Syrian support for Sunni insurgents and terrorists hinders relations. Syria's relationship with Iraq is hindered by alleged support for Sunni insurgents and terrorists, impacting bilateral cooperation and economic benefits. Jordan's ties with Iraq have been historically strong, with criticisms of Sunni Arab political marginalization since 2003. Jordan's limited ability to intervene in Iraq's affairs has led to concerns about Iraq's influence on Jordan's politics, trade, and internal security. The town of Zarqa has been identified as a source of Sunni militancy, with young men traveling to Iraq to join the insurgency. Despite the killing of Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2006, Jordan remains vigilant against transnational terrorism threats. The threat of Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists using Iraq's Al Anbar Province to destabilize Jordan remains a concern. In 2005, explosions in Amman killed 58 people, with Al Qaeda in Iraq claiming responsibility. Jordan thwarted a bomb attack at Queen Alia Airport in 2006. Jordan has a large population of Palestinian descent and faces refugee issues. The 400,000-500,000 Iraqis in Jordan have a difficult relationship with the government. The Iraqi influx is causing significant economic and social changes in Jordan. Inflation has risen, affecting middle-class Jordanians. Jordan has sealed its borders to prevent more Iraqis from entering, citing security concerns. The government classifies displaced Iraqis in Jordan as \"visitors\" or \"guests,\" not refugees. Some Iraqis can obtain residency by depositing $150,000 in Amman banks, while many others have become illegal aliens. In 2008, Jordan normalized relations with Iraq, appointing an ambassador and seeking benefits from the oil-rich neighbor. Jordan had relied on Iraq for oil before the U.S. invasion in 2003, but had to find alternative sources due to strained relations with the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. King Abdullah II visited Iraq in 2008, becoming the first Arab leader to do so since 2003. In August 2006, a tentative oil deal was reached between Jordan and Iraq, leading to Iraqi crude oil shipments arriving in Jordan in September 2008. Jordan was initially set to receive 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discounted price, with plans to increase to 30,000 barrels later on. Due to global oil price changes, the agreement was revised in 2008 to provide oil at $22 per barrel. Discussions about a pipeline from Iraq to Jordan were abandoned due to cost projections, with Jordan now seeking international financing for a railroad system to transport Iraqi oil to its refinery in Zarqa. In September 2009, Jordanian Prime Minister Nader Dahabi visited Iraq to discuss setting up a free trade zone to boost bilateral trade, which reached $1 billion in 2008. Talks also addressed Iraqi debts to Jordan, with the Iraqi central bank owing over $1 billion. Jordan faces threats from militant Islamist groups in Iraq, especially as U.S. forces withdraw. Jordan's intelligence services are strong, but there are concerns about foreign fighters leaving Iraq to target Jordan. Jordan's intelligence services and internal security forces are strong, facing threats from militant Islamist groups in Iraq. Government-to-government relations between Jordan and Iraq are expected to improve, with both sides needing to address issues such as Iraqi refugees, energy deals, border security, and their relationship with Iran. Jordan, like other Sunni Arab states, is wary of Iranian intentions in the region. Gulf leaders were hesitant to support U.S. military operations in Iraq, predicting that removing Saddam Hussein would not necessarily bring stability. The fall of Saddam Hussein initially relieved Gulf leaders of a conventional threat, but instability in Iraq and fears of an emboldened Iran created new concerns. Gulf states were cautious about supporting U.S. military action in Iraq, with Kuwait and Qatar being more openly supportive. The rise of Shiite factions in post-Saddam Iraq has led to residual threat perceptions among some Gulf leaders. Despite efforts to improve relations, Gulf Shiite communities feel under-represented in government and lack economic opportunities. In June 2008, the United Arab Emirates appointed an ambassador to Iraq and wrote off $7 billion in Iraqi debt. Bahrain also appointed an ambassador to Iraq. Gulf governments fear Iraq could become a safe haven for terrorists if security gains are reversed. Security discussions have been renewed between Gulf states and the United States. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki visited Washington, DC in July 2009 to discuss closing issues with the United Nations Security Council. Article 25 of the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement commits the United States to help Iraq return to its pre-invasion standing. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1859 reviews resolutions stemming from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Kuwait insists on unresolved issues, while Iraq wants a quick closure, especially regarding reparations costing $660 million in 2009. Iraq believes the reparations process is draining oil revenue that could be used for economic development. Kuwait seeks full compensation for the effects of the Saddam invasion, but some feel they should end the process for regional harmony. The United States, a close ally of Kuwait, has not openly supported Iraq's position. Kuwait's Amir visited the US in 2009, but official statements did not mention the Chapter VII issue, though it was likely discussed. Some argue Kuwait's government allows the Amir to shift blame for their stance. The Kuwaiti government may allow the emir to shift blame for their stance on an agreement with Iraq to the parliament, where opposition figures often delay objectionable measures. The complex interests of Iraq's neighbors and the United States pose challenges for U.S. policymakers. Congress and the Obama Administration continue to provide funding for Iraq's stabilization and economic reform, as well as support for Iraqi IDPs and refugees. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf region and its energy resources are crucial for strategic and economic reasons. The Gulf region's energy resources are crucial for the United States and its neighbors. Insurgency and violence in Iraq have posed security threats, but as they subside, the reintegration of Iraq into the region's security balance is a pressing issue. The U.S. military presence in the Middle East remains unpopular, and tensions with Iran over various issues persist. Insurgent and terrorist threats to energy infrastructure are significant security risks in the region. Terrorist threats to energy infrastructure in the region are a major security risk. Greater coordination between the United States and its allies is crucial to overcoming these challenges. Regional political rivalry and local developments may hinder effective responses to these threats. Success in containing terrorist elements in Iraq depends on Iraq's security forces and cooperation from regional governments. Concerns about instability in Iraq creating safe havens for terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the PKK persist. Success against Al Qaeda in Iraq has reduced these threats, but concerns about Kurdish militants and returning fighters from Iraq remain. The presence of Al Qaeda in Iraq is diminishing, but the potential for its resurgence exists in a destabilized environment. Tensions between Iraq and Syria highlight the risk of cross-border interference. Iran's growing influence in the Persian Gulf region is a concern for the US, exacerbated by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. Despite barriers like political divisions and ethnic differences, Iran's political influence in the region is expanding, causing apprehension among Israel and Sunni Arab-led governments. Israel and Sunni Arab-led governments share U.S. concerns about Iran's regional ambitions and nuclear program. Political sensitivities complicate cooperation on Iran. The Bush Administration prioritized political and economic reform in the Middle East. Reform efforts in some countries aim to address political dissatisfaction and limited economic prospects. Events in Iraq have influenced Islamist parties and opposition groups. Events in Iraq have encouraged Islamist parties, opposition groups, and minorities to push for greater representation and reform. Iraq's instability and political paralysis have tarnished the image of groups promoting change. Regional governments may prioritize short-term stability over long-term reforms in the event of renewed conflict. Successful transition in Iraq could lead to increased demands for participatory government. The 111th Congress will discuss proposals to strengthen Iraq's relationships with its neighbors, including diplomatic engagement and efforts to contain conflict effects. The United States engaged with Iraq's neighbors from 2003 to 2007 to address common concerns and facilitate Iraq's reintegration into the regional security balance and economy. Diplomatic efforts included international conferences and ministerial meetings, with Iraq now a member of the \"GCC plus three\" group. The \"GCC plus three\" group, consisting of Gulf Cooperation Council members plus Jordan and Egypt, met in New York in September 2009. U.S. engagement with Syria and Iran regarding Iraq has increased since 2007. Dialogue with Syria began in 2007, continued by the Obama Administration. The Bush Administration also held discussions with Iran on Iraq, with a working group meeting in Baghdad. Key questions remain on the level of support from Iraq's neighbors for Iraqi reconciliation and which Iraqis will cooperate with regional initiatives. Statements and commitments from regional conferences since 2003 have not been fully implemented. Despite regional conferences since 2003, agreements made by Iraqis and their neighbors have not been fully implemented. The U.S. may need to provide additional assistance to contain potential insurgency and conflict in Iraq, requiring new congressional authorization and appropriations. This could include increased military and counterterrorism assistance for Iraq or its neighbors, as well as border security cooperation. Efforts may include cooperation to target transnational groups like the PKK, modifying sanctions laws on Iran and Syria, restricting foreign fighters from Iraq, and providing emergency support for humanitarian operations."
