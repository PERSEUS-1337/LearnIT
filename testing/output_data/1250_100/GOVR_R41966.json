Uninsured children are less likely to have recommended medical visits and immunizations, relying more on costly emergency room care. A child's insurance status is influenced by parents' employer-sponsored coverage or public programs like Medicaid, which varies by state. In 2009, the health insurance status of children under age 19 was examined, including Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, and other coverage options. The report analyzes the relationship between the types of insurance held by children and their demographic characteristics and ties to the labor market. The report analyzes childhood uninsurance data from 2009 collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS) by the Census Bureau. The key variable is whether each child was uninsured in 2009, with statistical techniques used to adjust the data to represent all households in the nation. The March Supplement to the CPS is a widely used source to estimate levels of uninsurance in the United States. The report analyzes childhood uninsurance data from 2009, focusing on whether each child lacked health insurance at any point during the year. It examines the relationships between health insurance and demographic and employment characteristics of children and parents. Table 1 shows the insurance status of children based on their personal characteristics, revealing differences in insurance coverage by age, with younger children more likely to have public insurance and older children more likely to have employer-sponsored coverage. In 2009, uninsured rates varied among children based on race/ethnicity and region. Hispanic children had the highest uninsured rate (17.5%) and lowest employer-sponsored coverage (35.0%), while white children had the lowest uninsured rate (7.3%) and highest employer-sponsored coverage (69.4%). Black or Hispanic children were more likely to have public coverage than white or Asian children. Children in the Northwest or Midwest had lower uninsured rates (7.3% and 7.8%) compared to those in the South or West (13.0% and 11.0%). Employer-sponsored coverage was higher in the Northeast and Midwest (63%) than in the South and West (53%). Citizens were more likely to have employer-sponsored coverage than noncitizens, with native-born and naturalized children having similar rates (57.7% and 58.3%) compared to non-citizens (31.4%). In 2009, insurance coverage for children varied by family structure and income. Children in two-parent families had lower uninsured rates compared to those in single-parent households. Private health insurance coverage increased with family income, while public coverage decreased. Children's insurance source was linked to their parents' coverage, with those in families with employer-sponsored coverage more likely to have the same. In 2009, children's insurance coverage was linked to their parents' coverage. Children living with parents with employer-sponsored coverage or public coverage were more likely to have the same. Among children with uninsured parents, 41.2% were uninsured, while 52.8% had public coverage. Children with at least one parent working full-time had 71.2% with employer-sponsored insurance, while those with part-time parents had 31.6%. Public insurance filled gaps for those without employer-sponsored coverage. Employer-sponsored coverage rates varied based on the size of the firm, with higher rates for larger firms. It is crucial to choose an appropriate comparison group when evaluating uninsured children. Different data representations can lead to different conclusions. Figure 1 illustrates the percentage of uninsured children based on family structure. The percentage of uninsured children varies based on family structure, with two-parent families having the highest number of uninsured children. However, when comparing the percentage of uninsured children within each family structure, children in two-parent families are less likely to be uninsured than those in single-parent families. This paradox exists across different characteristics and data representations. The report examines trends in insurance and uninsurance among children under 19 from 1999 to 2009, including two economic recessions. Data from the CPS show that the percentage of uninsured children may fluctuate during a recession due to job losses. Policy makers need to consider these differences when proposing solutions to reduce the number of uninsured children. During a recession, job losses may lead to an increase in the uninsurance rate for children as parents may lose their employer-sponsored health insurance. However, a drop in parental income could make children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, potentially reducing the uninsurance rate. Legislative changes, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, can also impact insurance coverage during economic downturns. During economic recessions, job losses can affect children's insurance coverage, leading to an increase in the uninsurance rate. However, legislative changes like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 helped reduce the number of uninsured children. The uninsurance rate fluctuated between 1999 and 2009, with minimal impact from economic downturns on children's insurance status. The number of children covered by employer-sponsored insurance decreased from 65.2% in 1999 to 55.8% in 2009, leading to an increase in the uninsurance rate for children. On the other hand, the percentage of children covered by public health insurance (mainly Medicaid and CHIP) increased from 20.3% in 1999 to 33.8% in 2009, possibly due to factors like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act providing a temporary increase in federal Medicaid payments to states. Enrollment in CHIP increased throughout the decade, contributing to the rise in public coverage. Changes in parental take-up of public health insurance for children also played a role, with more children meeting eligibility criteria due to parental job loss. Between 1999 and 2009, the decrease in children covered by employer-sponsored insurance was offset by the increase in children covered by public health insurance, reducing the percentage of uninsured children."
