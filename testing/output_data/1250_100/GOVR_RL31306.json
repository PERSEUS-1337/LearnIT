    "content": "The omnibus appropriations resolution for FY2003 (H.J.Res. 2) was signed into law as P.L. 108-7 on February 20, 2003. It provided funding for Interior and related agencies, as well as 10 other regular appropriations bills not enacted for FY2003. The final FY2003 appropriation included $19.08 billion for the Interior and related agencies, along with $825.0 million to repay transferred amounts for fire fighting in FY2002. This bill also included a 0.65% across-the-board cut, with details on how it would be calculated for the Interior and related agencies remaining unclear. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations resolution (P.L. 108-7) provided funding for Interior and related agencies, including the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, Department of Energy, and Indian Health Service. President Bush's FY2003 budget request totaled $18.94 billion, a decrease from the $19.16 billion enacted for FY2002. The FY2003 budget request for agencies within DOI totaled $9.45 billion, with allocations for National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and other related agencies. President Bush's proposal to shift federal employee pensions and health benefits costs was not included in the budget totals. The FY2003 budget request for agencies within DOI totaled $9.45 billion. Increases and decreases in appropriations were proposed for various agencies, with some agencies seeing significant increases like the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs, while others faced decreases like the Forest Service and Department of Energy. Hearings on the FY2003 budget for Interior and related agencies began on February 27th, 2002. Interior Secretary Norton testified on various topics during hearings on the FY2003 budget for Interior and related agencies, including conservation initiatives, Indian trust funds, National Park Service maintenance backlog, Everglades restoration, energy programs, wildland fire management, and more. Members questioned proposed cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey and the transfer of its toxic substances program, as well as workforce restructuring and privatizing jobs. Subcommittee hearings continued from February through April 2002. On June 25, 2002, the House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee marked up and ordered actions. In June and July 2002, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up and reported their FY2003 funding recommendations for the Interior Department. The House passed H.R. 5093 on July 17, while the Senate bypassed subcommittee markup and reported S. 2708 on June 28. Interior Secretary Norton testified on security measures for national monuments, including funding for the National Park Service. The Senate debated the House funding bill for 10 days in September 2002 but did not pass an Interior funding bill in the 107th Congress due to controversies over wildfires. There were unsuccessful attempts to provide emergency funds for firefighting costs and forest thinning. The Senate also adopted a second degree amendment for farm disaster/drought relief. The Senate passed an Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY2003, including funding for Interior and related agencies. Controversies included farm disaster/drought relief, federal recognition of Indian tribes, stewardship contracting, development in various national forests, Everglades restoration, oil and gas leases, and management of Indian tribes' trust funds. Previous issues like funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and energy conservation programs were less controversial in this appropriation cycle. The Senate Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY2003 included funding for Interior and related agencies, totaling $19.80 billion. The bill also included across-the-board cuts and a rescission of 1.6%, with an additional reduction of 1.252% to offset $5 billion in education spending. This bill allocated more funding for DOI and related agencies for FY2003 compared to the Administration's proposal. The House bill for FY2003 has the highest total amount of $20.41 billion, including a $700 million fire supplemental. It provides higher funding for wildland fire fighting and various agencies compared to the Senate and Administration proposals. Conferees were appointed in January 2003, and the House and Senate agreed to the conference report on February 13, 2003. The Consolidated Appropriations resolution for FY2003, signed into law as P.L. 108-7, provided $19.08 billion for the Interior and related agencies, along with $825.0 million for fire fighting. A 0.65% cut was applied across accounts and programs. Appropriations for Interior and Related Agencies from FY1999 to FY2003 are shown in Table 2, excluding permanent budget authorities and reflecting rescissions. Interior and related agencies appropriations increased by 42% from FY1994 to FY2003, with most growth in the latter years. Funding rose by 33% from FY1999 to FY2003, with a significant increase from FY2000 to FY2001. The increase was mainly for land conservation and wildland fire management. Funding for anti-terrorism in FY2001 and FY2002 Interior appropriations is unclear. See Table 17 for FY2002-FY2003 Interior Appropriations comparison and Table 19 for budgetary history from FY1998 to FY2003. The annual appropriations laws and agency budgets include money for combating terrorism, such as the $3.0 million provided to the Bureau of Land Management in FY2002. Congress enacted a $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation for FY2001 in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, distributed in three phases. In response to the September 11th terrorist attacks, emergency supplemental funds were allocated through various acts, including P.L. 107-38 and P.L. 107-117. The Department of Interior and related agencies received $3.1 million for emergency response costs, with $1.7 million for the National Park Service and $1.4 million for the U.S. Park Police. Additionally, OMB submitted a $20 billion proposal for allocation, leading to the enactment of P.L. 107-117 with $88.1 million for anti-terrorism activities in FY2002. President Bush signed into law the FY2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act, which included $30 billion for anti-terrorism, defense, homeland security, and economic revitalization. $5.1 billion for contingent emergency spending was rejected by the President as it was deemed unrelated to a national emergency. President Bush submitted a $1 billion supplemental FY2003 request for selected programs, separate from the $5.1 billion rejected for FY2002. The FY2003 budget sought $37.7 billion for homeland security, with $25.2 billion for non-Department of Defense operations. Funding categories included first responders, bio-terrorism defense, border security, information sharing, technology use, and aviation security. The budget did not specify homeland security responsibilities for Interior and related agencies. In FY2003, additional funding of $88.8 million was allocated for combating terrorism, with $56.5 million for the National Park Service for security measures. The Office of the Secretary of the Interior received $5.6 million for law enforcement, and the Bureau of Reclamation received $26.7 million. The Department of Homeland Security was created on November 25, 2002, to coordinate federal anti-terrorism efforts. The Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 to coordinate anti-terrorism efforts, with funding allocated for various agencies including the National Park Service and Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau of Land Management manages public land for diverse uses such as minerals and energy development. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages public land for various uses including minerals development, energy development, livestock grazing, recreation, and preservation. They are also responsible for federal subsurface mineral resources and wildland fire management on millions of acres of land. Congress allocated $1.88 billion for BLM in FY2003, which is slightly higher than the previous year. Management of Lands and Resources received $825.7 million for FY2003, a 6% increase from FY2002. For the energy and minerals program in FY2003, Congress allocated $109.1 million, a 10% increase from FY2002. The additional funds were intended to increase oil and gas availability on federal lands, including Alaska North Slope development. The Administration sought funds to expedite permitting processes, increase lease sales, evaluate barriers to energy production, and enhance environmental inspections. Additional funds were added by the conferees for permitting in Nevada and drill permit applications. The FY2003 law retained Senate language on the renewal of the Trans-Alaska right of way. The FY2003 law retains Senate language on the renewal of the right of way for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, deeming the Final Environmental Impact Statement sufficient to meet requirements. It also includes provisions barring funds for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except as allowed by presidential proclamations. Additionally, language regarding the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year Supply Program was dropped from the bill. The FY2003 law includes provisions barring funds for energy leasing activities within national monuments, with opponents arguing it could hinder energy resource development. The House Committee on Appropriations also included language in the bill to prevent potential energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill includes provisions on energy leasing activities within national monuments and potential energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The bill allows for automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases until the renewal process is completed under applicable laws and regulations. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill includes provisions on energy leasing activities within national monuments and potential energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also addresses automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases to address heavy agency workloads. Congress allocated $47.6 million for land use planning, a 44% increase from the previous year, to initiate new plans and update existing ones to address current issues like energy development and wildfire protection. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill includes provisions for updating land use plans, with a focus on wildland fire management. Congress allocated funds for fire fighting on Interior Department lands and the Forest Service. The National Fire Plan emphasizes reducing hazardous fuels. Conferees disagreed with using 70% of hazardous fuels funds in the wildland urban interface, citing existing collaboration with communities. Additionally, $189.0 million was allocated to repay amounts transferred for firefighting during FY2002. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill includes provisions for updating land use plans, with a focus on wildland fire management. Congress allocated funds for fire fighting on Interior Department lands and the Forest Service. For the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT), Congress enacted $220.0 million, an increase over FY2002. The Land Acquisition budget for FY2003 is $33.5 million, a 33% reduction from FY2002, with funds appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The BLM aims to prioritize alternatives to fee title land purchases. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill includes provisions for updating land use plans, focusing on wildland fire management. Congress allocated funds for fire fighting on Interior Department lands and the Forest Service. For the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT), Congress enacted $220.0 million, an increase over FY2002. The Land Acquisition budget for FY2003 is $33.5 million, a 33% reduction from FY2002, with funds appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The BLM aims to prioritize alternatives to fee title land purchases. (For more information, see the \"LandAcquisition\" section below.) Appropriations for BLM, FY2002-FY2003 are detailed in Table 3. The Administration requested $1.28 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for FY2003, a slight increase over FY2002. Further information on the Bureau of Land Management can be found on its World Wide Web site. The FY2003 appropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) totaled $1.25 billion, with the largest portion allocated to the Resources Management account. Endangered Species program funding saw an increase to $131.5 million, up from $125.7 million in FY2002. The FY2003 appropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service totaled $1.25 billion, with the largest portion allocated to the Resources Management account. Endangered Species program funding increased to $131.5 million, up from $125.7 million in FY2002. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $132.6 million for conservation programs benefiting species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Landowner Incentive Program increased to $50 million, while Stewardship Grants remained at $10 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations was critical of the funding allocation for these programs. Overall, FY2003 enacted funding for the Endangered Species program and related programs would decrease by $58.4 million (21.5%) from FY2002. The FY2003 law addresses a dispute over the management of the Missouri River and its impact on listed species, urging parties to reach an agreement on a flow schedule. Controversial Corps of Engineers proposals to modify the river's flow regime are noted, with potential harm to listed species. The provision does not insulate Corps activities from citizen suits under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and some environmental groups have indicated their intention to sue the Corps under ESA for its management of Missouri River flows. The National Wildlife Refuge System is set to celebrate its centennial in 2003 with various planned activities and renovations. Funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System in FY2003 saw an overall increase, with the President proposing a 7.6% increase for operations and maintenance. The President proposed a 7.6% increase for the National Wildlife Refuge System, but the enacted bill provided a 25.8% increase. The Administration recommended $52.0 million for NWRS infrastructure improvements, which was supported by the House. The FY2003 appropriations law did not specify funding for this program and continued a prohibition on expenditures for new units without approval. Interest in energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is high, with proposed increased allocation for ANWR management. No specific earmarks were provided for ANWR or any other specific refuge in the Senate Committee report. The conference agreement maintained the House allocation for the National Wildlife Refuge System but removed a restriction in the BLM budget related to potential development in ANWR. The FY2003 Budget Justification highlighted the increased security measures at refuge facilities post-9/11 attacks, with refuge officers being deployed nationwide to support national security efforts. Refuge officers have responsibilities along coastal areas, borders, and urban areas, with Cabeza Prieta Refuge being located along the Mexican border. The President proposed $49.9 million for Law Enforcement and $2.0 million for infrastructure improvement in several refuges along U.S. coasts, including Cabeza Prieta near the Mexican border. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $51.9 million for Law Enforcement with no set-aside for infrastructure. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands, with Congress making up the difference in annual appropriations. The Administration requested $14.4 million for FY2003 for the Fund, covering 55% of the authorized full payment. Land Acquisition was also addressed in the FY2003 budget. For FY2003, the Administration proposed $70.4 million for Land Acquisition, a 29.0% decrease from the previous year. The appropriations law provided $73.4 million, with 76.1% allocated to specified refuges. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) benefits various endangered species and received $5.0 million in funding for FY2003. Congress rejected a proposed transfer of funds from the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund to the MSCF and appropriated $3.0 million for the Migratory Bird program. The funding for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund and Migratory Bird Fund increased over the President's request for FY2002-2003. The Neotropical Migratory Bird program also received increased funding. The program was first authorized in FY2002 and is not part of the MSCF. The FY2003 request of $1 million is included in the FY2003 column total only for the Request column. For more information on the Fish and Wildlife Service, visit their website at http://www.fws.gov/. The National Park Service (NPS) manages a park system covering 84 million acres with diverse units. They also provide funding support to national heritage areas. In 2002, an estimated 276 million people visited park units. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $2.25 billion for the NPS, a decrease from the previous year. The President aimed to eliminate the maintenance backlog and enhance security at NPS sites. The Senate and House approved budgets for the National Park Service, with the Senate approving $2.29 billion and the House approving $2.40 billion. The park operations budget covers resource protection, visitor services, facility maintenance, and park support programs. An environmental coalition and Members of Congress sought a $280 million increase in the NPS operating budget for various programs and infrastructure repair. The Senate agreed to continue efforts to increase funding for NPS operations. Congress should continue efforts to increase funding for operations of the National Park Service and seek to eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog by FY2007. The President's request included funds for a proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative (CCI) which would provide matching funds for park projects. The Senate rejected the proposed CCI, citing existing unmet needs. The House supported conservation partnerships but did not specify funding for the CCI. Congress did not fund the Initiative, but retained $5 million for the NPS Challenge Cost Share Program in FY2003. The Administration requested $322.4 million for park facilities in FY2003, a decrease of $65.3 million from FY2002. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $327.8 million, $5.4 million above the request. An additional $529.4 million was requested for facility operation and maintenance, but the law only provided $522.8 million. The total request for construction and maintenance was $851.8 million, a decrease from FY2002. The estimated deferred maintenance backlog for the National Park Service is between $4.1 billion to $6.8 billion. The NPS has a deferred maintenance backlog of $4.1 billion to $6.8 billion. President Bush aimed to eliminate this backlog within five years using new appropriations, transportation funds, and recreation fees. The FY2003 budget allocated $78.4 million for the United States Park Police, an increase from FY2002 but a decrease from the total FY2002 appropriation. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for increased security post-9/11 attacks, with emphasis on anti-terrorism protection at national icon sites. Funding for National Recreation and Preservation programs was reduced in FY2003 but partially restored in the appropriations law. The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program did not receive funds in FY2003, except for administration costs of previously awarded grants. In FY2003, Congress provided $30.0 million for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program, with $300,000 allocated for administrative expenses. For NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance, $172.5 million was allocated, including $74.5 million for federal land acquisition and $98.0 million for state assistance, a reduction from previous years. The Administration had requested $86.1 million for federal land acquisition, a decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The Administration's FY2003 budget requested $200 million for Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state assistance, including $50 million for grants under the Cooperative Conservation Initiative and $150 million for traditional LWCF state grants. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (Fee Demo) allows federal land management agencies to retain and spend entrance and user fees for projects, with at least half of the receipts used for deferred maintenance. The program was started in FY1996 and the Administration intended to propose legislation to make it permanent. The agencies collaborated on developing a permanent program for fee program permanence, but no bills were enacted in the 107th Congress. Citizens objected to paying fees for previously free recreation in national forests. The Everglades Restoration project, including the Modified Water Delivery Project, is controversial due to land acquisition issues. The Corps asserts authority to acquire land from unwilling sellers through condemnation. The FY2003 law authorizes the U.S Army Corps of Engineers to implement a flood protection plan for the \"8.5 Square Mile Area\" as part of the Modified Waters Delivery Project. The Corps can acquire residential property in the area if owners are offered comparable property with flood protection. Financial assistance is provided for land acquisitions, funded by the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 and the Department of the Interior. The Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 and funds from the DOI are used for land acquisition to restore the Everglades. The Modified Water Delivery Project and parts of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan rely on acquiring this land. Legislation requires completion of the Modified Water Delivery Project before certain Everglades restoration projects can proceed. Authorization for the controversial Alternative 6D Plan was removed from the House version of the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill, but the Senate passed an omnibus bill including an amendment for the Corps to implement flood protection under Alternative 6D for the 8.5 Square Mile Area. The Historic Preservation Fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants for the protection and restoration of historic sites and cultural resources. Funding is typically on a 60% federal-40% state matching share basis, with additional support for cultural heritage projects for Native American tribes and other indigenous groups. The Historic Preservation Fund, reauthorized through FY2005, received $69.0 million in FY2003, an increase from the previous year. Save America's Treasures grants are now funded alongside the Historic Preservation Fund to preserve significant cultural artifacts and historic structures. Save America's Treasures program funds restoration of historic sites and artifacts, including the Star Spangled Banner, Rosa Parks Museum, and Mark Twain House. Projects require a 50% cost share and no single project can receive more than one grant. FY2003 appropriations for the program are $30.0 million. Funds from P.L. 104-333 were allocated for preservation projects on HBCU campuses, with grants awarded for repairs on historic buildings. However, funding for HBCUs under HPF was eliminated in FY2003 due to expended authorized funding. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which received federal funding, no longer has permanent federal funding since FY1998. The National Trust for Historic Preservation lost permanent federal funding in FY1998. However, a one-time appropriation in FY2002 was provided for the endangered properties endowment. Financial assistance programs include the Preservation Services Fund and the National Preservation Loan Fund. Funding for the Historic Sites Fund endowment was reduced to $2.0 million in FY2003. The final appropriation provides $2.0 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, which includes funding for the endowment. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the primary science agency for earth and biological science information, natural hazards, and water resources. The USGS will receive $925.3 million for various programs in FY2003, $11.3 million over FY2002. The National Mapping Program was allocated $134.1 million, $4.8 million above the Administration's request. The committee is interested in the development of the National Map for urban areas. The National Map is a compilation of digital and topographic maps covering the entire country, providing up-to-date information for emergency responses. The House approved $135.1 million for the National Mapping Program in FY2003, emphasizing the importance of completing and implementing the map. The Senate passed $131.1 million for the program. For Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes, FY2003 funding is $234.7 million, $10.0 million above the Administration's request and $1.9 million above FY2002 levels. Funding for various programs in FY2003 is $925.3 million, $11.3 million over FY2002. For FY2003, funding for various programs increased slightly compared to FY2002 levels. Hazards Assessments, Landscape and Coastal Assessments, and Resource Assessments received $75.4 million, $79.2 million, and $80.0 million, respectively. Funding for specific programs like volcanic equipment in Shemya, Alaska and a coastal erosion study in North Carolina was maintained or increased. The House approved $234.7 million for FY2003 appropriations, with increases for the National Coastal Program, research on global dust events, oil and gas resource assessments, and geothermal efforts. The Senate approved $234.9 million for the FY2003 program, $10.2 million above the request. Funding for Water Resources and Investigations was $208.5 million, $30.7 million above the request. The Senate disagreed with many program reductions and restored funding for programs like NAWQA and the Toxic Substances Hydrology Program. The FY2003 funding for Water Resources Research Institutes was kept at $6.0 million, with increases for Hydrologic Research and Development to $15.5 million. Additional funding included $1 million for the Long-term Estuary Assistance Program and $0.5 million for the Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin. The Rathdrum Prairie/Spokane Valley aquifer study was not funded, but may be considered next year. The House approved $209.7 million for Water Resources and Investigations for FY2003. The Senate approved $206.6 million for water resources investigations in FY2003, exceeding the request by $28.8 million. Funding was restored for various programs including the National Water Quality Assessment Program and Biological Research activities received $170.9 million, $10.4 million more than requested. The National Biological Information Infrastructure program faced criticism for lack of direction and budget accountability. The NBII program aims to increase access to biological data. The USGS was tasked with creating a plan for the program's vision, national and international activities, and how it aligns with USGS goals. The House approved $170.4 million for Biological Research in FY2003, while the Senate approved $166.9 million. Science Support Funding focuses on modernizing scientific information infrastructure. The FY2003 appropriation for Science Support was $85.7 million, slightly below the Administration's request and FY2002 levels. Facilities Funding received $91.4 million, exceeding the Administration's request and FY2002 levels. The House and Senate had differing approved amounts for both Science Support and Facilities. The USGS expressed strong support for partnerships emphasizing collaboration. The Minerals Management Service administers offshore mineral programs, collecting billions in revenues from federal leases. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The offshore leases are allocated among coastal states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $171.4 million for MMS, including $6.1 million for oil spill research. The total budget for MMS for FY2003 was $270.6 million, with $264.4 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. The Senate supported a total of $270.7 million for MMS. Offset collections would decline by $2.5 million from FY2002 to FY2003. The MMS budget for FY2003 was $270.7 million, with $137.6 million for OMM and $83.3 million for MRM programs. Revenue estimates were revised downward by 40% due to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas. Royalties from natural gas production have historically accounted for 40%-45% of MMS receipts. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a 5-year leasing program specifying lease sales. The new 5-year program (2002-2007) includes 20 oil and gas lease sales, with controversy surrounding sales in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. The FY2003 appropriations law continues the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico outside Lease Sale 181. Additionally, a breach-of-contract lawsuit involving MMS and nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion drew congressional interest. A breach-of-contract lawsuit was filed by nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for undeveloped leases. The companies claim that MMS failed to conduct consistency determinations required by the court. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 was amended in 1990 to allow for consistency determinations. In 1999, MMS extended 36 out of 40 leases by granting suspensions, but the Ninth Circuit Court struck down the suspensions in 2001. The Bush Administration appealed the decision, proposing a more limited lease development plan involving 20 leases using existing platforms. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision in December 2002. The Department of the Interior has 90 days to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court regarding leases that are in effect pending the appeal. Legislation has been proposed to prohibit funding for exploration and development of the contested leases, with efforts to compensate companies for surrendering undeveloped leases off California's coast. The Administration plans to buy back oil and gas leases from Chevron, Conoco, and Murphy oil companies off Pensacola, Florida for $115 million. This includes lease buybacks in various national parks that require approval from Congress. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ensures coal-mined land is restored, funded by the Abandoned Mine Lands fund. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement oversees state regulatory programs for coal mining, with funding decreasing in FY2003. The budget includes Regulation and Technology programs, as well as Abandoned Mine Lands funding. The Administration requested $279.4 million, with the Senate passing $297.1 million for FY2003. For FY2003, the Administration sought $174.0 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund, a reduction of $29.4 million from the previous year. Congress enacted $105.4 million for Regulation and Technology, and $191.7 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands program, with the Senate recommending more funding to restore cuts made by the Administration. The Senate Committee approved $17.5 million for AML grants and $210,000 for high priority reclamation projects. They also agreed to $10 million for ACSI and $1.5 million for SOAP. The FY2003 appropriations law enacted these levels, with grants to states based on coal production. \"Minimum program states\" with AML issues but low coal production receive $2 million, despite objections, since FY1996. Some states are advocating for increased AML appropriations. The unappropriated balance in the AML fund is expected to be $1.65 billion by the end of FY2003. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. Programs include government operations, education, economic development, and more. The FY2003 budget for BIA was $2.27 billion, a 1.2% increase from the previous year. The FY2003 budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was $2.27 billion, a 1.2% increase from the previous year. The Administration requested a total BIA-wide increase of $34.8 million for trust management improvement, but the FY2003 appropriations law reduced it to $31.9 million. The Branch of Acknowledgment and Research (BAR) received additional funding, with the House enacting $1.6 million for tribal recognition activities. The House Appropriations Committee dropped a provision for a study commission on Native American policy from the FY2003 Interior bill. A proposed Senate floor amendment for a moratorium on BAR tribal recognition approvals was tabled. The Senate added a new title to enact a settlement of an Indian land claim by Sandia Pueblo of New Mexico in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill. Key issues for the BIA include reorganization of trust asset management functions, tribal influence on BIA programs, and problems in the BIA school system. The BIA historically managed Indian tribes' trust funds and assets, including land and economic resources. However, mismanagement led to reforms in 1994 and 1996, creating the OST for oversight. The BIA still manages trust assets, while the OST focuses on fund management. The Secretary of the Interior's trust management improvement project involves various offices and systems enhancements. The trust management improvement project involves enhancements in trust asset systems, policies, and procedures, including historical accounting and backlog reduction. A new computerized trust asset management system faced criticism, leading to a review by Electronic Data Systems, Inc. (EDS) and a recommendation for a single executive overseeing trust reform. The Secretary proposed splitting off BIA's trust asset management responsibilities into a new Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management (BITAM) in 2001. The Secretary did not approve the reprogramming request and consulted with Indian tribes in 2002. Many tribes opposed the BITAM proposal and offered alternative plans. The Senate Appropriations Committee forbade implementing the BITAM proposal in FY2003. In December 2002, a new proposed reorganization of BIA and OST trust management structures was announced. The Secretary announced a new proposed reorganization of BIA and OST trust management structures, aiming for greater tribal control over federal Indian programs through various forms of tribal contracting, compacting, and Tribal Priority Allocations. The BIA funds schools and dormitories for 48,000 students in 23 states, with appropriations for contract support costs meeting 88-91% of tribal needs in FY2001-2002 and estimated to meet 92% in FY2003. The BIA operates over 2,000 structures educating 48,000 students in 23 states. Key problems include low student achievement and inadequate school facilities. The Administration proposed a School Privatization Initiative to improve academic performance, but it faced opposition from Indian tribes and organizations. Funding for the initiative was not included in the FY2003 appropriations law. Many BIA school facilities are old and dilapidated with health and safety deficiencies. The BIA operates over 2,000 structures educating 48,000 students in 23 states. BIA education construction covers construction of new school facilities and repair of existing facilities. In 2001, the BIA estimated a $942 million backlog in education facility repairs. FY2002 education construction appropriations are shown in Table 10.

The NIGC, established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, oversees tribal bingo and Class II operations. Its budget comes from fees assessed on tribes. In 1998, the budget ceiling was increased to $8 million, and Class III operations were also subject to fees. The NIGC faced increased demand for oversight due to the expansion of California Indian gaming. Funding for NIGC activities from FY1999-FY2002 came from fees, with no direct appropriations. The NIGC's budget for FY2003 included proposed appropriations of $2 million and fee receipts of $8 million. Congress did not enact NIGC appropriations for that year, but the fee ceiling was increased to $12 million for FY2004. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and funds. In 1996, trust fund management was transferred from the BIA to the OST due to inadequate management highlighted in federal, tribal, and congressional reports. The FY2002 funding for the Office of Special Trustee was $110.2 million, with $99.2 million allocated for federal trust programs and $11.0 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Administration proposed a FY2003 budget of $159.0 million for the OST, with $151.0 million for federal trust programs and $8.0 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Senate approved an increase to $162.0 million for the OST in FY2003. The Senate approved an increase for the OST to $162.0 million, 47% over FY2002, including $3 million for the Indian land consolidation project. The House approved $149.3 million for FY2003, with $141.3 million for trust programs and $8.0 million for land consolidation. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds and Individual Indian Money accounts, totaling about $3.5 billion. The trust funds controversy involves a class action lawsuit filed in 1996 against the federal government by IIM account holders. The latest stage of the lawsuit relates to an historical accounting for IIM funds to determine the amount owed to the plaintiffs. DOI was directed to develop a sampling methodology for IIM accounting, with a cost-benefit analysis required before implementation. The plaintiffs estimate they are owed about $137 billion using a different methodology. The court held the Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs in contempt for ongoing issues in trust management reform. While not appointing a receiver, both parties were directed to submit plans for future trust management and accounting. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to the FY2003 Interior appropriations act, including limiting the historical accounting period and capping officials' compensation. The full House agreed to most provisions except the time limit for historical accounting. The Senate did not agree to any provisions. The FY2003 appropriations law included provisions from the House Appropriations Committee, but the Senate did not agree to any. The Office of Insular Affairs provides financial assistance to territories and former insular areas, with funding consisting of permanent appropriations and discretionary funding. The approved funding level for FY2003 is $349.6 million. The Office of Insular Affairs budget for FY2003 includes $252.4 million in permanent appropriations, with $146.4 million going to three freely associated states and $106.0 million to U.S. territories. Discretionary funding makes up the remaining balance, with the Bush Administration seeking to reduce it to $91.0 million, but the appropriations law allocated $97.2 million. Funding for Insular Affairs in FY2003 includes $76.2 million for Assistance to Territories and $21.0 million for Compact of Free Association. Congress monitors economic development in insular areas. The Forest Service budget for FY2003 is $3.98 billion, $153.7 million less than FY2002. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill allocated funding for forest fires and forest health, with debates focusing on fire funding, wildfire protection programs, and fuel reduction activities. The National Fire Plan received increased attention due to severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002. The severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002 led to debates and proposals for fire control and protection. The National Fire Plan was introduced in response, with significant funding allocated for wildfire operations, fuel reduction, and restoration. Total appropriations for the plan in FY2001 were $2.89 billion, and in FY2002, it was funded at $2.24 billion. The National Fire Plan was funded at $2.24 billion in FY2003, with the Bush Administration proposing $2.02 billion initially. The enacted appropriation was $2.03 billion, slightly more than requested but less than the FY2002 level. The funding included $160.4 million for BLM and $420.7 million for FS fire suppression. In FY2003, there was a decrease in funding for fire suppression for both BLM and FS compared to FY2002 levels. The appropriation for BLM fire preparedness matched the President's request, while FS fire preparedness saw a decrease. Other BLM fire operations received a reduced appropriation, while other FS fire operations saw a slight increase. The 2002 fire season was severe, with wildfires threatening various states. In November 2002, wildfires burned 7,112,733 acres in Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, and other states. Congress debated providing $825 million in supplemental funds for FY2002 firefighting efforts, with $636 million for FS and $189 million for BLM. The House initially added $700 million for fire suppression, while the Administration later requested $825 million to supplement firefighting efforts. During Senate consideration of H.R. 5093 in FY2002, Sen. Byrd proposed an amendment to add the Administration's request to the Interior bill. A draft substitute by Sen. Domenici sought $1.25 billion for firefighting efforts, but was not offered. Sen. Craig later proposed an amendment to allow wildfire fuel reduction projects with less environmental review. The Senate debated these amendments from September 5 to September 25 without resolution, leading to the discontinuation of debate on the Interior appropriations bill in the 107th Congress. The House Resources Committee continued to consider related legislation, but none was enacted. The FY2003 appropriations law extended stewardship contracting authorization for BLM and FS through 2013, allowing fuel reduction activities in timber sale contracts. Congress also reviewed funding for other Forest Service programs, including the Economic Action Program, which received $26.4 million in FY2003 appropriations. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $31.4 million for the Economic Action Program (EAP), with an additional $5.0 million for EAP in the Wildfire Management account. This total is $26.2 million below the FY2002 appropriations. The Administration proposed a 13% cut in land acquisition, reducing it to $130.5 million. The FY2003 enacted level for land acquisition was $133.8 million, $15.9 million less than FY2002. Infrastructure Improvement funding was reduced by $10.1 million to $45.9 million, with $4.9 million shifted to other capital improvements. Additionally, a new Emerging Pest and Pathogens Fund was proposed at $12.0 million to address invasive species issues. The Senate included $14.0 million for a Fund, while the House did not allocate any funds for it in FY2003. Another proposed program was $15.0 million for Expedited Consultations, but it did not receive funding in the FY2003 appropriations law. The Forest Stewardship Program saw a decrease in funding to $32.2 million, while the Forest Legacy Program was reduced to $60.0 million by the House and increased to $74.0 million by the Senate. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $68.8 million for the Tongass National Forest, $1.0 million less than requested but $3.8 million more than FY2002 appropriations. Congress approved no additional wilderness in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, prohibiting appeals and judicial review. For more information on the U.S. Forest Service, visit http://www.fs.fed.us/. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated funding for various forest-related programs, including $624.9 million for Fossil Energy R&D, representing a 7% increase over FY2002 and a 28% increase over the President's FY2003 request. For more information on the Department of Energy, visit http://www.energy.gov/. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated funding for fossil energy programs, including the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) and Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) deferrals. The Senate approved $625.7 million, while the House approved $664.2 million. Up to $15.0 million in prior year funds may be used for CCTP administration in FY2003. The CCPI aims to enhance the reliability and environmental performance of coal-fired power generators. The Administration requested $150.0 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) for FY2003, part of a $2 billion ten-year commitment. The Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) has faced rescissions and deferrals since the mid-1990s. The Senate and House supported the CCPI funding but differed on deferrals for the CCTP. The CCTP will eventually be phased out. The Senate and House disagreed on funding for the FY2003 Fossil Energy program. The Administration proposed cuts to natural gas and petroleum R&D, but the Senate and House supported higher funding levels. The Fuels program faced potential elimination in the Administration's request, but the Senate and House allocated funds for it. The Energy Technology Center received $68.9 million in the FY2003 appropriations law, higher than the Administration's request. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $64.9 million for the Energy Technology Center programs, with the Senate and House supporting $69.9 million and $67.9 million respectively. Additionally, $40.2 million was provided for sequestration R&D, an increase from the previous year but a decrease from the Administration's request. The Fossil Energy Infrastructure program was retained within Fossil Energy with an appropriation of $9.1 million. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to store over 570 million barrels of crude oil in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use. Calls for drawdowns from the SPR were made in 1999 due to oil price increases. The Clinton Administration authorized exchanges and swaps of oil from the SPR, as well as accepting 28 million barrels as royalty-in-kind payments. President Bush ordered the SPR to be filled to capacity in 2001 using royalty-in-kind oil. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was filled to capacity with 700 million barrels of RIK oil starting in the spring of 2002. The FY2003 appropriation law allocated $180.9 million for the SPR, including funds for facilities, operations, transportation of RIK oil, and the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve. The budget request for FY2003 was $187.7 million, with allocations for storage facilities, management of SPR sites, and transportation of RIK oil. The FY2003 appropriation law allocated funds for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR). The Senate recommended $189.9 million, while the House approved $190.9 million. The omnibus appropriations legislation approved by the Senate included $172.9 million for the SPR and $6 million for the NHOR. President Bush's previous expression that the SPR should be filled to capacity was affirmed. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) should be filled to capacity as soon as practicable, as affirmed by President Bush. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the oil field at Elk Hills, CA. On January 14, 2000, the undeveloped Naval Oil Shale Reserve-2 was returned to the Ute Indian Tribe. The Naval Petroleum Reserves program includes two small oil fields in California and Wyoming, generating an estimated revenue of $7.2 million in FY2003. The FY2003 budget request for the Naval Petroleum Reserves was $20.8 million, with a $3 million reduction from the approved levels. A settlement between California and the federal government over Elk Hills resulted in the California Teachers' Retirement Fund receiving 9% of the sale proceeds. The FY2003 budget request included an advance appropriation of $36.0 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund, enacted in the FY2003 appropriations law. The Energy Efficiency Program aims to terminate projects with insufficient public benefit and expand programs for increased benefits. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/reserves/npr. The DOE proposed to decrease conservation funding under DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy from $912.8 million in FY2002 to $901.6 million in FY2003. In the 107th Congress, the House-approved level for the DOE Energy Conservation Program would have increased funding by $71.9 million, or 8%, compared to FY2002. The House level included funding for weatherization grants, state energy grants, R&D, and a general reduction. In the 108th Congress, the Senate-passed bill contained $884.3 million for the FY2003 DOE Energy Conservation Program, $37.4 million less than recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee in the 107th. The Senate-approved bill for the FY2003 DOE Energy Conservation Program was $897.6 million, which was $24.1 million lower than the House-approved level in the 107th Congress. This included cuts in R&D and grants, with a slight reduction compared to the Administration's request. The enacted level also saw cuts in transportation R&D, industry R&D, and increases in Power Technologies. In the FY2003 DOE Energy Conservation Program, Power Technologies funding increases by $6.8 million, while Buildings Research and Standards decreases by $2.6 million. Energy Star sees a $1.2 million increase. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.0 million for program reviews by the National Academy of Sciences. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed EERE to revise budget request documents for FY2004. For more information, visit http://www.mbe.doe.gov/budget/03budget/ and http://www.eren.doe.gov/. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides comprehensive medical and environmental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban Indian operated programs and facilities. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, and health stations to serve over 1.5 million to 1.7 million AI/AN individuals from federally recognized tribes in 34 states. Tribes and tribal groups also operate health facilities under IHS contracts. For more information, visit http://www.dhhs.gov/. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates numerous healthcare facilities, including hospitals, health centers, and health stations, serving over 1.5 to 1.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. IHS funding is divided into services and facilities categories, with appropriations for FY2003 totaling $2.868 billion, primarily allocated to health services. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives funding from various sources including private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The service budget includes clinical services, preventive health services, and other services. For FY2003, the House provided $1.996 billion, the Senate recommended $1.949 billion, and Congress enacted $1.987 billion. Enacted appropriations will support programs for hospitals, clinics, dental health, mental health, substance abuse treatment, and contract health care. In FY2003, the House appropriated $483.1 million for contract health care, 4.9% over FY2002, and $15 million more than the Senate recommendation. Congress enacted $478.1 million for contract health services, which are purchased when IHS cannot provide medical care. For preventive health services, both the House and Senate recommended $103.3 million, with Congress providing the requested amount. Funding was also allocated for public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and the community health representatives' program. Other health-related activities received $402.1 million in funding. In FY2003, the House appropriated $483.1 million for contract health care, exceeding the Senate recommendation. Congress enacted $478.1 million for contract health services. For preventive health services, both the House and Senate recommended $103.3 million, with Congress providing the requested amount. Funding was also allocated for public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and the community health representatives' program. Additionally, the House, Senate, and Congress allocated funds for off-reservation urban health projects and tribal management grants. The House and Senate differed in amounts for scholarships to Indian health professionals, with Congress enacting the Senate amount. The House also expected IHS to implement a program offering bonus payments to health professionals. In FY2003, Congress enacted $478.1 million for contract health services, with funding allocated for preventive health services, public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and community health representatives' program. Both the Senate and House proposed $270.7 million for contract support costs, which was enacted. The Senate expressed concern about the Administration's proposal to transfer IHS's Office of Legislative Affairs to DHHS. The Committee did not agree to the consolidation of the IHS office under DHHS, as it handles complex Native American and Alaskan Indian health service issues. The House recommended $391.9 million for FY2003 for IHS facilities, while the Senate provided $365.4 million. Congress enacted $376.2 million, which was above the FY2002 amount. The House and Senate disagreed with several changes in the President's budget for IHS. The House and Senate disagreed with changes in the President's budget regarding IHS funds for sanitation facilities in new houses funded by HUD. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301, resolving a land dispute between the tribes. Most relocatees are Navajo families who have already relocated under the Act. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is involved in housing and land acquisition for families relocating under the Act. Approximately 233 families, mostly Navajo, still need to complete relocation, with some refusing to move. ONHIR received $15.1 million in FY2002 and $14.5 million in FY2003 for their activities. Negotiations and litigation have taken place among the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, and federal government regarding various issues, including Hopi Tribe claims against the United States. In 1995, a proposed settlement agreement was reached between the United States and the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved a settlement agreement between the United States and the Hopi Tribe, including 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. Despite some opposition, most Navajo families signed accommodation agreements by September 1999. The Hopi Tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases, but legislation prevents forced relocation without providing replacement homes. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved a settlement agreement between the United States and the Hopi Tribe, including 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. The ONHIR has a backlog of relocatees approved for replacement homes. The settlement allows the Hopi Tribe to take action against the United States if Navajo families have not relocated or entered into agreements. The federal government's role in supporting arts and culture is a perennial issue addressed by Congress. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum complex with 16 museums, the National Zoo, and research facilities. It receives 70% federal funding and was established in 1846. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $548.5 million for the Smithsonian. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $449.1 million for the Smithsonian's Salaries and Expenses, $16.0 million for the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) construction. The NMAI faced controversy over the need for a new museum in Washington. Donations totaling $36.7 million were received for the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), covering one-third of the estimated cost. An estimated $15 million came directly from the Indian community. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in September 1999, with the museum projected to open in 2004. The FY2003 appropriation included $83.4 million for facility repairs and renovations at various Smithsonian locations. The Smithsonian Institution is responsible for over 400 buildings with approximately 8 million square feet of space. A study by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) confirms that funding for repair and renewal of SI's facilities has not kept pace with need, requiring over $1.5 billion for repairs and improvements over the next decade. The Smithsonian Institution receives trust funds from private sources and government grants to expand its programs. These funds include contributions from private individuals, foundations, and corporations, as well as investment income and business revenues from various ventures. One notable contribution was $60 million from a private donor for the National Air and Space Museum's Dulles Center. The Dulles extension is set to open in December 2003. Government grants and contracts are provided for Smithsonian projects in science, history, art, and education. In FY2002, grants and contracts were projected to be $70 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a plan to track trust fund expenditures. The Inspector General noted a discrepancy in approved vs. actual expenditures. The House Committee expressed concern over controversies with benefactors' control. The Committee recommended reopening negotiations with benefactors over control of Smithsonian properties and exhibits, including renaming the Air and Space Theater. They also requested a review of benefactor agreements and compensation practices. Previous controversies regarding the proposed closure of the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education and the Conservation and Research Center were resolved. The direction of SI's research priorities remains a concern for Congress. The FY2002-2003 appropriations for institutions include funding for the Smithsonian, National Endowment for the Arts, and National Endowment for the Humanities. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities comprises NEA, NEH, and IMLS. NEA received $116.5 million in FY2003, including $17 million for the Challenge America Arts Fund. The NEA received $116.5 million in FY2003, including $17 million for the Challenge America Arts Fund. The House approved a total of $126.5 million for NEA, with a floor amendment to increase funding by $10 million. NEA's direct grant program supports approximately 1,600 grants, with over 40% going to state arts agencies. The Challenge America Arts Fund provides matching grants for arts education and community activities in rural and underserved areas. The FY2003 appropriation for NEH is $125.8 million, supporting grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. NEH also funds regional humanities centers, state humanities councils, and a Challenge Grant program to stimulate private donations. The Office of Museum Services moved to the Labor-HHS-Ed appropriations bill for FY2003. The FY2003 appropriation for IMLS is $245.5 million, with $30 million allocated to the Office of Museum Services for grants to museums. Congress debates the federal role in funding arts and humanities, with some arguing for abolishing NEA and NEH and relying on private support for cultural initiatives. Proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the federal government has a long tradition of funding culture, dating back to 1817. Some in the private sector believe they cannot fill the gap left by the loss of federal funds for the arts. Former President Clinton recommended increased federal funding for NEA and NEH, while current funding represents only 84 cents per person. The debate over federal funding for the arts often resurfaces, with concerns about previous controversial NEA grants. The NEA has faced debates over grants for potentially obscene artwork, with courts ruling on the constitutionality of decency standards. Congress enacted reforms increasing funding allocations for state arts grants and underserved populations, with a focus on arts education. The NEA faced debates over grants for potentially obscene artwork, leading to reforms increasing funding for state arts grants and underserved populations, with a focus on arts education. A 15% cap was placed on NEA funds allocated to each state, exempting grants with a national impact. Members of Congress were added to the National Council on the Arts, giving NEA and NEH specific authority to solicit and invest funds. Funding priorities and restrictions on grants were retained in the FY2003 final appropriation. The National Endowment for the Humanities, Institute of Museum Services, and Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) provide funding for land acquisition and recreational development. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015, with appropriations for federal acquisitions earmarked to specific management units. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has seen varying appropriations over the years, with a total of $25.4 billion that could have been appropriated since its inception, but actual appropriations only reaching $12.5 billion. In recent years, there has been an increase in funding for land acquisition from the Fund, with appropriations rising from $138 million in FY1996 to $573 million in FY2002. However, the FY2003 appropriation was lower than previous years. Congress has also allocated LWCF funds to federal agencies for purposes other than land acquisition and state grants in some recent years. In recent years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received varying appropriations, with funding for land acquisition increasing. However, funding for other purposes has also been allocated, with amounts ranging from $15 million in FY2000 to at least $170 million in FY2003. The FY2003 appropriation of $532 million was lower than previous years, reflecting potential budget deficit concerns and shifting priorities post-9/11. The legislative process resulted in the enactment of $414 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in FY2003, which is significantly less than previous years' appropriations. This amount is lower than both the House and Senate-passed totals, as well as the Administration's request. One example of a reduction is a $15 million earmark for land acquisition in Florida, which was lower than the proposed $20 million. Additionally, some of the Fund is allocated to other programs, with varying amounts specified for each program. In FY2003, the Bush Administration requested $200 million for the state grant program portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative aimed to promote conservation through partnerships with BLM, NPS, and FWS funds. Congress did not fund this initiative, despite strong interest in leveraging federal funds for conservation opportunities. The Conservation Spending Category (CSC) was created in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law to combine funding for various resource protection programs, including the LWCF. The FY2001 law appropriated $1.21 billion for FY2001, with total spending under the category set to increase each year. The Bush Administration did not use the CSC framework for FY2002 but requested $1.26 billion for conservation programs. The Bush Administration did not use the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) framework for FY2003, requesting $1.26 billion for conservation programs. Congress appropriated $1.30 billion, with the House passing a bill providing $1.44 billion. The CSC was not utilized due to expired legislation, but most programs previously funded under the category continued in FY2003. In FY2003, Congress appropriated $1.30 billion for conservation programs, with the House passing a bill providing $1.44 billion. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by Congress in 1996 to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The plan was completed in 1999 and federal involvement was authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. Congress authorized the Corps to implement CERP in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000). CERP aims to redirect excess freshwater to restore the South Florida ecosystem, with the federal government responsible for half of the $7.8 billion total cost. Restoration activities are conducted by federal agencies in the region under CERP and other laws. The South Florida ecosystem restoration under CERP and other laws has received significant federal and state funding, totaling over $5.5 billion from FY1993 to FY2003. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in Southern Florida is expected to be around $286 million/year for the next 10 years. In FY2003, approximately $260 million was requested for restoration activities, with $46 million allocated for CERP implementation. Over $180 million has been appropriated for restoration activities in the Everglades. In FY2003, $96.1 million was requested for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, with funds allocated to DOI agencies for CERP and non-CERP projects. The NPS requested $70.4 million for land acquisition and construction, the FWS requested $13.2 million for various activities, the USGS requested $12.1 million for research, and the BIA requested $0.4 million for water projects on tribal lands. Other restoration projects in the region have also received appropriations. Restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem have received appropriations from various government agencies including the Corps, NOAA, EPA, and USDA. Funding levels for Everglades restoration in the DOI Budget are detailed in Table 16, with allocations for park operations and activities related to CERP. Some DOI activities for Everglades restoration are not specified in appropriations bills. In FY2003, funding for restoration activities in the Everglades was reduced, with significant cuts to the Modified Waters Delivery Project and land acquisitions by the FWS. The DOI received $30 million less than in FY2002, with appropriations for the project lower than requested. Other programs related to Everglades restoration received funding at requested levels, including the Critical Ecosystem Initiative, ecological services, and research by the USGS. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated funding for restoration activities in the Everglades, including $4.0 million for the Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative and $8.1 million for USGS research. The House and Senate provided similar funding levels for NPS restoration activities, with some differences in allocations for FWS land acquisitions. The FWS sought to acquire lands to benefit restoration activities in CERP. The House provided $0.3 million for water quality studies on the Seminole Indian Reservation, not included in the Senate-passed bill but in the FY2003 appropriations law. Limited details on appropriations for FWS, USGS, and BIA for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem. USGS plans data collection, modeling, and studies in South Florida to benefit restoration activities. More information can be found in agency budget justifications and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program website. The Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program and the Corps of Engineers' website provide information on South Florida ecosystem restoration.

The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations for FY2001, FY2002, and FY2003 are detailed in the table. It includes funding for the Office of Museum Services, Challenge America Arts Fund, retirement accrual adjustments, across-the-board reductions, and firefighting efforts. The FY2003 enacted figures do not reflect a 0.65% cut in the omnibus appropriations law. $825.0 million is allocated for wildland fire emergencies, with $189.0 million for BLM and $636.0 million for the Forest Service. Conservation spending category for Interior Appropriations is detailed, including specific activities identified by Congress. The table presents the current and proposed distribution of conservation funds, including budget accounts for preserving lands, habitat, wildlife, and recreational opportunities. Some programs like Competitive Grants for Indian Tribes and FWS Neotropical Migratory Birds did not receive separate funding for FY2001-FY2003. The Administration is seeking $3.0 million under the DOI Departmental Management for the Shivaist Indian Water Settlement Act of 1999. The Shivaist Indian Water Settlement Act of 1999 authorizes LWCF funds for the Paiute Tribe in Utah. $50 million is allocated for a Cooperative Conservation Initiative, with the remaining $150 million distributed to states for land acquisition and development. Additional funds were appropriated for formula grants in FY2001, and in FY2003, four new programs are proposed to be funded from LWCF. In FY1998 to FY2003, appropriations for various programs were consolidated within Departmental Offices. The Office of Museum Services became part of the IMLS in FY2003. Funding for Challenge America Arts Fund is included in the National Endowment for the Arts total. There was no reflection of a 0.65% cut in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations law for Interior and related agencies. Additionally, $825.0 million was allocated for wildland fire emergencies in FY2003."
