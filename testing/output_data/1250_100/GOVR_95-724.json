    "content": "In Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court established that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The decision in Doe v. Bolton further clarified that states cannot overly restrict access to abortion. These rulings sparked ongoing debate and led to various governmental actions at different levels. This report provides an overview of abortion law development since 1973, highlighting key Supreme Court decisions such as Roe, Doe, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. In mid-19th century America, abortion laws followed English common law, allowing abortion before \"quickening.\" However, by the Civil War, anti-abortion movements influenced legislation to prohibit abortion at all stages. By 1910, every state except Kentucky had anti-abortion laws. In 1967, forty-nine states classified abortion as a felony. The concept of \"quickening\" no longer determined criminal liability, but some states used it to set punishment. Nontherapeutic abortions were mostly illegal, with variations in exceptions for therapeutic abortions. In 1967, restrictive abortion laws were prevalent in the United States, with only a few states allowing abortions under certain circumstances. However, this marked the beginning of a reform movement that led to the passage of liberalizing legislation in Colorado. The movement, which started in the 1950s, aimed to allow abortions in cases of grave danger to a woman's health, fetal abnormality, or pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. By 1973, approximately one-third of states had adopted provisions from the Model Penal Code to allow abortions in more situations. In 1970, four states repealed criminal penalties for early pregnancy abortions by licensed physicians. The U.S. Supreme Court's 1971 decision in United States v. Vuitch expanded abortion availability under D.C. law. Challenges to restrictive abortion statutes were made between 1968 and 1972, with mixed success in lower courts. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, finding Texas and Georgia statutes unconstitutional in regulating abortion. The Supreme Court's 1973 decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton found that Texas and Georgia statutes regulating abortion were unconstitutional as they interfered with a woman's right to decide on terminating her pregnancy. The Court ruled that states cannot categorically prohibit abortions or make them unnecessarily difficult to obtain, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's right to personal privacy. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established a woman's right to privacy in deciding whether to terminate her pregnancy. The Court emphasized that this right is fundamental and extends to activities related to marriage, procreation, and family relationships. State interference with this right requires a compelling state interest, such as protecting maternal health or the potential life of the fetus. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade ruled that a woman has a fundamental right to privacy in deciding to terminate her pregnancy. The Court stated that state interference requires a compelling interest, such as protecting maternal health or the potential life of the fetus. However, the Court held that these interests were not enough to justify an absolute ban on abortions. Instead, the state's interests were deemed compelling only during specific stages of pregnancy, with the point of viability being crucial for regulating or prohibiting abortions. Following viability, the state can regulate or prohibit abortions except when necessary for the life or health of the mother. Viability is defined as the fetus being able to live outside the womb with artificial aid. The Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade allows for medical judgment in the first trimester, state regulation for maternal health in the second trimester, and state prohibition post-viability unless necessary for the mother's life or health. In Doe, the Court extended Roe by prohibiting states from imposing unreasonable barriers to obtaining abortions, such as requiring procedures like approval by hospital committees and concurrence by two physicians. The Court also clarified that the term \"person\" in the Constitution applies post-natally, not pre-natally. The Court in Roe v. Wade emphasized that the word 'person' in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn, but did not determine when life begins. The concept of \"viability\" was introduced as the point at which a fetus can potentially live outside the womb. Post-Roe litigation addressed many unanswered questions, including public funding cases for nontherapeutic and therapeutic abortions. The Supreme Court ruled that states are not required to provide public funding for nontherapeutic abortions for indigent women. Medicaid does not mandate coverage for all medical procedures, but states are free to include coverage for nontherapeutic abortions if they choose to do so. The Equal Protection Clause does not require states participating in Medicaid to pay for nontherapeutic abortions if they cover expenses related to childbirth. The Supreme Court upheld Connecticut's policy favoring childbirth over abortion, ruling it did not violate the right to privacy. In Poelker v. Doe, the Court allowed a municipal regulation denying indigent women nontherapeutic abortions at public hospitals. The Court also found that the Hyde Amendment's restrictions on abortion funding were constitutional. The Supreme Court upheld state's right to fund only medically necessary abortions under Medicaid without violating constitutional restrictions. In Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, the Court ruled informed consent statutes requiring doctors to inform women of abortion risks and alternatives are constitutional if related to maternal health. The Supreme Court confirmed in 1979 that informed consent statutes must be narrowly drawn to not interfere with the physician-patient relationship. In City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., the Court struck down an informed written consent provision that required doctors to provide specific information to women seeking abortions. This requirement was deemed constitutionally unacceptable as it infringed on the woman's decision-making process. The Supreme Court found informed consent requirements unconstitutional as they gave the government unreviewable authority over abortion information. They also invalidated a 24-hour waiting period and spousal consent statutes, stating they were unconstitutional if they allowed the husband to prohibit abortion unilaterally in the first trimester. Additionally, parental consent statutes were addressed, with the Court ruling that statutes allowing a parent or guardian to absolutely control a minor's decision were unconstitutional. In Danforth, the Supreme Court ruled that statutes allowing a parent to prohibit an abortion on a minor were unconstitutional. Bellotti v. Baird established that a state must provide an alternative procedure if parental consent is denied. City of Akron invalidated a provision requiring parental consent for an unemancipated minor's abortion. In City of Akron, the Supreme Court concluded that the ordinance's consent provision regarding parental approval did not allow for case-by-case evaluations of pregnant minors' maturity. This differed from the Missouri requirement, which provided an alternative judicial procedure for minors to prove their maturity or best interests in court. The Court also upheld a Utah state law criminalizing abortions on unemancipated minors without parental notification. In H. L. v. Matheson, the Supreme Court upheld a statute requiring parental notification before performing an abortion on a dependent minor. The Court emphasized the importance of family integrity and protecting adolescents, allowing states to require parental notification without giving them veto power over the minor's decision. The Court rejected the argument that abortion was being treated differently from other medical procedures. The Court of Appeals decision invalidated an Illinois law requiring parental notification for teenage abortions. The ruling did not set a nationwide precedent, as other states have similar laws. In previous cases, the Court found Minnesota's requirement for notice to both parents unconstitutional without a judicial bypass procedure, while upholding Ohio's statute requiring notice to one parent with a bypass procedure. The Court upheld Ohio's parental notification statute but did not address the necessity of a judicial bypass procedure. In a Montana case, the Court also avoided ruling on this issue, leading to disagreement among U.S. Courts of Appeals. The Court found reporting requirements in Danforth constitutional if related to maternal health and confidential. In Ashcroft, the Court upheld a pathology report requirement as it aligned with medical standards and state health concerns without significantly burdening a woman's abortion decision. The Supreme Court has ruled on various aspects of abortion laws, including advertising of abortion services in other states, restrictions on nonphysicians performing abortions, and the location of where abortions can take place. In Bigelow v. Virginia, the Court found that a state cannot prohibit advertising for abortion services in another state. In Connecticut v. Menillo, the Court upheld laws forbidding nonphysicians from performing abortions. In City of Akron, an ordinance provision related to the location of abortions was invalidated. The Supreme Court invalidated Akron's ordinance provision requiring second trimester abortions to be performed in full-service hospitals, citing financial expense and health risks for women. The Court also noted advancements in medical procedures since Roe v. Wade. In Ashcroft, Missouri's similar hospitalization requirement was also struck down. In Simopoulos v. Virginia, the Supreme Court upheld Virginia's mandatory hospitalization requirement for second trimester abortions, distinguishing it from previous invalidated requirements in City of Akron and Ashcroft. The decision hinged on the definition of \"hospital,\" allowing outpatient surgical hospitals to qualify for licensing. The concept of viability in Roe v. Wade has required further clarification, particularly regarding who determines when a fetus is viable. In Roe v. Wade, the Court defined viability as the point at which a fetus can potentially live outside the mother's womb with artificial aid for a meaningful life. Viability is determined by medical judgment and can occur earlier than 28 weeks, with flexibility for advances in medical skill. The pregnant woman's doctor plays a central role in the abortion decision, as emphasized in Danforth where the Court upheld a law defining viability as the stage when a fetus can be sustained outside the womb indefinitely. Roe intended to preserve the flexibility of the term viability. The Danforth Court emphasized the importance of medical judgment in determining viability, stating that it is not the role of the legislature or courts to set a specific point in gestation for viability. Fetal protection statutes were deemed unconstitutional if they applied to pre-viable fetuses, with the Court ruling that such laws must be precise in defining viability and only apply to viable fetuses. Roe v. Wade intended to maintain the flexibility of the term viability. The Court emphasized the need for precise definitions of viability in fetal protection laws. The Court upheld the second-physician requirement in the third trimester to protect viable fetuses. However, the Court found a portion of an Akron ordinance void for vagueness regarding disposal of fetal remains. The 1983 Supreme Court decisions settled various issues related to abortion regulations. The Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in Roe, balancing a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy with the State's interest in protecting potential life. Viability, when a fetus can survive outside the womb, is a key point. State legislatures have more discretion to pass restrictive abortion laws following the Webster decision in 1989. The 1986 Missouri law upheld by the Court included provisions such as barring public employees from assisting in non-life-saving abortions, prohibiting the use of public buildings for abortions, and requiring tests for viability for women at least 20 weeks pregnant. The Court did not rule on the law's Preamble stating life begins at conception. Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized the Preamble did not regulate abortion but expressed a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion. The Webster ruling did not affect private doctors' rights. The Webster ruling, while narrow in scope, set the stage for the Court's 1992 decision in Casey. The majority opinion became splintered when reviewing a Missouri provision on viability testing at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Chief Justice Rehnquist, along with Justices White and Kennedy, found the provision constitutional due to increased costs for second-trimester abortions. Roe had previously established state regulation in the second trimester for the mother's health, with restrictions only after viability. The Webster ruling allowed states to restrict abortions to protect the fetus. Chief Justice Rehnquist proposed a new standard for state abortion restrictions based on protecting potential human life. The plurality questioned the concept of \"viability\" as the basis for regulating abortion. They found the Missouri law's viability testing requirements constitutional but did not consider overruling Roe because it did not limit abortions before viability. Chief Justice Rehnquist and the plurality in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services did not believe it was necessary to overrule Roe v. Wade. Justice Scalia would have overruled Roe explicitly, while Justice O'Connor found the Missouri law's viability provision constitutional under the existing precedent of Roe. She applied an \"undue burden\" standard and did not see the need to modify the trimester framework at that time. The Court in Rust v. Sullivan upheld HHS' Title X regulations restricting counseling on abortion with a focus on free speech rights rather than the right to abortion. The Court reasoned that the regulations did not burden a woman's right to abortion as the Government is not obligated to subsidize constitutionally protected activities. Both Webster and Rust spurred legislative activity at Federal and state levels. The Rust v. Sullivan case energized legislative activity at both Federal and state levels. State legislative proposals have been challenged in courts, such as in Pennsylvania, Guam, Louisiana, and Utah. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion while allowing some new restrictions in a 5-4 decision. Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter wrote the opinion, joined in part by Justices Stevens and Blackmun. The Court refused to overrule Roe and emphasized the importance of following precedent. The Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey introduced the \"undue burden\" standard to assess state abortion restrictions. This standard considers whether a restriction poses a significant obstacle to a woman's right to abortion. The Court upheld several provisions of the Pennsylvania statute, including the 24-hour waiting period, informed consent, parental consent for minors, and reporting requirements. However, the spousal notification provision was struck down for imposing an undue burden. The Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey introduced the \"undue burden\" standard for assessing state abortion restrictions. The Court upheld various provisions of the Pennsylvania statute but struck down the spousal notification requirement as unconstitutional. Justices Stevens and Blackmun wrote separate opinions, with Blackmun advocating for the retention of strict scrutiny analysis used in Roe. The decision allowed for more state restrictions on abortion and emphasized the state's interest in protecting potential human life throughout pregnancy. During the first trimester of pregnancy, the decision to terminate a pregnancy was made between the woman and her doctor with minimal state involvement. Under Roe, abortion was considered a fundamental right that could only be restricted by the state for a compelling interest. The strict scrutiny review invalidated most state regulations in the first two trimesters, but the \"undue burden\" standard allowed for more regulation. The Court upheld certain provisions in Casey, leading to reluctance in reviewing more abortion cases. The U.S. Courts of Appeals and congressional interest in federal legislation prompted the Court to decide Stenberg v. Carhart on \"partial-birth\" abortions. The procedure involves removing the fetal body intact, except for the skull, and is a variation of the common D & E abortion procedure. The term \"D & X\" represents both the intact D & E procedure and the D & X procedure. In Stenberg v. Carhart, a Nebraska physician challenged the state's partial-birth abortion ban statute, which prohibits the procedure unless necessary to save the mother's life. The statute defines \"partial birth abortion\" as partially delivering a living unborn child before killing it. In Stenberg v. Carhart, a Nebraska physician challenged the state's partial-birth abortion ban statute, which prohibits partially delivering a living unborn child before killing it. Violation of the statute carries a prison term of up to 20 years and a fine of up to $25,000, with automatic revocation of the doctor's medical license. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit interpreted the statute to ban both the intact D & E and D & X procedures due to the unclear definition of \"substantial portion.\" The Eighth Circuit interpreted the statute to encompass both the D & E and D & X procedures, ruling that the statute applied to the deliberate and intentional performance of a partial birth abortion. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision by a 5-4 margin. The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit's decision by a 5-4 margin, finding that the Nebraska statute lacks a health exception for the mother and imposes an undue burden on the right to choose abortion. The Court stated that a statute banning D & X procedures must contain a health exception due to the significant health risks involved. The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit's decision by a 5-4 margin, ruling that the Nebraska statute must contain a health exception for the mother and imposes an undue burden on the right to choose abortion. The Court held that the statute covers both the D & X and D & E procedures, rejecting the Attorney General's interpretation that differentiated between the two. Justice O'Connor's concurrence suggested that a state statute prohibiting partial-birth abortions could be constitutional if it included a health exception and narrowly targeted the D & X procedure. In April 2007, the Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which prohibits physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion except to save the life of a mother. Physicians who violate the act face fines or imprisonment. The Court found the federal statute constitutional and not imposing an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The federal statute on partial-birth abortion was upheld by the Court in 2007. It distinguishes itself from the Nebraska law by providing clear guidelines for doctors, including anatomical landmarks to determine when the act's prohibitions apply. The inclusion of a knowledge requirement in the federal statute addresses any vagueness concerns, ensuring that doctors will not face criminal liability if a mistake is made during the procedure. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, stating it does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The act's prohibition is narrowed by scienter requirements, limiting prosecutorial discretion. The federal statute does not encompass the D & E procedure, as it requires the delivery of a living fetus, unlike the removal of fetal parts in D & E. The act's specific requirement of an \"overt act\" that kills the fetus further shows its inapplicability to the D & E procedure. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, stating it does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The act's prohibition is narrowed by scienter requirements, limiting prosecutorial discretion. The federal statute does not encompass the D & E procedure, as it requires the delivery of a living fetus, unlike the removal of fetal parts in D & E. The Court indicated that the act's specific requirement of an \"overt act\" that kills the fetus shows its inapplicability to the D & E procedure. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, acknowledging potential instances where the prohibited procedure may be necessary. Justice Ginsburg dissented, questioning the decision and highlighting safety advantages of the procedure for certain medical conditions. She criticized the Court's ruling and emphasized the need for exceptions in individual cases. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, noting the necessity of such exceptions in previous cases. She argued that the decision was perplexing and seemed to chip away at women's rights, pointing out the Court's hostility towards abortion providers. Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, arguing that statutes burdening constitutional rights with hostility are undue."
