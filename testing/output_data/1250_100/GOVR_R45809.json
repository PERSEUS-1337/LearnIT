    "content": "Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, framing the issue in terms of national vulnerability to attacks. It defined critical infrastructure as vital for national power and highlighted four key areas of policy concern for Congress. The directive PDD-63 defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, aiming to eliminate vulnerabilities to cyber and physical attacks. Establishing consistent criteria for assessing critical assets is challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of infrastructure systems. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 also focuses on protecting critical infrastructure. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets essential to national security, economic security, public health, and safety. The policy has evolved to include provision of essential services and conveniences to the public, with a focus on protecting against asymmetric threats posed by state and non-state adversaries. Asymmetric attacks using physical or cyber means to disrupt domestic critical infrastructure systems and assets have become a concern. The definition of critical infrastructure has expanded to include events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government. Policy now emphasizes infrastructure as vital for prosperity, public safety, and civic life, as outlined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. The critical infrastructure sectors, as outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21, are essential for supporting the nation's civic life. These sectors serve as an organizing framework for public-private partnerships, coordinated by DHS, with other federal agencies playing leading roles as Sector-Specific Agencies. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress. The designation of critical infrastructure sectors has policy implications for Congress. Each sector is represented by coordination bodies with private sector stakeholders and SLTT government representatives. There is no single definition of critical infrastructure, as diverse perspectives shape the identification and prioritization of critical systems and assets. The evolving nature of these definitions reflects the varied interests and perspectives within the critical infrastructure enterprise. Critical infrastructure policy encompasses two orientations: Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and safeguarding infrastructure assets based on their consequences of loss or disruption. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness to ensure essential services during emergencies. Major legislation forms the foundation for these policies. The United States and other developed countries have shifted towards a focus on system resilience in critical infrastructure policy, moving away from solely asset protection. Legislation post-9/11 has required the identification of critical systems and assets for heightened protection against threats. This approach aims to understand what is most important and needs protection. The focus in critical infrastructure policy has shifted towards system resilience, requiring the identification of critical assets for protection. Inventory requirements are a key step in risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection at national and enterprise levels. The debate over definitional criteria for criticality continues, with list/no-list decisions defining critical assets in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets in 2003 directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying national-level critical facilities, systems, and functions. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures in 2003 directed the development of a comprehensive database cataloging critical facilities, systems, and functions with national-level criticality. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in December 2003 served as the basis for critical infrastructure policy until superseded by PPD-21 in 2013. HSPD-7 directed federal departments to prioritize and protect critical infrastructure to prevent deliberate destruction or exploitation. However, early efforts to produce a national database of critical infrastructure assets were found to have conceptual and methodological shortcomings in a 2006 DHS Inspector General report. The Department's National Asset Database grew rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006, including a wide range of assets from nuclear power plants to petting zoos. The database was criticized for listing unusual assets without clear criticality, and data collection procedures varied between cities. Legislation was passed in 2007 to create a national database of vital systems and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The Secretary determines assets with national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted. Quality control procedures ensure asset nominations meet criticality threshold. DHS improved critical asset identification processes, but questions remain about reporting criteria and methodology. NCIPP assesses criticality based on fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments made for unique CI characteristics. Adjustments were made to account for unique CI characteristics, such as the potential second-order effects of a collapse in the U.S. financial system. The report recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure the identification of the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Being listed as a prioritized asset in the NCIPP can impact government prioritization of risk assessments, regulatory regimes, grant programs, criminal prosecutions, and emergency preparedness. The exact number of nominated assets, numbering in the thousands, is not publicly available due to classification requirements. The 2013 GAO report found that some state governments were not participating in DHS data calls for the NCIPP list due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States lacked expertise to assess consequences of failure or disruption, leading to an incomplete national inventory of critical systems. DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements, indicating persistent difficulties in assuring the completeness, quality, and currency of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, NGA, and USGS, collects data on critical infrastructure assets from public and private partners for emergency planning. HIFLD includes various data layers curated by partner agencies to support homeland security functions. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database collects data on critical infrastructure assets curated by partner agencies. It includes assets essential for lifeline functions like energy, communications, and transportation systems. HIFLD also includes non-critical asset categories that may become vital during specific emergencies or policy decisions. For example, during the 2017 hurricane season, the Department of Health and Human Services used HIFLD to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which were not considered critical under common definitions but were essential for providing critical public health services. The HIFLD partnership model enables relevant agencies to use infrastructure data for real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities. Unlike the NCIPP list, it does not directly support federal oversight, regulation, and administration functions. The development of HIFLD partnerships contrasts with declining state participation in NCIPP. CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, as seen in provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act related to national preparedness against electromagnetic threats. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) require facilities to protect against cyber and physical threats. Policy changes by DHS may reduce the profile of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCIPP) and asset-protection approaches. Congress should consider updates to the National Asset Database requirements to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional appropriations for data gathering and analysis. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets align with national risk assessments sought by Congress. Risk, defined by DHS as the potential for unwanted outcomes, considers threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. This information informs planning, resource allocation, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures for critical infrastructure. Threat assessments involve evaluating potential harm to life, information, operations, the environment, and property from human adversaries or natural hazards. Vulnerability assessments identify weaknesses in assets or systems that make them susceptible to exploitation or damage. Recommendations for addressing vulnerabilities may be included in assessments. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt or destroy infrastructure systems and assets. These assessments use various technical and non-technical methods, including modeling methodologies developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups. Consequence-based criticality assessments can inform risk assessments when combined with threat and vulnerability assessments. DHS has applied these risk elements to planning, programs, and budget activities since 2007, defining risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Critics have questioned the utility of this approach. Critics challenge the DHS formula for risk assessment, questioning the accuracy of assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks. The formula, which defines risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, faces criticism due to the complex interactions between these elements. In response, DHS has recognized the need for a comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure (CI) and has proposed revisions. Legislative and executive initiatives in 2018-2019, such as the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), aim to establish a new organizational basis for CI risk assessment. The creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) elevates CI risk management as a policy focus. CISA has established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to manage national CI risk with an evolved approach emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches. Congress may request information from CISA on efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. The Homeland Security Act specifies how the Secretary of Homeland Security may leverage organizational resources for homeland security activities. The federal organization addressing critical infrastructure (CI) issues has evolved in response to evolving threats and the maturation of homeland security. Three key periods of development are outlined: initial policy development in the late 1990s, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the current transition to an all-hazards resilience framework. Federal attention to CI policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about cyber threats. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. Two years later, PDD-63 was issued to eliminate vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attacks. The Gilmore Commission found incomplete implementation of PDD-63 in 2000. The report found that the implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete, with the CIP enterprise developing slowly since 1998. The ISACs were still in early stages, the National Coordinator lacked authority for CIP responsibilities, and there was no national CIP strategy in place. The NIPC had not taken significant actions under FBI auspices. The 9/11 attacks spurred urgent national concern for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection. Two legislative tracks emerged in response to urgent national concern for homeland security. The first track favored reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with added budget authorities and oversight requirements. The second track favored consolidating government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency named the National Homeland Security Agency. Key supporters believed that dispersing security functions across various agencies had left the nation vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected the Hart-Rudman Commission's approach to consolidate counterterrorism functions under DHS, transferring infrastructure security functions from various agencies. GAO designated the creation of DHS as high risk due to management challenges. DHS incorporated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 prioritized homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism, for agencies like the Coast Guard. Before 9/11, infrastructure policy was not closely linked to counterterrorism. The Office of Management and Budget highlighted the separate but related nature of Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) to counterterrorism efforts. CIP funding for counterterrorism was minimal, representing less than half a percent of total funding requested for 2002. The White House requested $12.1 billion for the 2004 fiscal year, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels, with a focus on counterterrorism priorities across federal departments and agencies. The 2003 OMB report highlighted infrastructure programs' role in combating terrorism, leading to a redefinition of CIP as a counterterrorism mission. The creation of the DHS aimed to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions as top federal priorities. Under unified leadership, homeland security missions were prioritized with more funding transferred to a single agency post-9/11. Despite some independence retained by agencies within DHS, infrastructure security functions remained distributed across various departments. Counterterrorism remained a key focus for critical infrastructure security policy, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened by 2005. After the 9/11 attacks, homeland security missions were unified under a single agency with increased funding. Counterterrorism remained a key focus for critical infrastructure security policy, but public concern over terrorism decreased by 2005. The failure of the levy system during Hurricane Katrina highlighted vulnerabilities to diverse hazards beyond terrorism, leading to a shift in policy focus towards improving asset resilience against various threats. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued for a more balanced approach that not only protected assets from terrorist attacks but also enhanced their resilience. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued for a more balanced approach to protect assets against threats, stating that a defensive posture was \"brittle.\" Government policies and actions were said to encourage resilience as well as protection, with subsequent policy documents emphasizing resilience. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the importance of preventing terrorist attacks while acknowledging the range of challenges faced since 9/11. Threats included natural disasters, cyberattacks, and transnational issues. The QHSR emphasized the decentralized nature of homeland security, with DHS playing a leadership role in managing risks to critical infrastructure. PPD-21 superseded HSPD-7 in 2013, focusing on all-hazards resilience for critical infrastructure rather than just protection against terrorist threats. Integration with the national preparedness system was highlighted for rapid recovery from all hazards. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect of systems, making investment and maintenance homeland security concerns. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving no current statement on strategic direction. Responsibility for critical infrastructure security is still being negotiated among various stakeholders. Congress directed USDA to transfer Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS in 2002. The Homeland Security Act transferred critical infrastructure security responsibilities to DHS due to concerns about terrorist threats to the food and agriculture sector. However, in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of these functions back to USDA. The federal government's approach to critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise model emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine which aspects of critical infrastructure security belong to the homeland security enterprise and which are more related to commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. The evolving definition of homeland security blurs boundaries with infrastructure policy. DHS lacks a recent top-level strategy, prompting Congressional interest. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 aims to align DHS strategy with budgeting and interagency coordination. The Department of Homeland Security has undergone organizational changes, moving from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may need to consider the nature of intra-Departmental organization and relationships to support critical infrastructure security. The management of privately owned critical infrastructure is crucial for public safety. The management of privately owned critical infrastructure is crucial for public safety. Legislators and policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for critical infrastructure risk management, emphasizing voluntary collaboration between the public and private sectors. This model places responsibility on CI owner-operators to assess and mitigate risks at the enterprise level, while government agencies oversee risk at the national level. Investments in critical infrastructure security are primarily made by private entities, but the most serious risks are shared collectively by the public and business community. The partnership structure between government and private-sector representatives determines necessary investments in security and resilience for managing critical infrastructure risks at the societal level. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop risk management strategies voluntarily. Encouraging industry to invest in national resilience goals through public-private partnerships varies in effectiveness. Partnerships between government and private sector for managing critical infrastructure risks involve incentives for industry participation, such as improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and influencing policy. Legislation like the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 promotes information sharing, while public-private coordination councils provide a platform for policy discussions. A 2019 OECD report highlighted the importance of voluntary information sharing and collaboration partnerships in advanced economies. Voluntary information sharing and collaboration partnerships in advanced economies may not provide enough incentive for investments to achieve resilience targets. Regulatory mandates are often used in critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic impacts to spur investments. Collaborative approaches are favored as risks become more privatized and harms are more isolated. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in critical infrastructure security, as stated in PDD-63. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but limited regulatory mandates. Various agencies like TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA regulate specific aspects of infrastructure security. Other agencies like the NRC oversee civilian nuclear facilities for safety and reporting requirements. These regulations aim to prevent terrorist exploitation and ensure industrial safety. The DHS focuses on enhancing voluntary collaboration with infrastructure security partners through information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination capabilities. Current CI partnership structures operate under the authority of PPD-21 and are implemented through sector and cross-sector partnership structures outlined in the 2013 NIPP. This infrastructure protection effort is less centralized and less focused on critical asset protection than previous initiatives. The NIPP emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders for national resilience goals. NIPP partnerships at the federal level are administered by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal agencies. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) for coordination on infrastructure issues. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA). Other SSAs include EPA, GSA, and various departments. SSAs utilize NIPP partnership structures to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans, considering unique sector characteristics. Sector-specific plans analyze risks, interdependencies, stakeholders, and resilience goals. SCCs, comprising private-sector associations and CI owner-operators, are recognized by GCCs and facilitate coordination between government and private stakeholders. SCCs may also support sector-specific ISACs for information sharing. The Council of ISACs has 24 member organizations that maintain operations centers and collaborate with NCCIC and NICC. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups, including SLTTGCC, Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, and Regional Consortium Coordinating Council. These councils aim to enhance infrastructure resilience partnerships and coordinate cross-sector issues among private-sector stakeholders. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) leads cross-sector councils in developing CI risk management strategies and coordinating resource requests. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions among NIPP partnership councils and member organizations, with legal exemptions under certain circumstances. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions among stakeholders on infrastructure security topics. CIPAC engages government and private-sector stakeholders to develop policy advice for DHS. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides advice to the Secretary on homeland security matters. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on CI policy. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established to facilitate consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. It monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and encourages risk management practices. The partnership structure is flat and includes various activities such as symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. Participation often involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders from multiple sectors to promote system resilience. DHS maintains operational elements for centralized hubs in the distributed partnership structure. The DHS maintains operational elements for centralized hubs that collect, analyze, and share threat information in real-time. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) are administered by CISA to enhance industry willingness to invest in system-level resilience through information sharing and trust-building. Private sector participation in collaboration and information-sharing initiatives with federal agencies is crucial for enhancing system-level resilience. The effectiveness of these initiatives in incentivizing investments in risk reduction programs varies across different critical infrastructure sectors. Empirical analyses on collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited, with some sectors showing stronger engagement in critical infrastructure protection issues. Legislative remedies may be necessary to encourage broader and more effective investments in risk reduction where needed. Private-sector risk mitigation investment is influenced by a company's cost-benefit analysis. Government support for social costs incurred by terrorist attacks is expected by many critical infrastructure owner-operators. Challenges in DHS partnership efforts include barriers to information sharing, lack of data collection on industry participation in security surveys, and evaluation of program effectiveness. DHS has agreed to corrective measures, but GAO has not verified their progress in implementation. Overall, there is extensive partnership activity in critical infrastructure sectors, but few measures to assess effectiveness. Congress may need to explore DHS's progress in implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to evaluate the effectiveness of industry information sharing and risk reduction investments. CISA has not provided reliable data on public-private partnership programs' reach and effectiveness. Congress should consider introducing reporting requirements to address this gap. Congress may address gaps in critical infrastructure resilience through reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities. For example, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting legitimate trade systems. Oversight may be needed for underutilized regulatory authorities, such as in the case of TSA. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing, but Congress may need to consider adjustments to streamline efforts and align with federal risk management goals. To better align partnership efforts with the federal risk management approach, emphasizing inter-sectoral analysis and resilience over sector-specific asset protection.
