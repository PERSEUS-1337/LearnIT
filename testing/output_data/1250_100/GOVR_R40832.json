    "content": "This report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and highlights unresolved issues. Appendices provide a timeline of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and descriptions of international organizations involved in animal health standards. The USDA announced a new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing the National Animal Identification System. States and tribal nations can choose their own level of animal ID and traceability. All animals moving in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. USDA collaboratively built on this framework after the announcement. In the months following the USDA's announcement of a new animal disease traceability approach, collaborative efforts were made with state and tribal officials to develop a Traceability Regulation Working Group. This group synthesized feedback and made recommendations for a proposed rule. Public meetings were held to gather feedback on the framework, leading to the release of two publications outlining USDA's recommendations. Additional industry forums were conducted to further discuss the proposed rule. The USDA's traceability framework is evolving, with states and tribal nations taking responsibility for managing traceability programs. States can choose to have no mandatory animal ID, rely on existing systems for disease control, or develop their own detailed ID system. Data collection and storage will be handled by states, not the federal government. Federal rules will apply to livestock moving in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions will be defined in the rules. The USDA's traceability framework is evolving, with states and tribal nations responsible for managing traceability programs. Federal regulations will require official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection for livestock moving in interstate commerce. Exemptions, types of acceptable identification, and evaluation of traceability capacity will be defined through rulemaking. Performance standards will be set by the Traceability Regulation Working Group, with funding provided through annual cooperative agreements. Funding for animal traceability is not designated in the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill, but could be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. The USDA's new initiative will implement a program for animal disease traceability through federal regulations. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have caused economic damages and disruptions in domestic and international markets. The proposed rule could be published in April 2011, with a final rule expected 12 to 15 months later. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic animal disease outbreaks like FMD events in Taiwan and the UK. If a similar outbreak were to occur, the economic impact on the U.S. cattle industry alone could range from $30 billion to $100 billion. This has led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries, with varying levels of voluntary or mandatory programs focused on animal health and food safety. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It ranks third in pork production behind China and the EU. The US is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry exports, and third in beef exports. It is also the leading importer of beef globally. Developments in animal health, food safety, and import standards in international markets, particularly in Japan and South Korea, could impact the US livestock industry economically. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for easy tracking from birth through the marketing chain. It includes information on the animal's origins and traceability to its source. A national database combined with traceability is seen as the ideal system to respond quickly to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health. Different versions of animal ID systems exist in various countries. Animal ID systems in various countries differ in the amount and type of information collected, including details like birthplace, owner's information, movements, and slaughter location. More advanced systems also track sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. The purposes of animal ID systems include rapid response to health and safety concerns, verification of premium production processes, and in the US, a focus on animal health traceability from birth to slaughter. In the European Union, the system is more comprehensive. In the United States, animal ID systems focus on traceability from birth to slaughter. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems that track products to the retail consumer. International buyers are demanding more information on product history, leading to the need for traceability. Proponents argue that a national animal ID system enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication. A national animal ID and traceability program would aid in early detection of disease outbreaks, identify sources of disease, and minimize economic impacts by controlling and eradicating animal diseases at regional and national levels. Regionalization or compartmentalization helps contain outbreaks to specific zones, reducing the spread of diseases and minimizing the number of animals that would need to be destroyed. A national animal ID and traceability program can aid in early disease outbreak detection, source identification, and economic impact minimization. It also helps in re-establishing international market access and increasing domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers. Universal bar codes on processed food assist in managing inventories and verifying production methods for products like organic, grass-fed, or hormone-free meats. Government-coordinated programs, such as USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, provide livestock and meat producers with the ability to assure customers of consistent quality products. A traceability program, like the USDA's \"Process Verified\" suppliers, confirms manufacturing processes through audits and allows for marketing claims on breeds and feeding practices. Other programs, such as national organic certification and country-of-origin labeling, provide varying levels of traceability. Traceability programs offer management tools for producers by tracking post-mortem information on cattle and performance history of animals, increasing transparency in the supply chain, and reducing liability claims against livestock. An animal ID and traceability program addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state food safety agencies to protect the food supply from threats to human health. This program helps trace products back to processors and slaughter facilities, but there is debate within the food industry about its effectiveness. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of enhancing foreign marketing opportunities for animal products through traceability systems and export verification programs. These programs help reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals, meet foreign veterinary and food safety requirements, and certify production processes for value-added niche markets. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. Establishing an internationally recognized system of traceability is crucial for accessing foreign markets and enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. animal product exports. It is also important for achieving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health. Additionally, an animal ID system can aid in locating and rescuing at-risk animal populations during natural disasters. Opponents argue that such a system invades privacy. Critics of a national animal ID program argue that it invades privacy, increases costs, and adds technical complexity. They are concerned about the collection of personal information and production methods being a government invasion of privacy, leading to potential disclosure of proprietary information. Additionally, they worry about increased producer-level costs with no market benefit and the complexity of operations due to unknown technology requirements. The national animal ID program is criticized for its impact on family farms, particularly in the cattle industry. The program is seen as favoring vertical integration, disadvantaging smaller operators with added costs, eroding profit margins, and giving market power to large retailers and meat packers. Additionally, objections on religious grounds have been raised against the program. Some producers resist a government animal ID program due to concerns about increased tax liabilities and transparency at the farm level. The program evolved from disease eradication efforts and requires animal identification for tracking purposes. The U.S. animal ID program was successful in eradicating brucellosis from commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID requirements. Certain livestock classes have official identification requirements for interstate commerce, such as for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. However, these programs are not national in scope and vary in their approach to animal identification. After the discovery of mad cow disease in the U.S., limitations in the animal ID system were noted, impacting trade relationships with other countries. The U.S. animal ID program successfully eradicated brucellosis from commercial herds, leading to a decrease in requirements. After the discovery of mad cow disease, difficulties in tracing cattle led to the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program. However, due to criticism and cost concerns, USDA replaced NAIS with a state-based program for livestock traceability in interstate commerce. The NAIS system aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the US, excluding household pets. It was voluntary and focused on identifying animals that enter commerce or commingle with others at events. The burden of cost and implementation fell heavily on cattle producers. USDA's role in the NAIS program was to promote it, provide information to participants, address implementation issues, and collaborate with various stakeholders. They published reports with guidance, technical standards, and strategies for program participation. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability outlined recommended strategies and actions. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability by harmonizing existing animal health programs and identification techniques. The NAIS User Guide provided guidance on participating in NAIS and established data standards for premises and animal identification numbers. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to protect U.S. agriculture from animal disease outbreaks by increasing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. USDA's long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem to contain outbreaks effectively. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to contain disease outbreaks by identifying animals, their locations, and potential exposure. It consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and tracking. States and tribes had to collect specific information for premises registration to meet USDA's data standards. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required premises registration with details like contact information, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and alternative phone numbers. Each location was assigned a unique seven-digit PIN that remained constant even with ownership changes. Producers could have multiple PINs for different animal production activities. Premises had to be registered with state or tribal animal health authorities for free. The USDA maintained this information in a National Premises Information Repository to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks and protect their privacy. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required premises registration with unique seven-digit PINs for each location. By September 2009, only 37% of premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA emphasized the need for higher participation levels to successfully implement NAIS. The second phase involved assigning unique 15-digit animal identification numbers (AIN) for individual animals or groups, with the first three digits as the country code (840 for the U.S.). Tags and ID devices complying with the 15-digit AIN system were recommended. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required premises registration with unique seven-digit PINs for each location. Animal ID devices complying with the 15-digit AIN numbering system are often referred to as 840 devices. AIN devices include visual ear-tags, RFID tags, and injectable transponders for electronic reading. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders is increasing due to faster access to ID information and reduced stress on animals. Some animals exempt from NAIS identification if they pose low disease risk. USDA advises all animal owners to register premises due to disease spread risks. ID should be attached before animals move to other locations. Producers can choose when to tag animals, either at birth or later. Animals can be tagged at auction markets if not done at current premises. In some areas, tagging services are available for animals. Producers can maintain official identification on animals purchased from domestic or foreign sources. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, with a 15-character number including a PIN, assembly date, and count of groups. This practice is common in poultry and pork industries but can be an option for other species as well. The NAIS involves a uniform numbering system for livestock and poultry, with producers maintaining the GIN at their premises. The third phase focuses on timely animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during disease outbreaks. Producers can report movements to NAIS-compliant databases for standardized tracing information. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) required minimum traceback information including the national premises identification number (PIN), animal ID number (AIN) or group ID number (GIN), date of the event, and event type. Other animal-specific data like age and species were standardized but not necessary for participation. Movements within a production unit were not required to be reported. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS was a public/private partnership with industry and states operating and maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for safeguarding animal health. States and private entities, not the federal government, maintained the ATDs to ensure confidentiality. The USDA's plan involved states and industry maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for confidentiality. The federal side operated the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for officials to request information during disease events. ATDs provided timely reports on animal movements for disease containment. Retrieval of data within 48 hours was optimal. Officials used the system for foreign animal diseases, emergencies, or disease origins. As of September 2008, 40% of potential data was available. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to respond effectively to disease outbreaks. USDA estimated that 70% participation is needed for 48-hour traceback, with varying registration rates across species. Dr. John Clifford, USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer, emphasized the need for a 70-90% participation rate in animal identification programs for effective traceability. Critics have faulted USDA for slow progress and lack of clear direction towards universal ID. The Government Accountability Office identified issues hindering implementation, such as prioritization among species and data requirements. USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address these criticisms. The USDA's slow progress in implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has been attributed to differences among producers and low participation rates. Calls have been made for mandatory participation in NAIS by USDA officials, state animal health officials, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and consumer advocacy groups. Livestock industry groups like the National Pork Producers Council also support mandatory participation. Livestock industry groups, including NPPC, NMPF, and AMI, support a mandatory animal identification system called NAIS to prevent losses from diseases. Some cattle industry groups, like R-CALF and NCBA, oppose NAIS due to concerns about costs, industry concentration, and data confidentiality. Several members of Congress from districts and states with large cattle industries have expressed concerns about the authority of the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in determining whether the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) should be voluntary or mandatory. In response to industry concerns, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced in August 2006 that NAIS would remain voluntary. Proponents of a mandatory NAIS program argue that Secretary Vilsack should have the authority to make participation mandatory. The costs of implementing an animal ID system, including tags, data systems, and traceability, vary widely, with questions arising about who should bear these costs. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) raises questions about cost-sharing between industry, government, and consumers. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms, impacting smaller operations. A study by APHIS and Kansas State University in 2009 evaluated the economic benefits and costs of adopting NAIS, highlighting potential market opportunities for smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds. The report, in collaboration with researchers from multiple universities, estimated the costs of implementing NAIS across various species. Key assumptions included individual ID tagging for cattle, group ID tagging for swine (except for breeding animals), and unique group ID tagging for poultry. The estimated annual costs for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation were around $228 million for livestock industries, increasing to $304.2 million with horses included. The majority of costs were associated with the cattle sector, amounting to $5.97 per animal marketed. The annual adoption costs for the cattle sector were largely due to individual animal ID requirements, with identification tags accounting for 75% of the costs. Tagging costs varied among cattle producers, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. In comparison, other livestock sectors had lower average costs per animal: $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The study also found that the economic benefits of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) with 100% participation outweighed the costs, including savings in disease control programs, market access expansion, and avoidance of significant losses. The study found that implementation of NAIS would be more cost-effective with higher participation levels, but might not be economically viable at lower levels. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination and public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act. Animal rights extremists could misuse information obtained through FOIA, but certain business information like trade secrets are exempt. The 2008 farm bill did not include a provision protecting trade secrets in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to implement traceability requirements for imported beef by December 2010, while the EU mandates traceability for all suppliers. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) aims to pass laws for traceability requirements on imported beef, similar to domestic beef. The DPJ won a majority in the Japanese Diet but may not address this issue immediately. India is the only major beef exporter without a traceability system. The future may require beef traceability for global trade. The WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures regulates non-tariff trade barriers like traceability requirements for market access. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and not stricter than domestic standards. Despite a $142 million investment in the NAIS program, only 40% of livestock producers participated by 2009, leading to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions to address concerns and slow growth in participation rates. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April 15 to June 30, 2009, to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The sessions and written comments led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010. Congress had expressed frustration with the slow implementation of NAIS despite a $142 million investment from FY2004 to FY2009. In 2009, the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. Subcommittee chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson expressed frustration with the slow pace of national sign-up for NAIS. The full committee's report stated that continued investments in the current NAIS are unwarranted until USDA provides details on how it will implement an effective ID system. The Senate version of H.R. 2997, as amended, reduced FY2010 funding for NAIS to $5.3 million. The final FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. USDA claimed authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority or establishing a program were proposed but not adopted. In the 111th Congress, various bills were proposed to establish different types of programs related to livestock identification and meat traceability. These included H.R. 1018, H.R. 2301, S. 1292, and H.R. 3485, each aiming to improve traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry. Additionally, H.R. 814 and S. 425 sought to establish a comprehensive traceability system for animals and meat products from slaughter to consumer, with provisions for record-keeping and access for traceability purposes. The 111th Congress proposed bills for livestock identification and meat traceability, including H.R. 1018, H.R. 2301, S. 1292, and H.R. 3485 for USDA-regulated products. Traceability provisions were included in H.R. 2749 and S. 510 for FDA-regulated foods, not for FSIS-regulated meat and poultry. Hearings were held on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in the House, discussing animal ID systems, bio-security, and agro-terrorism. Animal ID in the U.S. dates back to the 1800s with hot iron brands. In the 1940s, the USDA initiated a successful animal ID program for cattle with brucellosis vaccination tags and ear tattoos. As brucellosis neared eradication, the tagging system was phased out. In the 1950s-1980s, plans for a national animal identification system were developed to quickly contain disease outbreaks. The identification efforts were further emphasized in the 1980s with the discovery of BSE in the UK's cattle population. In the 1980s, BSE was found widespread in the UK's cattle population, leading to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan resulted in $6.9 billion in losses and the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs. A major outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands led to the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in losses. In 2001, FMD in the UK forced the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing $7.9 billion. In 2002, APHIS officials helped draft an animal ID plan, and in 2003, the USAIP was developed by a group of representatives. In December 2003, a draft of the \"U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP)\" was published, outlining the recording of individual animals' movements in a central database. APHIS was tasked with designing an ID numbering system, allocating numbers to premises and animals, and coordinating data collection. Following the detection of BSE in the US, the USDA accelerated the implementation of a national animal ID system, with Secretary Ann Veneman announcing the framework for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) on April 27, 2004. Veneman announced the framework for implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in response to changing circumstances and industry input. USDA issued a Draft Strategic Plan in May 2005 with timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009. The program was initially voluntary but could become mandatory if participation levels were insufficient. In August 2006, NAIS was designed to transition from voluntary to mandatory, but later became entirely voluntary at the federal level in response to concerns raised by producers, small farmers, and religious groups. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), outlining a three-step approach to implementation. The program was intended to remain voluntary and protect individuals' private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released a user guide and additional information resource for NAIS. In April 2008, a draft Business Plan was released to advance animal disease traceability, aiming for a 48-hour traceback of affected animals during outbreaks. One of the key strategies in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) is to prioritize species, with commercial food animals in Tier 1 and all other livestock in Tier 2. The goal is to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. In 2009, a proposed rule was published to establish a standard location identifier. Public listening sessions were held to gather feedback on the future direction of animal identification and traceability. A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of NAIS was released in 2009. In 2010, USDA announced a new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing NAIS. States can choose their own level of animal ID and traceability. USDA will require all animals moving interstate to have traceable ID. Public meetings were held to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework, with proposed rules released in August 2010. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health, food safety, and trade. U.S. livestock must meet export certification standards. WTO aims to harmonize trade rules, while CODEX and OIE provide guidelines for food safety and animal health. The WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures limits non-tariff trade barriers. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission and the World Organization for Animal Health develop food standards and guidelines for consumer health and fair trade practices. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is an intergovernmental organization focused on improving animal health globally. It sets international standards for animal identification and traceability to enhance disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. OIE's Terrestrial Code includes guidelines on animal identification and tracing, with a call for progressive implementation by its Director General in 2008. The OIE Director called for global implementation of animal identification and traceability systems to allow compartmentalization during disease outbreaks, facilitating trade. Export certification ensures compliance with importing countries' standards through plant inspection and sanitary sampling. The OIE promotes international certification standards and transparency through its programs. Many countries have adopted animal identification systems with traceability capabilities, such as Canada's CCIA managing a national system for cattle and bison. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is a non-voting board member of the CCIA, which works closely with Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) to ensure funding for animal identification initiatives. Cattle identification in Canada transitioned to mandatory RFID tags in 2002 for better tracking and data integrity. CCIA reported a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% by March 2009. The Canadian cattle ID rate was 99-100%. Personal information is securely stored in the national database for authorized access during health issues. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) manages ID and traceback systems for various industry groups. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) tracks animals from birth to slaughter. Mandatory cattle ID started in 2005, while tracing systems for sheep and goats began in 2009. Australia's animal identification system dates back to the 1960s. In the early 1960s, Australia established a cattle identification system to eradicate diseases. It evolved into a mandatory Property Identification Code (PIC) system in 1967, allowing traceability of cattle. By the mid-1990s, the system transitioned to electronic RFID technology for biosecurity and market access. In 1998, individual identification became compulsory for EU market access. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) was introduced in 1999, ensuring quick tracing of animals to their origin within 24 hours. In 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, with unique ID numbers assigned at slaughter linked to bar codes. Individual animal ID information is connected to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. Australia's NLIS is a joint commitment between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government coordinating policy and funding, while state governments oversee livestock movement and health. State governments collaborate with industry to manage livestock movement and health through joint committees. They develop legislation for animal identification programs and provide education and support to producers. The state governments maintain a registry of PICs, order identification devices, and oversee compliance with legislative requirements. The database for NLIS is administered by Meat and Livestock Australia, ensuring data protection. The European Union also mandates animal identification as part of its food safety programs. The EU mandates animal identification for food safety programs, with species-specific ID systems evolving in response to disease outbreaks. In 1997, a mandatory system for bovine animals was implemented, requiring double ear tags for individual identification, cattle passports for movement recording, and a national database for traceability. The EU implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in 1997, requiring double ear tags and cattle passports. Additional regulations in 2000 made the system fully mandatory, with labeling requirements for meat products. Equidae and porcine animals also have mandatory ID systems in place. Japan has a similar system for bovine animals since 2004. Japan has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in place since December 1, 2004, tracking individual domestic animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently does not have the same traceability requirements as domestic beef, but there is growing political pressure for this to change. This system was implemented in response to food safety crises in the early 2000s, including BSE in domestic cattle and labeling scandals. The first phase began in July 2002 with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures, followed by the Food Safety Basic Law in May 2003 and the Beef Traceability Law in June 2003. The Beef Traceability Law in Japan, enacted in June 2003, extended traceability requirements to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. Japan also introduced a Japan Agricultural Standard program for imported beef traceability. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System since 2009, requiring individual identification and registration in a central database. The Beef Traceability database in South Korea tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, location, feed, medications, and slaughter details. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. In contrast, New Zealand lacks a fully functioning national animal ID system but is working on developing one under the name NAIT (National Animal Identification and Tracing). NAIT (National Animal Identification and Tracing) is still in development in New Zealand, focusing on traceability for cattle and deer populations. Existing systems like MINDA and NBTIP provide partial bovine animal ID but have limitations in individual animal traceability. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) emphasizes completing traceability for cattle and deer before expanding to other species. The NTBIP is a mandatory, herd-based system for cattle and deer traceability, while other voluntary databases are also available. Brazil has the SISBOV system for cattle identification, initially intended as mandatory but now voluntary due to lack of demand. The SISBOV program in Brazil is voluntary and focuses on providing animals to slaughterhouses for foreign markets, particularly the EU. Animal classification is done by group lot instead of individual animals. The EU has found severe shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification and traceability system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil in 2008. Concerns include a lack of robust information and the risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU from Brazil. Argentina established the Argentine Animal Health Information System (SGS) in 2003 for animal identification and traceability, focusing on cattle destined for the EU. The system includes farm-of-origin information and permits documenting cattle movements, but like Brazil, it primarily targets cattle for export markets. Official ID tagging for calves born after September 2007 is mandatory, with plans to tag the entire beef herd by 2017. Due to past disease control issues, Argentina's beef exports to the US are limited to thermo-processed beef. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006. All individual animals must be tagged before six months of age or before transport, with two tags required for cattle. The system tracks cattle from birth to slaughter to meet foreign market demands. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) requires all herds to be registered and cattle tagged by 2010. Traceability extends to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG database includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently covers the cost of ID tags but plans to shift it to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have animal ID programs in place. Many countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia lack animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations, lack of technology, and local production systems. Lower-income consumers in poorer countries are unwilling to pay extra for traceable food."
