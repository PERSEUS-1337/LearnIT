    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grants and loans, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive grant program called BTOP, while RUS received $2.5 billion for broadband projects in rural areas. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) under the RUS broadband grant and loan program allocated funds for projects in cities with over 50,000 inhabitants. The ARRA broadband funding had two rounds, with all funds awarded by September 30, 2010. The report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding, with a breakdown of applications and awards data as of October 1, 2010. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) allocated funds for broadband infrastructure projects, including last mile and middle mile projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. The projects could be in remote or nonremote areas, with a total of over 2,200 applications received during the first round application period. During the first round application period, over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding for broadband projects across all 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. The total federal funding requested was seven times the available amount. NTIA and RUS announced the second and final round of ARRA broadband funding, with $4.8 billion available, split between BTOP and BIP. Changes were made based on feedback from the first round, including separate NOFAs for each agency and the option for applicants to apply to either BTOP or BIP, but not both. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure. BTOP and BIP focused on different types of broadband infrastructure projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for middle mile projects serving anchor institutions. BIP offered a standard grant/loan combination for all last mile and middle mile projects. The requirement for projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated in the second round of BIP funding. Eligible BTOP projects required only an eligible entity, a completed application, and a nonfederal match of 20% or more. During the application evaluation for BIP's new grant programs, factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion. RUS received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in federal funds. Combined, NTIA and RUS received 1643 applications in the second round, requesting a total of $22.2 billion in federal funds, which is 26% less than the first round. In the first round, NTIA and RUS awarded $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects, including $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards were announced for 233 BTOP projects and 320 BIP projects. The breakdown of awards data includes project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. Broadband infrastructure funding was divided between middle mile projects (51%) and last mile projects (49%). Most loan funding (93%) went to last mile projects, with fiber projects making up 56% of all funded infrastructure projects. Last mile project technologies included 47% fiber, 23% DSL, 17% wireless, and others. The BTOP and BIP funding breakdown by state and per capita is detailed in tables in the Appendix. Projects must be completed within two to three years, with NTIA and RUS overseeing progress. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in FY2011. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband. ASR Analytics was awarded a $5 million contract to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability, adoption, and economic and social conditions in areas served by grantees. The 112th Congress is expected to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects, while the FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of grants could provide insights into the future of broadband grant and loan programs."
