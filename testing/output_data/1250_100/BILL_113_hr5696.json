The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act acknowledges the Joint Declaration and Basic Law, which guarantee a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong, except in foreign affairs and defense. The Basic Law of Hong Kong protects rights to free speech, press, assembly, and religion, affirms the \"one country, two systems\" principle, and aims for universal suffrage in selecting the Chief Executive. The Basic Law of Hong Kong aims for universal suffrage in selecting the Chief Executive and Legislative Council. The NPCSC determined in 2007 that Hong Kong could have universal suffrage for the Chief Executive in 2017 and for the Legislative Council in 2020. Currently, the Chief Executive is chosen by an Election Committee, with candidates needing support from one-eighth of its members, many of whom have ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The Hong Kong government's electoral reform plans limit voters to choosing from a few candidates selected by a nominating committee controlled by pro-Beijing members. Despite international standards guaranteeing the right to vote and be elected freely, Hong Kong residents have peacefully protested for genuine elections meeting these standards. The peaceful protests in Hong Kong have inspired democratic movements worldwide, including in mainland China. Reports of police using tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators, failing to protect them from counter-protestors, and accusations of excessive force are under investigation. The United States has strong economic and social ties with Hong Kong, with a significant number of American citizens and businesses present in the region. The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires reports on conditions in Hong Kong, including the development of democratic institutions. Failure to establish genuine democratic options by 2017 and 2020 would erode Hong Kong's autonomy and confidence in China's commitment to international law. The United Nations Human Rights Committee emphasized the importance of universal suffrage in Hong Kong, highlighting concerns about restrictions on election candidates. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2014 Annual Report noted threats to press freedom in Hong Kong, including violence against journalists and self-censorship. The Hong Kong Journalists Association's 2014 Annual Report highlighted self-censorship among Hong Kong journalists, ranking it at 6.9 on a 10 point scale. Hong Kong's press freedom ranking dropped to 61st in 2014, a significant decline from previous years. United States international broadcast services aim to provide uncensored information to help individuals in countries with poor human rights records, such as China, defend their rights and hold their government accountable. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The United States reaffirms its strong interest in the vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong, supports democratization, emphasizes the importance of human rights in Hong Kong, links human rights to economic prosperity, and stresses the need for Hong Kong's autonomy from China for different treatment under U.S. law. The United States supports the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong, urging China to uphold its commitments for autonomy and free elections. It also advocates for genuine democratic options for Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections by specific deadlines. Additionally, the US backs press freedom and journalistic independence in Hong Kong. The United States supports democratic aspirations in Hong Kong, advocating for autonomy, free elections, and press freedom. This includes continuing international broadcasting programming in Cantonese for Cantonese-speaking populations in China and Hong Kong. SEC. 4. REINSTATEMENT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO UNITED STATES-HONG KONG RELATIONS. Section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include reporting requirements until Hong Kong holds free and fair elections. The amendment also addresses matters where Hong Kong receives separate treatment under US laws compared to China. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 is amended to require Presidential certification for Hong Kong to receive different treatment from China under US laws. The President can waive this requirement if it is in the national security interests of the US."
