    "title": "SB 1095",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends for the genetic disease testing program to be funded by fees collected for services provided. The department will charge fees for tests and activities, with the amount determined by regulation. Fees for prenatal screening and follow-up services will be deposited in specific funds. The department will promptly implement the fee collection process. Effective July 1, 2002, the department will charge fees for newborn screening and follow-up services to hospitals or families of newborns. A fee of $10 will be charged for prenatal screening to support the Birth Defects Monitoring Program. Guidelines will be set for invoicing researchers for expenses related to research activities. The Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund is created to support pregnancy blood sample storage, testing, and research activities. Fee revenues collected for prenatal screening will be deposited into the fund and available for appropriation by the Legislature. Interest earned on funds in the fund will also support the program. The Legislature recognizes the need for efficient implementation of genetic screening program changes and maintenance of quality services. Expenditure of funds from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund for equipment and services is exempt from certain public contract code sections. The Department of Finance must be provided with documentation showing the lowest cost for equipment and services meeting technical requirements. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can be used for Tandem Mass Spectrometry screening without following certain public contract code sections. The Genetic Disease Testing Fund can be used to expand the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include additional diseases detectable in blood samples, without following specific public contract code sections. The department may adopt emergency regulations to implement this chapter without Office of Administrative Law approval. Regulations become effective immediately upon filing by the Secretary of State and must be subject to public hearing within 120 days. The Office of Administrative Law will print and publish regulations in the California Code of Regulations, which will not be repealed by the Office of Administrative Law. The health and safety of California newborns relies on a well-staffed genetic disease program funded by program fees. Section 125001 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended. The department will establish a genetic disease testing program, providing screening and follow-up services for individuals who undergo the screening. The department will expand newborn screening statewide to include tandem mass spectrometry screening for various disorders. Information on these disorders and testing resources will be provided to women receiving prenatal care and those admitted to hospitals for delivery. If unable to provide screening by August 1, 2005, the department will obtain testing services through a competitive bid process from qualified laboratories. If contracting for services is more cost-effective, the department will contract with public or private laboratories. The department will expand statewide newborn screening to include SCID, T-cell lymphopenias, ALD, and other detectable diseases in blood samples within two years of adoption by the federal RUSP or the act amending this subdivision."
