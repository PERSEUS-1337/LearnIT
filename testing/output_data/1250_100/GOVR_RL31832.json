    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. The EAA provides authority for export controls on sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the EAA. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) regulates exports of dual-use items through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce. The EAA focuses on controlling exports of civilian goods with military applications, with debates on the need to liberalize or tighten export controls for U.S. national security and international competition. The Export Administration Act of 1979 regulates exports of dual-use items through the Export Administration Regulations. It discusses the evolution of export control policy in the 20th century, major features of the act, controlled commodities, and competing perspectives on export controls. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with a shift towards peacetime export control policy after WWII and a focus on Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. The Export Control Act of 1949 established a peacetime export control system to address security threats. It identified reasons for imposing export controls, including short-supply, foreign policy, and national security concerns. This regime also involved NATO allies in regulating critical technology exports. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to regulate the transfer of critical technology from the United States to NATO allies. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times with high restrictions until the 1960s when a reexamination led to the passing of the Export Administration Act of 1969 for more liberal export controls. The Export Control Act of 1949 was renewed in 1974 and 1977 with less restrictive policies. It was comprehensively rewritten in 1979 and amended in 1985, with further liberalization in subsequent years. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 led to changes in U.S. export control policy. The export control system has been streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration, but calls for revamping persist. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and the establishment of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 also changed the export control landscape. The Export Administration Act has faced challenges in Congress for reform since the 101st Congress. Temporary extensions and Executive Orders have been used to continue export controls. Concerns exist about the effectiveness and fairness of U.S. export controls under the current system. Legislation in 2000 extended the EAA of 1979. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in multiple Congresses, with various bills being proposed but not acted upon. The Export Administration Act of 1999 was introduced in the 106th Congress, but no further action was taken after the Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor. The Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the Export Administration Act of 1999 to the Senate floor. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001, which was favorably considered by the Senate and passed with amendments. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced with similar provisions. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 2581 was amended and passed by the House International Relations Committee with 35 amendments. The House Armed Services Committee further amended the legislation and reported it out with a vote of 44-6. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held hearings but did not alter the legislation. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55) identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act has also been used to attempt to amend the export control regime. The House NDAA report expressed concerns about potential military embargoes on China being repealed, which could lead to the transfer of U.S. goods or technology. However, two provisions requiring licenses for dual-use goods controlled under the Export Administration Regulations and items exported to China were not included in the final conference report. In the 109th Congress, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced but did not receive consideration. No comprehensive legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress. Legislation was proposed to amend enforcement and penalty structures, and integrate export control information into electronic filing. In the 110th Congress, legislation was proposed to amend enforcement and penalty structures, integrate export control information into electronic filing, and target countries of diversion concern. H.R. 6828 required an investigation of BIS' validated end-user program. S. 3445 / H.R. 7112 was acted upon, with H.R. 7112 passing in the House. H.R. 3515 introduced provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The draft legislation provides additional enforcement authority for Export Administration Regulations during the lapse of the Export Administration Act. It grants investigative authority to departments and agencies under the EAR, allows for search and seizure of goods, authorizes investigations in the US and overseas, and directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish export control compliance guidelines. It also includes provisions on the use of funds for undercover operations. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements and data collection rules for exporters into the Automated Export System. It focuses on integrating export control data into the system to prevent improper shipments and address evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs. The BIS proposed the creation of a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern, including the UAE. H.R. 3515 would legislate the concept with regards to diversion to Iran, requiring the President to identify countries of concern for transhipment, reexportation, or diversion of items subject to the EAR to Iran. Countries designated would need to strengthen their export control systems within 12 months. The Administration would designate countries as Destinations of Diversion Concern if cooperation or improvements were not seen within 12 months. Countries directly involved in transhipments, reexportations, or diversions would be listed as countries of diversion concern. These countries would face additional licensing requirements and more stringent reviews. An annual report on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries and entities would be mandated. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009, with Defense Secretary Gates outlining key reform elements in 2010. Secretary Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the U.S. export control system, including creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single integrated information technology system, and setting up a single enforcement coordination agency. The changes would be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. Phase I would focus on harmonizing the Commerce Control List and the U.S. Munitions List, developing standardized licensing processes, and creating an Enforcement Fusion Center. Phase II would implement harmonized licensing processes. Phase II of the proposed export control system reform involves implementing a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists. This would lead to a significant reduction in license requirements and involve moving certain items from the munitions list to the dual-use list. The plan also includes examining unilateral controls on specific items, consulting with multilateral control regimes partners, and debuting a new export control system in Phase III. This phase would establish a single licensing agency, merge the control lists with review mechanisms, consolidate enforcement activities under a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and operationalize a single IT system for licensing and enforcement. Secretary Gates anticipates that this 3-phase plan will unfold over the next year. The 3-phase plan for export control system reform raises questions about legislative requirements and agency structure. Changes to control lists would involve multilateral consultations, and the placement of the proposed licensing agency is still undetermined. Common principles in export control legislation include national security and foreign policy considerations. The export control system in the U.S. includes various types of controls such as national security, foreign policy, and short supply controls. The controls are authorized under the 1949 Act and the 1979 Act, restricting certain items based on national security and foreign policy reasons. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes items subject to export controls, with different standards determining licensing policies for specific countries. National security control items fall under the National Security licensing requirement of the Export Administration Regulations. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) require licenses for items controlled for national security purposes. The list of controlled countries is \"Country Group D-1.\" Items are reviewed case-by-case and approved if they are deemed for civilian use or do not significantly contribute to military potential. The Secretary of Defense identifies goods and technology for national security control, periodically reviewing and revising the list. The Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) is maintained for this purpose. U.S. national security controls align with the Wassenaar Arrangement. Items not covered include those under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes, or to countries under anti-terrorism controls, which are controlled for foreign policy purposes. The Export Administration Regulations require licenses for items controlled for national security purposes. Foreign availability determinations are made to assess if items can be sourced from outside the US. If an item is deemed to have foreign availability, it must be decontrolled unless the President determines it would harm national security. The Secretary, along with other agencies, continuously assesses items for foreign availability. The bill created an Office of Foreign Availability to gather data for determinations and report to Congress. The Office no longer exists, with the Office of Technology Evaluation now handling determinations. The ETRAC committee was formed to involve university experts in technology control decisions. BIS conducted a review of the CCL and plans to review 1/3 each year. Certain licensing requirements were lifted for thermal imaging cameras to 36 allied countries in 2009. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras for export to allied countries, tightened controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras, and required exporters to report transactions to BIS. Some concerns remain about the time taken to resolve the issue, with industry sources noting delays in BIS engagement. The concept of mass market status for export control was proposed in previous legislation but is not currently included in regulations. The legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress defined mass market status for export control based on items produced or made available in large volume. This feature was controversial and cited as a stumbling block in negotiations. The Export Administration Act authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation. The Export Administration Act (EAA) imposes limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal and clear objectives from the President. It mandates negotiations to eliminate foreign availability of controlled items, compliance with international obligations, and licensing for exports to countries supporting terrorism. Exceptions include sales of medicine, food, and water resources for humanitarian purposes. Controls on agricultural products and medicines were further amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Controls based on end-use or end-user of an item, known as catch-all controls, were introduced under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative of 1991. These controls require a license for export or reexport of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security maintains an end-user list subject to these controls, with a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, and designated foreign terrorist organizations. The Export Administration Act of 1979 authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. Few short-supply controls remain, including restrictions on crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and certain exports. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process for exports of controlled goods, including crude oil and dual-use technology. In FY2008, BIS reviewed over 21,000 applications totaling $72.1 billion, with China being the largest destination for controlled goods. The average processing time for referred license applications was 27 days. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed over 21,000 license applications totaling $72.1 billion, with China being the largest destination for controlled goods. The Commerce Control List (CCL) includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes, with ten categories of controlled goods. Currently, there are about 500 ECCN listings on the Commerce Control List (CCL), which includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. Controlled items are categorized into groups such as equipment, materials, software, and technology, each with an export control classification number (ECCN) and accompanying description. Products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) may be restricted based on end-use or end-user, with some items requiring licenses even when shipped to friendly nations due to diversion risks or controversial nature. A commodity jurisdiction (CJ) is used to determine if a product is dual-use or a munition, dictating the regulatory regime. Exporters may seek a BIS commodity classification to classify their products as dual-use goods. The exporter requests a classification if the item doesn't match an existing CCL listing. BIS must refer these requests to State and Defense under set criteria, but this hasn't always occurred. Commerce was criticized for low referrals and lack of criteria. In 2008, GAO highlighted jurisdictional disputes between State and Defense due to minimal coordination and differing interpretations of regulations. Despite recommendations, the departments have not resolved these issues, leaving exporters to determine restrictions. The EAA and EAR establish review policies, but current procedures lack effective coordination. Executive Order 12981, as amended in 1995, grants the Secretary of Commerce the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses. The Departments of State, Defense, and Energy can also review licenses and may waive their right to do so for certain commodities or destinations. The Secretary must take various actions within nine days of a license application's registration, including seeking additional information, referring the application to other agencies, and making a decision on approval or denial. Other agencies involved in the review process must provide recommendations within 30 days of receiving the application or requested review information. The agency must recommend approval or denial of the application within 30 days. If no recommendation is provided, the agency is deemed to have no objection. The 1995 Order established a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism, with the Export Administration Review Board (EARB) at the top tier. The EARB includes the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) and Operating Committee (OC) are also part of the structure. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, is the third tier of the interagency dispute resolution mechanism. The Chair reviews department recommendations and informs them of his decision within 14 days. Any reviewing department can appeal to the ACEP within five days, followed by a vote within 11 days. The EARB must decide on the application within 11 days of an appeal, with a final appeal to the President within five days. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days. The process for export license application must be completed within 90 days. BIS's denial of a license must be supported by specific reasons, with an appeal procedure available. In FY2008, 422 cases were escalated to the OC. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority. President Clinton reimposed controls under IEEPA after the expiration of the EAA extensions in 1994. Export control regulations were restructured in 1996. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act in 2000, and President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Enforcement agents faced challenges under IEEPA, requiring Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status for law enforcement functions. The President lacked authority to limit federal court jurisdiction under IEEPA. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not allow the President to restrict federal court jurisdiction or extend the Export Administration Act's denial of judicial review. It also lacks a confidentiality provision for protecting export license information and does not explicitly authorize measures to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that the US's failure to enact appropriate legislation undermines its credibility when urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. The penalties under IEEPA are lower than under the EAA, but the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million in 2007. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act, signed by President Bush in 2007, increased criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for individuals. Civil penalties were raised to $250,000. The act also imposed penalties for violations involving national security controls, including fines of $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals and up to $1 million for firms. Controversial exports have included telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional focus has been on technologically advanced computers capable of complex operations. High-Performance Computing (HPC) involves complex digital operations, including supercomputers, workstations, mainframes, microprocessors, and software. The benchmark for HPC performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) using weighted teraflops (WT) was approved in 2005. The control level is set at 0.75 WT for high-end proprietary HPCs. The control level for high-end proprietary HPCs is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the 190,000 MTOPS benchmark level. Export restrictions on HPCs have been in place due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities, but some argue that restrictions are not practical. The threshold for HPC exports to Tier 3 countries was raised to 190,000 MTOPS in January 2002. The decontrol of high performance computers has had a regulatory impact on BIS, with a significant decrease in license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. Special conditions were imposed on the export of high performance computers, including prior notification requirements for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries, post-shipment verification requirements, and notification to Congress of any adjustments in the MTOPS threshold levels. Each version of the EAA in the 107th Congress included provisions for the repeal of NDAA98 regulations. Encryption technology has become increasingly important for e-commerce security and cryptography. Control authority over encryption technology was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. Licenses are still required for countries covered by anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology, categorized into materials that deflect or absorb radar signals, is sensitive for export control due to civil applications. Concerns led to reclassification as munitions in the 1990s. Congress debates controlling exports of commercial satellites and monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. U.S. satellite manufacturers were found to have provided missile design information to China in 1998. The U.S. satellite industry transferred missile design information to China through improper launch failure analysis. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce until March 1999, when authority was returned to the Department of State. The industry claims this transfer led to delays and lost sales, lobbying to reverse export controls. Commercial satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 included a provision to transfer commercial satellite components from the USML back to the CCL. The U.S. satellite industry transferred missile design information to China through improper launch failure analysis. Commercial satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 included a provision to transfer commercial satellite and satellite components from the USML back to the CCL with congressional approval. The industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls over sales of manufacturing technology, especially regarding China. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation recommended decontrol of certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for jet aircraft development and production, controlled by the U.S. Munitions List. During debates on EAA legislation, concerns were raised about decontrol of technology in commercial aircraft. The civilian aviation industry is worried about DDTC's increasing jurisdiction over aircraft parts. Section 17(c) of the EAA states that FAA-certified standard equipment in civil aircraft exported to non-controlled countries is subject to export controls under the act. In response to concerns over DDTC's jurisdiction, legislation was introduced to clarify that civil aircraft equipment under FAA regulations should only be subject to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment and not considered significant military equipment. This means suppliers no longer have to submit these parts for export approval. Suppliers no longer need to submit parts for export approval as technology transfers to foreign nationals within the US are deemed exports regulated by the Export Administration Regulations. Deemed export license applications have increased, with a significant number for Chinese nationals. The Inspector General recommended changing the standard for export controls from country of citizenship or permanent residency to country of birth. However, the Under Secretary of Commerce decided to maintain the current standard. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission suggested creating a \"trusted entity\" program for easier deemed export applications. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission proposed evaluating an applicant's loyalties based on various factors, streamlining regulations, and establishing an expert panel for annual reviews. Industry and research communities criticized the recommendations as unmanageable. The Bureau of Industry and Security sought feedback on deemed export controls and country affiliation criteria. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee has started meeting to address these issues. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) is discussing the tension between commercial and national security concerns in export administration legislation. There is a debate on reforming the current export control system to help U.S. businesses compete globally while also ensuring effective controls on exports to security threats. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and impacts. The EAA debate revolves around the foreign availability and mass market provisions, questioning the controllability of technology and the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy. Industry groups support these provisions, arguing that unilateral controls are ineffective and only harm American businesses, while foreign businesses benefit. They believe that other countries will still obtain advanced technology, regardless of U.S. controls. The current export control system is facing challenges due to globalization, with foreign businesses gaining new markets and incentives to enter new markets. Industry argues that unilateral controls are ineffective and harm American businesses, as component parts are manufactured globally and can be sourced elsewhere if not available from the U.S. Critics are concerned that industry arguments could undermine the entire U.S. control regime by decontrolling items that meet certain criteria, potentially including dual-use items used for proliferation purposes. Industry argues that national security is enhanced by robust export industries, as the military now relies more on commercial applications and off-the-shelf purchases. Selling current technology is seen as crucial for generating funds to develop future technology. Export controls hindering American firms could lead to foreign firms gaining market share and surpassing our technological advancements. The industry argues for a streamlined export process to maintain market share, increase profits, and invest in R&D. Critics oppose this, stating that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could compromise national security. They point to past instances like Iraq using U.S. weaponry against allies. Some suggest funding defense R&D within the Defense Department to control technology exports. The Defense Department is urged to maintain controls on technology exports to certain nations, but some argue that controlling computing power is not feasible or effective. The rapid increase in computing power blurs the line between super-computers and commodity computers, making it difficult to restrict access to high-performance computing. Clustering commodity computers can create systems with capabilities similar to super-computers, challenging export regulations. Some believe the US can limit access to high computer technology by restricting exports of American-made computers, which are seen as superior. Networking a parallel processing system presents challenges for those without advanced computing technology. Post-shipment verification is a policy attempted to monitor controlled goods exported to tier III destinations. Lawmakers are concerned about exports of high-performance computers (HPCs) to China, as China has restricted access to facilities containing U.S. HPC exports. The U.S. has limited monitoring efforts to verify compliance with export license terms. The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions is a multilateral regime related to dual-use goods and technology, consistent with U.S. controls. The U.S. also participates in four proliferation-related control regimes. The United States participates in four proliferation-related control regimes: the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the Wassenaar Arrangement. These groups operate based on national discretion, common control lists, and reporting requirements, but are criticized for their reliance on consensus decision-making and limited institutional structures. Critics argue that the Wassenaar Arrangement, in particular, is ineffective due to its consensus-based approach. The Wassenaar Arrangement is criticized for its consensus-based approach, which limits effective pre-export consultation among member states. Industry representatives argue that export controls are only effective if all capable states adhere to them. The machine tool industry criticizes unilateral export policies, especially towards China, where there is no consensus on technology transfer limits. Industry spokesmen fault the U.S. for overly rigorous licensing policies towards China without convincing allies to follow suit. Proponents argue that America must lead in export controls to strengthen the Wassenaar Arrangement. They believe a strategy based on consensus is ineffective and harmful to national security. Industry and advocates agree on the need to enhance multilateral controls, but consensus is lacking on which goods and countries pose a threat. The export control dilemma arises from the lack of consensus on target countries, particularly China. The U.S. faces the challenge of balancing economic benefits with national security risks when exporting sensitive technologies to China. Some argue that current controls are too stringent and hinder technology transfers, while others emphasize the importance of safeguarding national security interests. The U.S. export control dilemma involves concerns about China's acquisition of dual-use technology, evading export controls, and engaging in proliferation activities. Analysts and Members of Congress call for tightened controls and enforcement against China. On June 19, 2007, BIS published a final rule on export controls for China. The final rule for export controls on China includes a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for an end-user statement. The new controls aim to address concerns about the export of commercial technology to certain end-users in China undermining arms embargoes. The establishment of new military end-use controls on 20 product categories has received the most attention. The final rule for export controls on China introduces a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use, revises the licensing policy for National Security controlled items, and increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of the PRC. The China Rule introduces new licensing requirements for military end-use products, revises the licensing policy for National Security controlled items, and increases the exemption threshold for End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods to the PRC. Additionally, the rule establishes the Voluntary End-Use (VEU) program for trusted PRC civilian end-users, allowing them to receive eligible items without a license after approval by BIS. The VEU application process evaluates the entity's compliance record, capability to adhere to VEU conditions, and relationship with U.S. and foreign companies. On September 11, 2007, China's Minister of Foreign Commerce announced that companies seeking VEU status need authorization from MoFCom. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program. The VEU program allows approved companies to import items from any exporter, streamlining licensing processes. The program was expanded to eligible companies in India on October 2, 2007. General Electric India was the first eligible company under the VEU program in India. BIS announced the first five VEU companies in 2007, including companies like Applied Materials China and National Semiconductor. Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control raised concerns about AVIC I and HHNEC's ties to Chinese military. BIS Undersecretary Mancuso defended the companies' history of using U.S. technology. Controversy surrounding the VEU program persists, with a GAO study recommending its suspension with China due to lack of inspection agreements. Despite Commerce conducting checks under the EUVU system, companies must obtain an end-use statement from MoFCom for inspections to occur. BIS announced full implementation of the VEU to China in 2009 with agreed procedures for secure operation. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in June 2009, Representative Markey raised concerns about Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. Various agencies, including BIS, Defense Technology Security Agency, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and DDTC, play roles in regulating dual-use exports. The DDTC administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, controlling the export of weapons and military technology. Industry leaders highlight issues with the licensing system, including overlapping jurisdiction, lengthy approval times, and outdated technology considerations. Judicial review of licensing decisions is lacking. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough reviews. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) coordinates with government agencies to check end users against suspect lists and investigate issues to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into wrong hands. Some question if BIS, under the Department of Commerce, prioritizes national security over promoting exports. However, others argue that the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense ensures a balanced approach."
