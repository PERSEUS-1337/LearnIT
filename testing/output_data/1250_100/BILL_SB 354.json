    "title": "SB 354",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to apply to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The article is subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code is required for the administration of the requirements of this article. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application, including those protected under federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected. The article exempts certain public employees from its application if a federal court upholds the Secretary of Labor's determination. It also excludes public employees participating in a multiemployer plan regulated by ERISA and started before January 1, 2013. The benefit plan applies to new members as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and then by a subsequent public employer on or after that date, will be under the retirement plan available to employees of the subsequent employer before December 31, 2012, if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity established under specific provisions. An individual employed before January 1, 2013, who changes positions without a break in employment and moves to a different public retirement system will be subject to the defined benefit plan available to employees hired before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offered a defined benefit pension plan before January 1, 2013, with a lower cost formula, they can continue with that formula. However, if they adopt a new formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the lower cost formula or an approved one. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements, be approved by the Legislature, and have no greater risk or cost. New members can only join the existing defined contribution plan or an approved plan. On or after January 1, 2013, the Cities of Brea and Fullerton may form a joint powers authority under the Joint Exercise of Powers Act. This authority can offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before joining. Additionally, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may also join this authority by January 1, 2017, with a limit of three cities. (3) A joint powers authority formed after January 1, 2013, cannot exempt new employees or members from the requirements of this article. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement Systems are not required to adopt certain benefit formulas or compensation limitations. This article does not grant membership in a public retirement system to those ineligible under its rules. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with this article by January 1, 2013."
