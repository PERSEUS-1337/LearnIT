    "content": "The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) overview tracks its legislative history, budgetary context, and treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request. The Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. The bill also includes funding for certain expenses of the intelligence community. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense, which is $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. Since 2001, DOD has organized its budget requests to designate funding for activities related to terrorist attacks or distinct from regular costs. Since 2009, the Department of Defense has separated its budget into the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual caps on defense spending, with OCO funds exempt from these caps. In FY2020, the defense budget included $97.9 billion in OCO funding to stay within the spending cap. Committees treated OCO funds as part of the base budget request. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill was passed after a compromise version was agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators. The President's budget request for DOD reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The 2018 National Defense Strategy led to a shift in strategic emphasis for the DOD, focusing on increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. This marks a departure from previous national security policies that were more focused on regional aggressors and terrorism post-9/11. The 2018 National Defense Strategy shifted focus to countering threats from China and Russia, highlighting the importance of competing with great powers in the U.S. national security agenda. This came after a legacy of Cold War military superiority over adversaries, with concerns raised by events like the Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea. Adversaries continue to pose serious threats such as terrorism and nuclear proliferation. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy prioritize countering threats from China and Russia, emphasizing great power competition and the need to bolster U.S. military capabilities. Adversaries collaborate to achieve shared objectives, blurring lines between conventional and irregular conflict. Managing these complex security challenges is more difficult than in the past. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) highlights the erosion of the competitive advantage of U.S. forces against Chinese and Russian threats. It prioritizes countering China and Russia over violent extremist organizations, adopting a \"2+3\" strategy to address primary challenges. This strategic shift aims to maintain U.S. strategic competitive edge and bolster military capabilities in the face of evolving security challenges. Since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, federal government spending has increased significantly, with the fastest growth seen in mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to control federal spending through sequestration if discretionary spending budgets exceeded set caps, particularly in defense and nondefense areas. Sequestration would automatically cancel previous appropriations to meet the budget caps. The national defense budget is designated as budget function 050, with spending caps not applying to emergency or OCO funding. Congress has raised spending caps in the past, but the FY2020 defense spending cap remained at $576 billion. The Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the defense cap, but also included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but includes a reduction of 7,500 in end-strength. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay, appropriates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO), and provides $3.0 million for a pilot program for treatment of military personnel for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) includes funding for a pilot program for treatment of military personnel for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma. Additionally, the act supports the modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons as a top priority for the Department of Defense. The program also allocates $110 million to DOD's childcare program, the largest in the United States, serving 200,000 children of uniformed service members and DOD civilians. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) supports the development of hypersonic weapons to strike distant targets with conventional warheads. The Act also provides funding to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program and develop defenses against hypersonic missiles, which are difficult to detect and track. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) supports the development of hypersonic weapons and added $100 million to create a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office. House and Senate negotiators expressed concerns about duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. The Act also supported strengthening defenses against ballistic missile attacks, reflecting recommendations from the Administration's Missile Defense Review. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) allocated $515 million for developing an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) and their kill vehicle. Additionally, $285 million was provided for additional GBI missiles and support equipment, and $180 million for R&D to enhance GBI reliability. The Act also approved funding for military space satellites and satellite launches, including $40 million for the newly created Space Force. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for developing an improved interceptor missile and approved funding for military space satellites, including the newly created Space Force. The Act provided less Space Force operating funds than requested by DOD and supported upgrades to the Army's ground-combat vehicles, including increasing the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier with a 30 mm cannon. The Act also raised concerns about the Army's strategy for developing new combat capabilities and how it plans to fund them. The Army's new plan involves truncating older upgrade programs to free up funds for developing new systems. This includes using Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters as \"bill-payers\". The appropriations bill provides less than requested for Bradley upgrades but nearly triple the amount requested for the Chinook upgrade. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees challenged the Army's decision to forego upgrades to existing systems. The Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet was challenged by the Appropriations Committees. P.L. 116-93 provided funding for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program but was later cancelled by the Army. The act supported the budget request for major aviation programs and insisted on continuing the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The Army decided to curtail programs to free up funds for modernization, including truncating the procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s. The FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program, while $985.5 million was allocated for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps. Some funds were shifted to the Air Force's Research and Development account for testing purposes. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide a review of options for reducing the Air Force's fighter shortfall. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request aligns with a plan to increase the fleet to 355 ships, including funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The act deviated from the budget request by reallocating funds for Virginia-class submarines to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module. The Virginia Payload Module is an 84-foot-long section with launch tubes for additional missiles. $1.2 billion was allocated for specialized ships and landing craft for Marine Corps amphibious landings.
