The United States Weather Research Program Act of 2003 prioritizes research on hurricanes, heavy precipitation, floods, and two-to-fourteen day forecasting to improve weather predictions and warning systems. The United States Weather Research Program Act of 2003 focuses on testing and evaluating advanced data assimilation techniques in global models, assessing societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, identifying effective ways to deliver weather information, and researching the connection between weather research and improving human conditions. Additionally, research concepts are tested at test bed centers to facilitate technology transfer to operational meteorologists. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan addressing collaboration with research institutions, identifying weather information needs, dissemination methods, and research transfer practices. Reporting requirements are also outlined. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide annual reports to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, funding sources, any plan changes, and an assessment of plan objectives. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes $15 million for fiscal year 2004, $15.5 million for fiscal year 2005, and $16 million for fiscal year 2006, with at least 50% allocated for grants to institutions of higher education."
