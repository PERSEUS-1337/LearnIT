    "content": "The United States has been a global leader in developing advanced genetic technologies for crops and livestock. Federal regulators approved the first genetically engineered food, the Flavr Savr tomato, in 1994. Today, about 90% of canola, corn, cotton, soybean, and sugarbeet acres in the US are planted with GE varieties. Congress enacted the 2016 Act, requiring the USDA to establish a National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard within two years, marking the first time the federal government would require the disclosure of GE foods to consumers. The United States implemented a mandatory national standard for disclosing bioengineered foods to consumers, following the 2016 Act. The final rule was released by the USDA in December 2018, with phased implementation starting in January 2020. Stakeholder reactions to the Standard have been mixed, with some organizations criticizing it while others supported it. The Center for Food Safety, Non-GMO Project, and IATP expressed disappointment in the USDA's final GMO labeling rule, criticizing its lack of transparency. In contrast, the National Corn Growers Association, American Soybean Association, and Food Marketing Institute supported the rule, emphasizing the need for consistent information without stigmatizing technology. The American Soybean Association (ASA) and Food Marketing Institute (FMI) support the USDA's GMO labeling rule, emphasizing transparency for consumers and consistency in providing information about bioengineered foods. The report discusses agricultural biotechnology, the Standard's provisions, and potential considerations for Congress. People have been altering organisms for thousands of years, with selective breeding playing a significant role. The pace of changes in agriculture accelerated with the onset of agriculture, utilizing selective breeding to create and improve agricultural varieties. Conventional breeding and laboratory-based techniques have further enhanced the ability to modify agricultural varieties. Genetic engineering allows for specific genetic manipulation, creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The term genetically modified is more general than genetically engineered, with genetic engineering referring to techniques other than conventional breeding. The Standard addresses food labeling and does not change how foods derived from biotechnology are regulated. The federal government's Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology governs how USDA, FDA, and EPA evaluate biotechnology products. USDA regulates plants, FDA regulates food and drugs, and EPA registers pesticides. The focus is on regulating products based on their characteristics rather than the processes used to develop them. FDA and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have responsibilities for ensuring safety. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and FDA are responsible for ensuring the safety and proper labeling of foods in the United States. FDA's policy on genetically engineered (GE) foods states that they are generally similar to non-GE foods and do not require additional regulation unless they have specific characteristics. APHIS reviews GE organisms for plant pest risks, and in 2019 proposed a rule to exempt certain GE plants from review based on evidence showing minimal risk. The USDA proposed a rule exempting certain GE plants from review for plant pest risks. The Standard provides a national standard for disclosing bioengineered foods to consumers, with a compliance deadline of January. AMS oversees the implementation of the Standard, defining key terms and regulating food manufacturers, importers, and retailers. The USDA proposed a rule exempting certain GE plants from review for plant pest risks. The Standard requires regulated entities to comply by January 1, 2022, with estimated implementation costs ranging from $570 million to $3.9 billion in the first year. The RIA anticipates annual financial benefits of $190 million to $565 million, mainly from avoiding costs associated with complying with state laws and implementing the federal Standard. The new Standard proposed by the USDA addresses issues related to the applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions of genetically engineered (GE) foods. Public reactions to the controversial components of the Standard are discussed. The Standard defines bioengineering in food and specifies which entities must comply with it. The 2016 Act defined bioengineering as genetic modification through recombinant DNA techniques not achievable through conventional breeding or found in nature. The USDA's new Standard addresses issues related to genetically engineered (GE) foods, specifying that bioengineering refers to genetic modification not achievable through conventional breeding or found in nature. The Standard requires the use of the term bioengineering and sets boundaries for foods that require disclosure, excluding certain products derived from GE sources. The Standard defines exclusions for bioengineered food, including animal feed, foods with undetectable modified DNA, and certain additives. It also exempts foods served in restaurants, produced by small manufacturers, below a certain bioengineered substance threshold, from animals fed bioengineered feed, and certified under the USDA National Organic Program. The Standard defines establishments like cafeterias, food trucks, and bars that sell prepared food. The 2016 Act exempts food from small manufacturers with annual receipts under $2,500,000. It also sets limits on bioengineered substances in food and excludes animal-derived products from being considered bioengineered solely due to their diet. The 2016 Act exempts animal-derived products from being considered bioengineered solely because the animals consumed bioengineered feed. Foods certified under the National Organic Program (NOP) are also exempt from disclosure requirements. NOP certifies products produced using approved organic methods, excluding genetic engineering. The final Standard includes a List of Bioengineered Foods (the List), identifying foods available in a bioengineered form. Bioengineered versions may require disclosure, while non-bioengineered versions do not. Enzymes, yeasts, and other microorganisms produced in controlled environments were considered for inclusion on the List but were ultimately excluded. Regulated entities must determine if these substances require recordkeeping or disclosure on a case-by-case basis. AMS plans to update the List annually starting in early 2020, with opportunities for public comment and updates through the federal rulemaking process if needed. The Standard's definition of bioengineered food remains controversial, with disagreements over terminology, gene editing, disclosure thresholds, and treatment of refined food products. Some groups praise the Standard for consistency and transparency, while others criticize it for being too permissive in GE labeling. Stakeholders argue for alternative terms like GMO to be used for better consumer understanding. The definition of bioengineered food is a point of contention, with disagreements over terminology and the inclusion of new genetic technologies. Some stakeholders argue for clearer language and identification of specific technologies used in creating bioengineered foods. The lack of specificity in the Standard's definition may lead to confusion for consumers and regulated entities. The Standard's definition of bioengineered food lacks clarity on whether foods derived from new genetic technologies must be disclosed. Some interpret the definition as excluding gene-edited foods, while others argue that gene-edited foods should be required to bear disclosures. The Standard also excludes refined food products without detectable modified DNA from disclosure requirements. The Standard does not mandate testing every product for modified genetic material. Instead, regulated entities can prove absence through a validated refining process. Some groups advocate for disclosure of bioengineered foods, while industry groups support voluntary disclosure. The Standard does not require disclosure for foods with up to 5% unintentional bioengineered substances per ingredient. Other countries have lower thresholds for disclosure. The Standard for bioengineered foods requires disclosure of GMO ingredients that make up more than 5% of the total product by weight. Some advocates argue that the 5% threshold is too high. The Standard outlines options for on-package disclosure, with the disclosure required to be prominent and easily understood by consumers. Regulated entities must place the disclosure in specific locations on the packaging. The final rule for bioengineered foods requires disclosure through text or symbol options, with specific requirements for different types of foods and languages. Regulated entities can use color or black-and-white versions of disclosure symbols. The final rule for bioengineered foods requires disclosure through text or symbol options, with specific requirements for different types of foods and languages. Entities may use electronic or digital links, such as QR codes, to provide more information to consumers. The final rule for bioengineered foods requires disclosure through text or symbol options, with specific requirements for different types of foods and languages. Entities may use electronic or digital links, such as QR codes, to provide more information to consumers. The 2016 Act required USDA to study if electronic links would provide sufficient access to information while shopping, with Deloitte Consulting identifying challenges. USDA determined that electronic and digital links would not provide sufficient access, leading to the adoption of disclosure by text message as an option. The Deloitte study led to the adoption of disclosure by text message as an option in addition to other options in the 2016 Act. Small food manufacturers can choose from providing a telephone number or website address for more information. Additional considerations are specified for small and very small packages, with abbreviated on-package text options available. Regulated entities may use a label's preexisting telephone number or website address for disclosures. Retailers are responsible for disclosures for food sold in bulk containers and must use primary disclosure options. Exempt entities can voluntarily disclose bioengineered foods using provided options. The Standard allows voluntary disclosure for foods that do not require mandatory disclosure, such as refined foods derived from bioengineered foods without detectable modified DNA. Voluntary disclosures should indicate ingredients are \"derived from bioengineering.\" Critics of the Standard have sought a single, easily identifiable on-package disclosure during the rulemaking process. Some industry groups support the flexible disclosure options in the Standard, while critics like the Organic Trade Association and the Center for Food Safety find the disclosure methods unwieldy and misleading. The International Dairy Foods Association had a mixed reaction, approving some aspects of the Standard but criticizing its overall level of disclosure. The Standard's disclosure options have received mixed reactions. While some support the flexibility it offers, others like the Organic Trade Association and the Center for Food Safety find the methods confusing. The International Dairy Foods Association approved some aspects but criticized the overall transparency level. The Standard does not require disclosure of highly refined ingredients from GE foods, but allows for voluntary disclosure. Stakeholders have differing opinions on the voluntary disclosure option, with some praising it and others expressing concerns about potential confusion for consumers. OTA urges food companies to voluntarily disclose all genetically engineered foods. Administrative issues, such as compliance speed, are also a focus for stakeholders. Key administrative issues surrounding compliance with the Standard include phased implementation dates, recordkeeping requirements, and enforceability. The Standard sets January 1, 2020, as the start date for most regulated entities, with small food manufacturers given until January 1, 2021. Full compliance for all regulated entities is required by January 1, 2022. Regulated entities must maintain records for foods on the List of Bioengineered Foods to simplify the burden on them. Entities must maintain records for foods that are not on the List unless they know the food is bioengineered. Records must be kept for two years after sale or distribution, with failure to disclose prohibited under the 2016 Act. Enforcement mechanisms include audits, examinations, hearings, and public disclosure of findings, with USDA not recalling food for violations but able to enforce compliance through these methods. Compliance with the Standard is not continuously verified by AMS. The Standard allows for public complaints about possible violations, with AMS conducting audits if necessary. Stakeholder responses have focused on applicability and disclosure options, with some advocating for early compliance while others support a delay for adjustment. Some critics argue that the enforcement mechanisms of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard are weak, despite the societal context in which it was developed. State-level GE labeling approaches predated the federal 2016 Act, driven by public interest. Research shows no health difference between GE and non-GE foods, but some consumers still have concerns. Before the establishment of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, consumers demanded government-mandated labeling of genetically engineered (GE) foods. Various state laws and initiatives on GE labeling emerged, with Vermont being the first state to enact a mandatory GE labeling law in 2014. The 2016 federal Act preempted state laws and required mandatory labeling of GE ingredients in foods. Some states enacted laws or voted on ballot initiatives regarding GE labeling. Michigan and North Dakota urged Congress for a uniform standard. Proponents supported mandatory labeling for consumer rights. Opponents argued against scientific basis and potential market disruption. USDA experimented with a voluntary labeling program in 2015. Some anticipated a voluntary USDA program for certifying the absence of GE ingredients in foods, but proponents argued only mandatory labeling would meet consumer demands. PVP application for GE ingredient certification was limited to one company. Private and public-private programs offer voluntary labeling to indicate GE ingredient absence, such as the Non-GMO Project for third-party verification of processed foods. The Non-GMO Project provides third-party verification for processed foods without GE ingredients. Companies undergo review and testing, and if verified, can display the Non-GMO Project Verified symbol on packaging. The USDA National Organic Program certifies products as organic, excluding genetic engineering. These voluntary labeling programs will continue alongside the Standard's voluntary disclosure option. The voluntary disclosure option allows for foods that no longer have bioengineered characteristics to be voluntarily disclosed. The Standard does not address GE-absence claims, and FDA retains authority over absence claims. Implementation of the Standard will impact consumers, regulated entities, and AMS. Congress may monitor the implementation to ensure it aligns with congressional intent. Key concerns include applicability, disclosure options, and administrative provisions. AMS balanced flexibility for regulated entities and consumer information on bioengineered foods. Stakeholders may question if AMS's implementation aligns with congressional intent. Groups may call for amendments to the bioengineered definition to include highly refined products and new technologies. AMS will update the List of bioengineered food products annually and as needed. Stakeholders with differing views may advocate for specific foods to be included on the List during reviews. During reviews, stakeholders may push for a more expansive or restrictive listing of bioengineered foods. Consumer familiarity with required labels is a concern, as public reaction may lead to calls for revisions. The agency may need additional federal resources, estimated at $2 million annually, to implement the Standard. This would cover updating the List, audits, complaints management, and training. AMS may need to assign staff and develop new processes to implement the Standard's provisions related to audits, hearings, and publications of findings. Congress may be asked to consider allocating new resources to support continued implementation of the new Standard, with estimated administrative costs ranging from $459 million to nearly $3.6 billion for the first year. The rule relies on a public notification mechanism for enforcement, which stakeholders may view as successful or not. Stakeholders' views on the success of the new Standard may vary based on violations. Congress could be petitioned to enhance enforcement mechanisms. Consumer reactions to bioengineered labels are uncertain, with potential impacts on product demand. Manufacturers may avoid labeling some products as bioengineered to cater to consumer preferences. The Standard's implementation could affect demand for bioengineered and non-bioengineered foods. Congress may address stakeholder concerns. The implementation of the new Standard could impact the demand for bioengineered and non-bioengineered foods. Congress may address concerns about market shifts and interact with international trade partners. The USDA Foreign Agriculture Service is prepared to work with foreign countries to ensure understanding of the Standard. Congress may need to harmonize labeling requirements with foreign trading partners if trade issues arise. Definitions of agricultural biotechnology tools are derived from USDA's glossary for this report. Biotechnology involves using living organisms to modify products, improve plants or animals, and develop microorganisms for agricultural purposes. It includes genetic engineering, conventional breeding, gene editing, GE labeling, and genetic modification. Genetic engineering is the manipulation of an organism's genes using modern molecular biology techniques. DNA techniques involve genetic modification to produce heritable improvements in plants or animals for specific uses. Some countries use the term genetic engineering interchangeably with genetic modification. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are created through genetic modification, using recombinant DNA technology to join different DNA segments. Selective breeding is also used to create offspring with desired characteristics. Transgenic organisms result from inserting genetic material from another organism using recombinant DNA techniques. A variety is a subdivision of a species for taxonomic classification, known as a \"cultivar,\" consisting of genetically uniform, stable, and distinct individual plants."
