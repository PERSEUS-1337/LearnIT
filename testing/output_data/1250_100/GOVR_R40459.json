    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DOD may consume up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) purchases fuel for all DOD services and agencies, with origins dating back to World War II. Initially under the Army-Navy Petroleum Board, it became the Joint Army-Navy Purchasing Agency in 1945 and later part of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Renamed the Defense Energy Support Center in 1998, it manages a range of energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on lowest cost to delivery for various petroleum products including JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008 are compared to overall spending, prices paid, and quantities purchased. The report also discusses refining, refineries supplying jet fuel, and recent legislation affecting fuel procurement. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying them. High fuel prices have sparked interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no projects have reached commercial operation yet. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas emissions may minimally affect refineries, while legislation capping emissions could impact refinery operations and responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. DOD's fuel consumption varies yearly based on mission changes. The majority of DESC's bulk fuel purchases are for JP-8 jet fuel, ranging from 60 to 74 million barrels annually. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003, primarily for JP-8 jet fuel. JP-8 purchases have been declining since FY2004, representing 46% of DESC's overall purchases by FY2008. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% increase. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% over the same time period. The Department of Defense's fuel costs increased significantly due to rising crude oil prices and refining margins, with petroleum product costs rising from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008. Jet fuel prices reversed their price advantage over commercial equivalents, and the margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices also increased. DOD responded by purchasing commercial jet fuel at lower prices when offered by refiners. From FY2000 through FY2007, total defense outlays increased 200%, with Operation and Maintenance spending increasing by 231%. Fuel costs rose by 497% during the same period, representing 1.2% of DOD's spending in FY2000 and doubling to 3% by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil consumption annually, with the rest supplied by Canada and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. produces roughly one-third of its crude oil consumption annually, with the rest supplied by Canada, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Refineries have shifted to heavier sour crudes due to diminishing supplies of light sweet crude oil. Crude oil is processed into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel in refineries through distillation and refining processes. Refineries process crude oil into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel through distillation and refining processes. They may produce different grades of fuel depending on the complexity of the refining processes. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process, while heavier and sour crudes require more complex processing. Refineries can be set up as topping refineries, hydroskimming refineries, or cracking refineries, each with varying levels of processing capabilities. Refineries can be categorized based on their processing capabilities, with topping refineries focusing on atmospheric distillation, hydroskimming refineries adding vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking for light sour crude, and cracking refineries incorporating coking/resid destruction for medium/sour crude oil. The Nelson Complexity Index measures a refinery's complexity by rating the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity, with coking refineries having the highest complexity. Gulf Coast refineries, with an average complexity of 12 to 13, can yield jet and diesel fuel depending on the type of crude oil processed. Gulf Coast refineries in Texas and Louisiana, with an average complexity of 12 to 13, can produce up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries have upgraded processes to handle heavier sour crude oils due to changes in crude oil supplies. The EPA has mandated a reduction in sulfur content for diesel fuel, limiting it to 15 ppm by the end of 2010. Refiners are challenged to produce lower sulfur diesel to prevent contamination during pipeline transit. The DOD adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept in the late 1980s, using JP-8 for land-based equipment to minimize the fuel supply chain. The Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8, which may have elevated sulfur levels. The Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 for readiness. The EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles under the Clean Air Act. They have proposed rules for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, including emissions from petroleum refineries. Refineries emit approximately 205 million metric tons of CO2 annually, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations on GHG emissions from refineries. Recently introduced bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. The legislation would gradually reduce emissions by 83%, requiring industries to either reduce emissions or purchase allowances from others. Currently, there are 142 refineries in the U.S., with top suppliers including Shell, Valero, ExxonMobil, and BP. The companies in Table 5 operate 31 refineries in the United States, with a combined crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of refineries in the US declined, but the crude oil distillation capacity increased. Gulf Coast refineries may yield up to 8% jet fuel. Gulf Coast refineries produce up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. U.S. refineries generate ten times more commercial jet fuel than military jet fuel. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of U.S. jet fuel production but less than 1% of all refined petroleum products. DESC's jet fuel purchases exceed U.S. refining industry's output. U.S. refineries do not meet all DOD's demand for military jet fuel, leading DESC to buy commercial jet fuel and upgrade it. This strategy has reduced DESC's fuel spending due to lower prices. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply as DESC purchases fuel from foreign refineries. DOD's authority to procure fuel stems from the Navy, and DESC now relies on general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304. DESC now relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund. This allows DOD to buy supplies and services efficiently and transfer fuel to customers at stabilized prices. The term \"acquisition\" refers to the process of acquiring property or services with appropriated funds, while \"procurement\" encompasses all stages of the acquisition process. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs the Armed Forces acquisition process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) govern the Armed Forces acquisition process. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions when future costs are unpredictable, especially for refined petroleum products. Supplies and services are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions under FAR and DFARS. DESC adopted contracting instructions for multiyear contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009. DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas storage, handling, or distribution with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding twenty years. Multiyear contracts cover supplies or services for more than one but not more than five program years, contingent on fund appropriations. The key difference from multiple year contracts is that multiyear contracts procure more than one year's requirement without needing to exercise an option. Multiyear contracts for supplies allow for procurement of one year's requirement without the need to exercise an option for each program year after the first. DOD agencies can enter into these contracts to promote national security and achieve substantial cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged to take advantage of lower costs and other objectives. The Secretary of Defense can enter into multiyear contracts for supplies to promote national security and cost savings. Contracts cannot exceed $500 million without congressional approval. DOD is authorized to procure alternative fuels like coal, oil shale, and tar sands under certain conditions, with waiver authority for market conditions affecting fuel acquisition. The term \"defined fuel source\" includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived by the Secretary. DESC determines contract delivery price based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government. DESC redistributes fuel to bases and installations from Defense Fuel Supply Points. A surcharge is included in the price for operating costs. Additional costs may be incurred by the operational command for tactically delivering the fuel. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider hidden costs of fuel logistics. DOD experienced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices. The Air Force had to reduce funding in 2006 due to increasing fuel costs and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force had to reduce funding for training due to increasing fuel costs from military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. DOD has sought ways to limit vulnerability to fuel price swings, including fuel hedging and using commercial Jet A fuel to reduce costs and expand supplies. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel costs. They take advantage of swings in fuel prices, limiting risk by adjusting prices based on market rates. The airline industry uses hedging strategies like buying futures contracts to minimize the risk of future fuel price increases. Southwest Airlines successfully hedged fuel costs when crude oil prices peaked in 2008. Southwest Airlines hedged fuel costs at $51/barrel in 2008. The Defense Business Board considered hedging DOD's fuel purchases in commercial markets but favored \"no-market\" hedging through the Interior Department. They suggested using lease revenues to offset increasing fuel costs during oil price spikes. Congress has allocated Outer Continental Shelf lease revenues among various accounts, limiting the ability to transfer funds between Interior and Defense. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by Congress in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions. When filled to capacity, the SPR holds roughly 70 days of imported supply. Drawdowns from the SPR can be in the form of a sale to the highest bidder or an exchange. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization during the Persian Gulf War led to a rapid decline in crude oil prices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR, causing operational challenges for some refineries. Refineries that process heavy oil cannot operate at normal capacity if they run lighter oils, leading to potential supply disruptions for some vulnerable refineries. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) holds roughly 70 days of imported supply and can be used during oil disruptions. Refineries may face operational challenges if they have to use SPR oil, leading to a decrease in throughput. The SPR's role in mitigating a DOD fuel supply disruption is limited due to operational constraints in producing jet fuel. DOD may seek alternative fuels, but federal agencies are restricted from procuring them unless they meet specific criteria. The provision aims to prevent federal agencies from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming, in response to Air Force plans for coal-to-liquid fuels. The Air Force has dropped plans for a CTL fuel plant, but DESC is considering a pilot program for synthetic fuels in Alaska. Despite falling crude oil prices, future supply shortages and price spikes are possible. DOD is focusing on efficiency due to policy and economic constraints on fossil-based alternatives. Congress may be concerned about the refining sector's lack of response to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices. In response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps, refinery operators may question the value of emission credits compared to operating marginally profitable refineries. Congress is concerned about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel suppliers. Background information on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation is available in CRS reports. Avgas is high octane fuel for light aircraft, while DFM is used in ship propulsion plants since 1975. DF2 is the primary ground fuel. Jet A-1 (JA1) is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel adopted by international commercial aviation. Its ASTM specification is D16555 (Jet A-1), and identified by NATO as F-35. Jet A, available in the United States, has the same flash point (100 \"F) as JET A-1 but a higher freeze point. Jet A (JA) is civilian-aviation kerosene type of jet fuel, produced to an ASTM specification and normally only available in the United States. Jet B is a distillate fuel similar to Jet A-1 but with a higher freeze point maximum. It is more difficult to handle due to its higher flammability and is mainly used in very cold climates. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with additional additives, meeting U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-4. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel developed for military aircraft stationed on aircraft carriers to reduce the risk of fire. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point than Jet A-1 and JP-8, suitable for ship turbine fuel. JP-8, adopted by the Air Force in 1996, is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, with additives for safety and combat survivability. JP-8 is oily to the touch and has a stronger smell, while JP-4 is more solvent-like. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. A military installation is a base or activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements over up to five years. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used as a feedstock in gasoline production."
