UNENFORCEABILITY OF AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER USERRA. Section 4327 of title 38, United States Code, prohibits the enforcement of arbitration agreements between employers and employees for disputes under this chapter, except in cases where parties agree to arbitration after a dispute arises or in the context of a valid collective bargaining agreement. The validity and enforcement of such agreements are subject to Federal law. The validity and enforceability of arbitration agreements between employers and employees under section 4327 of title 38, United States Code, are determined by a court, not an arbitrator. This applies to all contracts and agreements between an employer and an employee, regardless of when they were established. Section 4327 of title 38, United States Code, addresses the unenforceability of agreements to arbitrate disputes. It applies to any violations of chapter 43 of title 38, regardless of when they occurred, and to all pending actions or complaints under chapter 43. Additionally, enhanced remedies for enforcing USERRA are outlined in Section 4. Section 4323(d) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to include remedies for violations by State or private employers, allowing affected individuals to claim damages for lost compensation under the chapter. The amended Section 4323(d) of title 38, United States Code, allows individuals to claim damages for lost compensation due to violations by State or private employers. This includes actual monetary losses, interest on the amount, and liquidated damages equal to the sum of the amount and interest, or $10,000, whichever is greater. Liquidated damages may be waived if the employer proves good faith and reasonable grounds for the violation. The court may award liquidated damages not exceeding 100% of compensation or damages awarded, and interest. In cases of violations by employers with 25 or more employees, punitive damages may be required if done with malice. A person initiating an action is entitled to a jury trial. The Board can order a Federal agency to comply with employment provisions and compensate for lost wages or monetary losses, including interest and liquidated damages. The Board may award liquidated damages in addition to compensation and interest for violations of employment provisions under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code. The amendments apply to violations occurring before or after the enactment of the Act. The Board may award liquidated damages for violations of employment provisions under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, occurring before, on, or after the enactment of this Act. This applies to actions or complaints filed after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5 amends provisions of title 38, United States Code to require the award of attorney fees in actions to enforce USERRA. The amendments apply to all violations of chapter 43, regardless of when they occurred. SEC. 6 clarifies the definition of \"successor in interest.\" The term 'successor in interest' for determining purposes is amended in Section 4303(4) of title 38, United States Code. A multifactor test is used to determine this term, considering factors such as continuity of business operations, workforce, and similarity in products or services. Lack of notice of a potential claim during a merger or acquisition does not affect the test. The multifactor test under clause (i) is applied to determine the term 'successor in interest'. The amendment applies to any violations of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, before or after the enactment of the Act, and to all pending actions or complaints under the same chapter. SEC. 7 clarifies that USERRA has no statute of limitations, applying to all violations of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code. SEC. 8 prohibits wage discrimination against members of the armed forces. Section 4303(2) of title 38, United States Code is amended to include wages or salary. The amendment applies to any violations of chapter 43 of title 38, regardless of when they occurred. Additionally, equitable relief is required when appropriate. The court shall use, in any case it deems appropriate, employer's denial of reemployment or retention as irreparable harm, with a presumption that harm to the denied individual outweighs harm to the employer. The court shall consider the harm to the denied individual outweighing harm to the employer when issuing an injunction for reinstatement. The amendments apply to violations of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, before or after the enactment date, and to pending actions or complaints under the same chapter."
