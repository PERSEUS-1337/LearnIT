    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"General Equivalency Diploma Reform and Improvement Act of 2001\". Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government and many State and local agencies have promoted the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) over a traditional high school degree. However, the economy now requires higher skilled workers, making the GED insufficient. Economists have found that individuals with exam-certified high school equivalents fare similarly to high school dropouts in the labor market, with poor wages, earnings, and job experiences. Individuals with General Equivalency Diplomas have lower employment rates and inferior labor market status compared to those with traditional high school degrees. Employers and the military tend to discount the value of a GED. Programs solely focused on obtaining a GED are considered misguided. Teenage pregnancy and early childbearing rates in the US have slightly decreased. In the United States, teenage pregnancy rates have slightly decreased. Approximately 3,941,553 adolescent girls between 10 and 17 gave birth in 1999. Efforts should be made to prevent unintended pregnancies and provide educational opportunities for pregnant teenagers and young mothers to become productive citizens and parents. Pregnant teenagers, young mothers, and young fathers should not receive inferior education. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REVIEW OF POLICIES. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma and review policies to improve educational opportunities for all, including pregnant teenagers and young mothers. This includes cooperating with federal agencies, working with states and local agencies, encouraging dropouts to return for training, and supporting individuals currently employed. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma and review policies to improve educational opportunities. This includes encouraging individuals to enter colleges to enhance their skills and restructuring the GED to meet current educational standards. A report with study results, reviews, and reform recommendations will be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to carry out the Act."
