    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests. Congress delayed passing the FY2013 Department of State appropriations until after the fall elections, eventually passing a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government until March 27, 2013. The House passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013. The State-Foreign Operations appropriation, which supports international affairs programs, was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). This funding includes foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international affairs programs, including foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution on March 26, 2013, which funds most State-Foreign operations accounts for the remainder of FY2013 at the FY2012-enacted level. President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, H.J.Res. 117 into law, funding the government until March 27, 2013. The bill provided 0.612% more than FY2012 levels for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities, while OCO-designated activities would be funded at the FY2012-enacted level. The annualized State-Foreign Operations funding rate under the CR was estimated to be $53.52 billion. The Senate set FY2013 funding for State Department and Related Agencies at $16.3 billion, including $1.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill totaling $40.3 billion for regular funding and $8.2 billion for OCO. This was 12% less than requested and 9% below FY2012 levels. The House allocation for the State-Foreign Operations subcommittee was $48.38 billion, which was almost 12% below the Administration's request and nearly 9% below the Senate allocation. The Senate allocated $53.02 billion for the subcommittee, 3% less than the Administration's request, including $3.2 billion in OCO funds. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request totaled $54.9 billion for State-Foreign Operations appropriations. The FY2013 budget request for State-Foreign Operations appropriations included a core budget proposal of $46.6 billion plus $8.2 billion for war-related Overseas Contingency Operations. The request represented a 2.6% increase over the estimated FY2012 funding level, with specific allocations for economic aid in the Middle East and North Africa and security aid for Pakistan. The FY2013 State-Foreign Operations budget request included an increase in funding for State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs, bilateral economic aid, and security assistance. These categories make up over 85% of the total funding requested. The budget also included allocations for International Organizations, International Peacekeeping activities, International Broadcasting, and entities like the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Institute of Peace. The FY2013 State-Foreign Operations budget request included a 4.5% boost in funding for the State Department and Related Agencies accounts, totaling $18.8 billion. This included $14.1 billion for Administration of Foreign Affairs to support key efforts such as the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and ongoing State Department-led efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department has become the lead agency for all U.S. programs in Iraq after the departure of U.S. military forces in late 2011. The State Department took over all U.S. programs in Iraq after the military forces left in late 2011. They requested 23% less funding for State Operations in Iraq for FY2013, aiming to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence. Cost-saving measures included reducing the State Department presence by 25% and cutting security contracts. The FY2013 budget request for the State Department operations in Iraq reflected reforms outlined in the QDDR, including the establishment of a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevation of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau. These reforms were implemented in 2011 without specific authorization or additional funding from Congress. The State Department's FY2013 budget request included increased funding for the Bureau of Counterterrorism and Bureau of Energy Resources to support their expansion and new positions. The House and Senate bills did not specifically mention these bureaus but could still provide funding for new hires within the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. The Administration sought additional funding to enhance the Bureau of Energy Resources' capacity and establish regional hubs in key locations. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the requested funds, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not mention the Bureau. The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations also saw a significant budget increase for FY2013, with a restructuring plan to increase agility and response capacity. The proposed changes for the Civilian Response Corps (CRC) included reducing the number of members by 76 to create a more flexible response capacity with less overhead. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 proposal continued to provide authority for transferring funds to Conflict and Stabilization Operations, while the Senate Appropriations Committee authorized the requested amount to be transferred from Diplomatic & Consular Program funding. The Administration's FY2013 request for additional human resources D&CP was $2.5 billion, with $24.9 million aimed at increasing State's staffing by 121 new positions. Secretary Clinton had initially planned a 25% increase in Foreign Service Officers by 2014, but with the proposed funding, State would have achieved an 18% growth since 2008. Additionally, $81.4 million was requested for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs. Foreign Service employees transferring abroad experienced a 23.1% cut in basic pay from their Washington, DC locality pay. This, along with lowered employer contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan, has impacted entry and mid-level employees. Congress approved prior adjustments reducing pay differentials by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request aimed to bring comparability pay level to DC rates, but the House Appropriations Committee did not fund hiring above attrition or extend overseas comparability pay authority. The authorization committee oversees overseas comparability pay, which was not included in the FY2013 proposal. The U.S. opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel, leading to funding withholding for UNESCO. The Administration sought $80 million for UNESCO in 2012. The House and Senate proposed withholding U.S. contributions to UNESCO and prohibiting funding to the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations. Both proposals included less funding than requested for UNESCO in the FY2013 budget. The Foreign Operations budget for FY2013, managed by USAID and the State Department, includes U.S. contributions to various agencies and institutions like the World Bank. The budget request totaled $36.07 billion, with a slight increase from the previous year. The budget request for FY2013 was $36.07 billion, a 0.1% increase from FY2012. It focused on foreign assistance initiatives and war-related states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. There was also a call for a new regional funding account for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. Congressional action showed differing priorities, including restrictions on funding for international family planning programs and aid conditions for certain countries and entities. The fall of governments in the Middle East and North Africa has led to scrutiny of using foreign assistance for democracy promotion. The U.S. role in political transitions in Egypt and Libya raised questions about accountability and unintended consequences. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund in its FY2013 budget to support U.S. engagement in the region. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund in its FY2013 budget to support U.S. engagement in the region. The remaining $700 million would have been unallocated funds intended for democracy incentives, humanitarian relief, peacekeeping activities, or loan forgiveness, with concerns raised about oversight and discretion. The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, increasing MEPI funding to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan are top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. The Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to these countries in FY2013, with $2.1 billion for Iraq, including $1 billion for the Police Development Program. The Administration allocated funding for the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq, emphasizing its importance in U.S. security engagement. Despite concerns about its effectiveness due to security challenges and Iraqi indifference, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad defended the program. The House legislation supported the PDP but required the Administration to report on revised personnel, scope, and costs. Appropriations from the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) program would continue funding the PDP. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $635 million in foreign operations funds for Iraq, but did not include funding for the Police Development Program (PDP) due to its unsuccessful implementation. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO. The House legislation withheld assistance to Afghanistan until security certification, while the Senate bill included $1.8 billion for Afghanistan. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, including $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF). The House legislation did not specify an aid level for Pakistan and prohibited assistance if Pakistan is uncooperative in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill included $842.3 million for Pakistan, with new conditions on aid, including withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing. The FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, with conditions on aid, including withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released. The proposed cut of $300 million in global health funding would end a decade-long growth trend, with reductions in all areas except for international family planning and the Global Fund. The House and Senate proposed funding levels for global health in FY2013, with the House providing $8 billion and the Senate proposing $8.5 billion for the Global Health Initiative (GHI). The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, aimed at addressing global hunger, requested $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds. Additionally, the FY2013 request included $134 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The FY2013 proposals included $1.2 billion for agricultural and food security, with $200 million specifically for GAFSP. The Global Climate Change Initiative requested $770 million, supporting activities like clean energy technologies and greenhouse gas reduction through sustainable landscapes. Funding for GCCI activities comes from various appropriations accounts. The House and Senate had differing positions on GCCI funding in FY2013. The House proposed zero funding for the Clean Technology Fund and Strategic Climate Fund, while the Senate recommended $111 million for Sustainable Landscapes. The Senate also supported multilateral climate change funds with $139.4 million for the GEF, $100.0 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, and $300.0 million for the Clean Technology Fund, exceeding the Administration's request. Additionally, the Administration requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, sparking debate in Congress primarily over policy concerns. Recent congressional debate focuses on two key issues: the \"Mexico City policy\" and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). The Mexico City policy, established in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. Past administrations have rescinded and reinstated this policy. There have been disagreements over UNFPA funding due to coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to the organization in 2009, and requested $39 million for UNFPA for FY2013. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities and prohibited funding for UNFPA, while the Senate legislation included $700 million for family planning and reproductive health, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both the House and Senate bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Administration proposed that the AEECA account be dissolved in FY2013 to reflect the end of an era of special focus on former Soviet and Eastern bloc states transitioning to democracy and free market economies. The request included $420.9 million in funding for programs currently funded through AEECA, an 18% cut from FY2012 funding of $513.9 million. Funding for programs under AEECA would come from ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts in FY2013. The House and Senate proposals merge AEECA funds with other accounts, with no minimum funding level specified for AEECA-eligible countries. U.S. international affairs activities are justified by national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests. During the Cold War, foreign aid focused on anti-communism and other policy interests like economic development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and the environment. After the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy shifted towards objectives like nuclear weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, religious freedom, and counterterrorism. Following the 9/11 attacks, national security became a key focus in foreign aid and diplomatic programs, with global development being recognized as a pillar of U.S. national security. Foreign assistance budget justifications began highlighting the war on terrorism as a top priority, with emphasis on aiding \"front-line\" states. The focus of U.S. foreign aid shifted towards national security post-9/11, with large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Efforts also included diplomatic security, public diplomacy in Muslim communities, and increased aid for combatting HIV/AIDS globally. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation and robust assistance to frontline states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Obama Administration's focus on national security post-9/11 led to large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Department of State proposed using Overseas Contingency Operations funds for development assistance in the front line states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress was asked to extend OCO funds to cover extraordinary costs in these countries. The OCO designation, adopted by Congress in FY2012, expanded to include funding for additional accounts and countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Budget Control Act of 2011 specified that OCO funds do not count towards budget caps, allowing war-related funding to not crowd out core international affairs activities. However, OCO funds are subject to automatic across-the-board reductions. The OCO approach is similar to past use of supplemental international affairs appropriations for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The Obama Administration criticized the practice of using emergency funds for international affairs activities, leading to a sharp increase in base funding in FY2010. Supplemental funds were still requested for emergencies like the Haiti earthquake. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. OCO allows all funding to be considered simultaneously in the regular appropriations process. In FY2013, $8.24 billion was designated as OCO, 5% less than FY2012. In FY2012, the amount requested for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) was 5% less than the previous year and 26% less than what Congress enacted. The House legislation allocated $8.3 billion for OCO, similar to the Administration's request but with more funds for foreign operations. The Senate bill allocated $2.3 billion for OCO, 72% less than requested, and did not fund the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding increased until FY2011 when Congress reduced spending to address deficit goals. Funding levels in FY2012 and FY2013 remained stable due to efforts to reduce deficit spending. State-Foreign Operations appropriations in both current and constant dollars were below the FY2009 funding level. State Department and related agencies funding trended upward in recent years, reflecting a focus on increasing human resource capacity. Foreign Operations funding, which typically makes up two-thirds of State-Foreign Operations appropriations, followed a similar trend. Unlike the State Department, Foreign Operations funding remained stable in FY2012 and FY2013. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, with Israel and Egypt historically receiving the largest amounts of aid. Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan have also been top recipients, with Iraq's aid decreasing in recent years. The top five aid recipients in FY2013 were the same as in FY2012, with Israel receiving the most aid. In FY2013, foreign aid requests for Afghanistan and Pakistan were significant, with Iraq also receiving substantial aid. Aid to Africa was set to decrease, while the Near East and South Central Asia saw increases. The Near East region's aid was mainly directed towards Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. Declines in aid were projected for the Western Hemisphere and Europe/Eurasia due to progress in those regions. The 14% decline in aid to East Asia and Pacific in FY2013 was attributed to progress in the region and global priorities. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education and health. Administration's budget requests for key interest areas decreased in FY2013 compared to FY2012. The FY2012 request saw declines in funding for Food Security, Global Climate Change, Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. Increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation in FY2013."
