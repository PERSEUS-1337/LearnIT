    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the following sections. The global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to US national security. Terrorist and insurgent groups using these weapons hinder peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Government Accountability Office estimates 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries no longer need these weapons for security but lack the means to eliminate or secure them. The United States lacks a program to address conventional arms threat reduction and tactical missile elimination in other countries. The Department of State has not used the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for this purpose since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing, removing, or eliminating MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems to combat proliferation and terrorism networks. The United States aims to help other countries safeguard or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This is part of the global program for the safeguarding and elimination of conventional arms. The Secretary of State is authorized to carry out a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This program may include activities such as humanitarian demining, destruction of small arms and light weapons, and assistance in safe handling and storage of these weapons. The authorized global program includes the elimination or safeguarding of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems using allocated funds. It also involves managing these weapons at designated locations and ensuring that equipment and funds are used for approved purposes to address proliferation threats. SEC. 5. OFFICE OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. The Department of State establishes an Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction to formulate policy and administer programs under section 4. SEC. 6. REPORT ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. The Secretary of State must submit a report on conventional arms threat reduction to congressional committees within 180 days of this Act. The report will detail past Department of State efforts, progress in establishing the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, and country-specific strategies for eliminating or safeguarding weapons. It will also evaluate the effectiveness of activities under this Act and other US Government programs. The report required under this Act and other US Government programs ensures that conventional arms threat reduction efforts align with US policy in recipient countries. It includes a description of US programs related to eliminating tactical missile systems and may have a classified annex. SEC. 7. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 authorized for the President in fiscal year 2005 under this Act, with a limitation of $10,000,000 until the Secretary of State submits the required report. The Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific Senate and House committees, \"Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund\" as a fund established under a certain Act, and \"small arms and light weapons\" as various types of firearms and ammunition. The curr_chunk mentions small arms, light weapons, hand grenades, landmines, and explosives."
