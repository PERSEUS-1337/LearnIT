The Congress finds that protecting children's health requires a caring adult and a connection to school. Schools are vital for community support and promoting health. Primary care and behavioral health services are crucial for children's well-being. School safety and violence prevention are essential, and good health is necessary for optimal learning. Children's health is crucial for optimal learning. Schools can help by promoting good health and providing access to medical and mental health care. Increasing rates of illnesses like ADHD, asthma, and obesity highlight the need for community-based prevention strategies. School-based health services can prevent future diseases, especially for children with limited access to care. Prevention strategies in school-based health programs focus on improving behavioral and physical health, including addressing obesity. Effective community-based prevention programs result in significant savings for the Federal Government and States by reducing expenditures in health services programs, which should be reinvested for further prevention efforts. Prevention programs that achieve savings should not have their funding reduced or redirected to unrelated purposes. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS FOR EXPANSION OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide demonstration grants to expand school-based health programs operated by eligible entities, including public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education and local educational agencies.
