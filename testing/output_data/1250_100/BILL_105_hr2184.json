    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997\". Congress acknowledges the rapid growth of private security officers in the United States, recognizing their role in crime prevention and job opportunities for entry-level applicants. Private security officers protect various entities such as banks, hospitals, airports, and schools, supplementing the services provided by sworn law enforcement officers. The growth of private security services in the United States has accelerated due to the decrease in public sector law enforcement officers. This trend has led to more interactions with private security personnel than with sworn law enforcement officers in daily life. Despite differences in duties, the public struggles to differentiate between the two. The demand for qualified and well-trained private security personnel is increasing. Private security personnel are seen as an adjunct, not a replacement for sworn law enforcement officers. Private security officers and applicants should undergo thorough screening, especially since many carry weapons. Background checks are required for private security personnel and applicants, especially those who carry weapons. Private security employers can request an association designated by the Attorney General to submit fingerprints for background checks on their employees. The Attorney General will search criminal records and provide results within 30 days. The use of advanced technology is encouraged for compiling criminal history information. An association designated by the Attorney General must submit employee fingerprints for identification within one business day. They must also provide criminal history records to the employer promptly. The association is required to share information with licensing authorities and regulatory agencies. The Attorney General can establish regulations for security, confidentiality, and fees. The Attorney General will report to the Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary 2 years after the bill's enactment on the number of employer inquiries under this section and their outcomes.
