    "content": "The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003\" is introduced as a new section in the Internal Revenue Code, providing a credit for affordable housing preservation. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 introduces a credit for affordable housing preservation. The credit is determined by the preservation allocation amount from a qualified preservation sale, limited to the gain recognized by the taxpayer. The preservation allocation amount is the amount allocated by a housing credit agency, not exceeding the maximum tax rate multiplied by the gain from the sale. The Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Relief Act of 2003 introduces a credit for affordable housing preservation through a qualified preservation sale to a preservation entity. The sale must include affordability and use restrictions for a specified term, enforceable and consistent with the property's long-term viability as affordable housing. The term 'eligible multifamily housing property' includes properties assisted under specific housing acts, properties with loans under the Housing Act of 1949, and properties receiving low-income housing tax credits. The term 'affordable housing' is also defined. The term 'affordable housing' refers to qualified low-income housing projects. The term 'extended use period' is the period after sale, lasting 30 years or until foreclosure. A 'preservation entity' is an agency or organization approved by a housing credit agency to acquire and preserve eligible multifamily housing properties independently. The State preservation credit ceiling is allocated to housing credit agencies for the preservation of affordable housing projects. The allocation is based on the State preservation credit ceiling for the calendar year, which includes unused credits from the previous year. If a State has multiple housing credit agencies, they are treated as a single agency for allocation purposes. The State preservation credit ceiling is calculated based on the State population, a fixed amount, returned credit ceiling, and any additional allocation from the Secretary. Any unused credit is carried over to the next year. Unallocated credit is distributed among qualified States for the following year. The term 'qualified State' refers to a State that allocates its entire preservation credit from the previous year and requests an allocation for the current year. The unused preservation credit carryover is the excess of the previous year's unused credit ceiling over the allocated amount. The allocated amount is determined by the Secretary based on the ratio of the aggregate unused preservation credit carryover of all States. The housing credit agency is responsible for ensuring the viability of rehabilitation plans for eligible multifamily housing properties, monitoring affordability restrictions, and reporting noncompliance to the IRS. The Secretary can increase the taxpayer's tax if multifamily housing property is out of compliance with requirements. The tax increase includes an amount based on the noncompliant portion and interest for prior years. The tax code is amended to include a new affordable housing preservation credit under section 42A(a). A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The tax code is amended to include a new affordable housing preservation credit under section 42A. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
