TERMINATION OF DETERMINATIONS OF GRANDFATHER RIGHTS. The amendment to Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, introduces a provision for Grandfather Rights, stating that no State can allow the operation of any vehicle not in conformance with Interstate weight limits unless it is on a published list.

Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to define nondivisible loads and establish regulations for them on the National Highway System. The policy aims to promote conformity with Interstate weight limits for the safety of all motorists.

These limits are defined to ensure safety for all motorists. SEC. 5. WEIGHT LIMITATIONS. Title 23, United States Code, is amended to include new section 127a regarding gross vehicle weight and axle loading limitations on non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System. The limitations set by State statute as of January 1, 1997, apply to existing highways, while Interstate weight limits apply to new segments. The legislation also includes a provision for publishing a list of State limitations. The Secretary will publish a list of State weight limitations for non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System as of January 1, 1997. Additionally, a list of nonconforming operations will be published for vehicles not in compliance with State weight limits before January 1, 1997. The enactment of this section prohibits certain vehicle operations based on State laws or regulations. Vehicles on the Secretary's list must comply with routing, commodity, and weight designations in force by December 31, 1996. New designations to the National Highway System must adhere to the limitations set in subsection (a). States can reduce weight limitations on non-Interstate highways. Interstate weight limits are defined as 80,000 pounds. The term 'Interstate weight limits' refer to the 80,000 pound gross vehicle weight limitation, the 20,000 pound single axle weight limitation, and the 34,000 pound tandem axle weight limitation. Enforcement of requirements is amended to include sections 127 and 127a. The chapter analysis is updated to reflect these changes. Gross vehicle weight and axle loading limitations on non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System are addressed in section 127a."
