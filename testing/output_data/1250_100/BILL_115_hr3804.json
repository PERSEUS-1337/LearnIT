    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\". The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and security measures. It emphasizes the need for federal support in integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development to reduce post-disaster recovery costs for taxpayers. Disaster planning should focus on prevention and incorporate mitigation strategies from various professional fields. Comprehensive planning can reduce risks from natural disasters and terrorist acts, requiring federal and state support for a conducive planning environment. Many states need to update land use statutes to enable comprehensive planning for safe communities. Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments with local plans require additional State level planning. Comprehensive urban planning considers land use, transportation systems, water facilities, and open space in promoting safe communities. Local governments should integrate safety into planning efforts, ensuring safe housing options for all community members. Prevailing land use patterns often put people and environmental systems at risk. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. This includes creating or revising State and local land use planning statutes that incorporate risk reduction and hazard mitigation, as well as developing comprehensive land use plans for multi-State regions. To be eligible for a grant under the program, a State or local planning director must submit an application demonstrating consistency with guidelines on citizen engagement, multi-jurisdictional cooperation, and multi-agency coordination in land use planning legislation and regulation. The implementation elements of land use plans include a timetable for action, roles and responsibilities, and consistency with capital budget objectives. Comprehensive planning encourages incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into State or locally adopted plans, urban design guidelines, and building codes. The State or local government must update comprehensive plans, including land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans over time. Grant funds can be used for developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation, assessing public infrastructure, and developing geographical information systems. Developing geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability, incorporating mitigation and security in transportation plans, encouraging interagency cooperation, and identifying natural hazard areas for integration into comprehensive plans and regulations. The grant amount for projects is capped at $1,125,000, with a maximum Federal share of 90%. The Secretary can increase the Federal share for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations lacking funds. Coordination is required between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. Audits are conducted by the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security will audit grants to ensure funds are used as specified. Audit results will influence future grant awards. Definitions include land use planning legislation and comprehensive plan. The curr_chunk discusses the regulation and management of land, natural resources, development practices, and infrastructure investments related to future land use and urban development. It defines terms like \"State,\" \"State planning director,\" and \"local planning director.\" The curr_chunk defines \"local planning director\" as a local official responsible for drafting and updating local comprehensive plans, and \"Tribal government\" as the government of an Indian Tribe. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on land use and community planning to enhance security against natural hazards and terrorism. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on communities, and using mapping tools for risk assessment. A report on best practices in community security planning will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate land use codes, software tools, security design standards, and infrastructure planning practices to enhance safety against natural hazards and terrorism. Regional, State, and local differences will be considered, focusing on risk reduction and cost-effectiveness. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023 totaling $57,250,000, with $56,250,000 allocated for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
