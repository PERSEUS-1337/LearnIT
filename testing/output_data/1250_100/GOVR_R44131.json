    "content": "The U.S. Navy's Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) aircraft and its predecessors have faced controversy and delays in determining final requirements. Congressional actions have been proposed to resolve these issues and move the program forward. Research into unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) began in 1999 with separate projects by the Navy and the Air Force in collaboration with DARPA. The Navy's UCAV project, known as N-UCAV, was designed for reconnaissance missions and identifying targets in protected airspace. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under the program. In 2003, the Navy and Air Force merged their UCAV efforts into the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program to demonstrate technical feasibility and military utility. The J-UCAS program was a joint effort by DARPA, Air Force, and Navy to demonstrate the feasibility and military value of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. However, the program was terminated, leading to the development of the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) focused on persistent surveillance and penetrating capabilities from aircraft carriers. The Navy initiated the UCAS-D program in 2006 to demonstrate operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. The program aimed to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance the Navy's ability to operate in highly contested environments. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in UCAS-D and later received approval to plan for the UCLASS acquisition program. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document to enhance the Navy's ability to operate in contested environments. Changes in requirements for UCLASS favored permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. The JROCM directives redefined the scope of UCLASS missions to support a range of operations, emphasizing affordability as a top priority. The Navy issued a draft RFP for the UCLASS system with requirements focused on affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The UCLASS program aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits over uncontested airspace with a light strike capability. The design allows for growth to operate in contested environments, with the end goal of an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike and expanded missions. The procurement timeline for UCLASS is unclear, with ongoing delays due to changes in requirements. The Navy now expects to award the air system contract in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a delay of around 2 years. The Milestone A review is also delayed to fiscal year 2017. The UCLASS program has experienced delays in procurement, with the air system contract now expected to be awarded in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. Further reviews and changes in DOD priorities may lead to evolving requirements."
