    "content": "Recent deep generative models have shown the potential to produce realistic images and embeddings useful for computer vision and natural language tasks. To address limitations in control and understanding of these models, recent research focuses on studying the semantics of the latent space. A new method is proposed in this paper to enhance interpretability by finding meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over image properties like object position or scale. This weakly supervised approach is effective for simple image transformations and has been demonstrated on GANs and variational auto-encoders. Recent generative models have shown success in producing high-resolution images for various applications like image in-painting and deep-fakes. However, control over generated images is limited. Efforts to enhance control include modifying attributes of generated images through learned vectors or combining latent codes. Studying the latent space of generative models provides insights into their structure and potential for unsupervised data representations. The latent spaces of generative models exhibit a vector space structure encoding factors of variations like object presence, position, and lighting. Factors of variations are categorized as modal (discrete values) and continuous (range of values). Describing images using factors of variations is efficient and promising for image generation control. In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in image generation. The method does not require labeled data or an encoder model. It focuses on factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, demonstrating effectiveness quantitatively. It can be adapted to other variations like rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. The method proposed in the paper allows for precise control over specific factors of variations in image generation without the need for labeled data or an encoder model. It focuses on properties like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, demonstrating effectiveness both qualitatively and quantitatively. The method can be adapted to control other variations such as rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. The method proposed allows for precise control over factors of variations in image generation without labeled data or an encoder model. It focuses on properties like position and scale, demonstrating effectiveness. The generative model G maps latent space Z to images in space I, with transformations T characterized by a continuous parameter. The goal is to find the latent code of a transformed image to estimate the direction encoding the factor of variation. When no encoder is available, an approximate latent code can be found by minimizing a reconstruction error between the generated image and its projection. The optimization problem in image generation involves choosing the reconstruction error, with pixel-wise losses often leading to blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed to address this issue, but they are computationally expensive. The poor performance of pixel-wise mean square error is attributed to favoring the expected value of all possibilities. Further study is proposed to understand the effect of MSE on images in the frequency domain. Our hypothesis is that the generator's limited capacity and low-dimensional latent space result in textures being reconstructed as uniform regions with pixel-wise errors. By reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function, sharper results can be achieved in image generation. The text discusses the importance of generating images with more details and appropriate texture for realism. It compares reconstruction errors and different loss functions, including the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) is addressed, along with the challenges of using an L2 penalty. The process involves creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to transformations in the pixel space. The text discusses the challenges of optimizing the generation of realistic images in pixel space. It highlights the difficulty of convergence due to the highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images. To address this, the transformation is decomposed into smaller transformations to guide optimization on the manifold. Our approach decomposes the transformation into smaller steps for sequential optimization without requiring extra training. We address challenges such as undefined regions in transformed images and outliers in generative models. The impact of outliers is addressed by discarding latent codes with high reconstruction errors in generated trajectories. Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories in the latent space, followed by defining a model to encode factors of variations. The model predicts a factor's parameter from the latent code coordinate along an axis, assuming a monotonic increasing function. The distribution of factors is determined by the model, such as the horizontal position of an object in the dSprite dataset. The distribution of parameters in the dataset is modeled using a parametrized function g \u03b8, with trainable parameters \u03b8 and u. To address the issue of unknown parameters, the model estimates \u03b4t instead of t by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between \u03b4t and the model's output. This method allows for the estimation of image distributions and sampling images based on the learned function g \u03b8. The curr_chunk discusses the ability to control image sampling using an arbitrary distribution, transforming z \u223c N (0, 1) with h \u03c6 : [0, 1] \u2192 R and \u03c8. This control extends to generative model outputs and dataset bias detection. Experiments were conducted on dSprites and ILSVRC datasets, implementing with TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model. The code is available at a specified link. The curr_chunk discusses using a BigGAN model with latent vectors and one-hot vectors to generate images from specific categories. \u03b2-VAEs were also trained to study disentanglement importance. Evaluation focused on position and scale factors on datasets like dSprites. The position of objects in natural images generated by the BigGAN model is estimated using saliency detection to extract the barycenter. Evaluation involves sampling latent codes, generating images, and estimating the factor of variation. Jahanian et al. (2019) proposed an alternative method using an object detector for quantitative evaluation. The proposed approach is more generic and allows for precise control of object position and scale in images. By merging datasets and learning a common direction, it was found that factors of variation are shared between different object categories. Qualitative results are also provided for illustration, showing how latent code is used to encode position and scale in BigGAN images. The latent code in the generator is split into six parts, with spatial factors mainly encoded in the first part. Results on geometric transformations for training and validation datasets are shown, with a note on algorithm limitations at large scales. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on method performance by training \u03b2-VAE on dSprites with varying \u03b2 values. Results showed that controlling object position in images is possible by moving in the latent space along specific directions. Higher \u03b2 values led to better results, allowing for more precise control over image generation. This highlights the importance of disentangled representations for controlling the generative process. The study focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control the generative process. Different types of generative models are discussed, such as GAN-like models and auto-encoders. The method proposed in the study does not require labels and aims to improve reconstruction accuracy without sacrificing sample plausibility. Adding a code to the input of the GAN generator and optimizing with regularization can disentangle the latent space, allowing for meaningful directions to be found. Unlike other approaches focusing on intermediate activations, this method focuses on the latent space. A procedure is proposed to find the latent representation of an image without an encoder, building on previous works that inverted the generator of a GAN to find the latent code of an image. Inverting a generative model involves optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error. Previous methods have struggled with more complex datasets, but a new reconstruction loss improves results significantly. A spherical interpolation reduces blurriness in latent space arithmetic, and a synthetic attribute algorithm generates less blurry images with a VAE. Recent works on finding interpretable directions in the latent space have been released on ArXiv. The curr_chunk discusses a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of the BigGAN model, highlighting differences in training and evaluation procedures compared to previous works. It also explores the impact of disentangled representations on control and proposes an alternative reconstruction error. The curr_chunk discusses a method to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models, specifically BigGAN, for precise control over generated images. It introduces a reconstruction loss based on Fourier transforms to understand the representations learned by the model. The curr_chunk explains the Fourier transform's contribution to the loss in generative models, focusing on high frequency patterns and the impact on image smoothness. It also introduces the \u03b2-VAE framework for latent representation discovery in images. The curr_chunk describes the architecture of a neural network model with convolutional and dense layers, as well as the reconstruction results using different values of \u03c3. It also compares the approach to classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) methods. The curr_chunk discusses the accuracy of reconstruction using a proposed approach compared to MSE and DSSIM methods. Results show that images reconstructed with the new method are perceptually closer to the target image. The optimization problem is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold. Equation 2 is challenging to solve due to the curved trajectories in pixel-space caused by translation, rotation, and scaling transformations. The PCA analysis of image transformations from the dSprites dataset reveals that large translations result in orthogonal paths in pixel-space. This curvature problem is not present in linear transformations like brightness changes. This curvature issue complicates the optimization of the latent code during reconstruction. When the gradient of the error with respect to the latent code is small due to near orthogonality, optimization slows down. In an ideal case with a bijection between latent space and natural images, descent direction near orthogonal to the generative model's manifold can halt optimization. For instance, in a GAN generating a circle, moving it without overlap may result in a gradient of zero, stalling progress. The reconstruction error remains unchanged regardless of the object's position, scale, or brightness. Qualitative examples show images generated with the BigGAN model using different geometric transformations and brightness levels. The latent codes are sampled to control position, scale, and brightness, with some categories showing difficulty in controlling brightness due to training data limitations."
