    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more unsupervised time alone, and are at higher risk of violence during after school hours. The Act sets goals to address these challenges. The goals of the \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" include increasing academic success, improving students' skills, promoting safe environments, preparing for workforce participation, and providing alternatives to negative activities. The Act defines terms like \"school\" and \"Secretary\" and authorizes a program for grants to schools for specified activities. Each school receiving a grant under the \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" must conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training after regular school hours. Optional activities include drug, alcohol, and gang prevention, health counseling, and job skills preparation. Activities must reflect the specific needs of the population served and take place in a designated school building or public facility. The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" requires schools to conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training after regular school hours. Schools are encouraged to collaborate with volunteers, request computer equipment donations, and work with park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. Each school seeking a grant under the Act must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how the goals will be met, collaborative efforts, administration of activities, utilization of existing programs, funding sources, and a plan for non-Federal funding. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002."
