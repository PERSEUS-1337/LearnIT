    "content": "Since the 9/11 attacks, policymakers have been working to reduce the US vulnerability to terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction. This report outlines high-threat chemical agents, their availability, treatment, detection, and policy approaches to mitigate the threat. While the probability of terrorist use of chemical agents is low, the potential consequences are high. There is debate on terrorist groups' interest in chemical acquisition, but the US remains vulnerable to chemical attacks. Policy approaches have generally treated chemical agents collectively, rather than addressing specific agents. Detection capabilities vary between military and civilian sectors, and treatments for chemical exposure must be tailored to the specific chemical involved. High-threat chemical agents, whether developed for commercial use or as weapons, can cause a range of symptoms and injuries to victims. Treatment effectiveness depends on identifying the specific chemical involved and the route of exposure. Limited practical experience in treating chemical casualties exists, especially among civilian healthcare providers. Efforts to reduce vulnerability to terrorist chemical attacks are ongoing, but it remains unclear if the most dangerous agents are adequately addressed. Chemical agents can cause harm through skin contact or inhalation, requiring specific protective equipment. Military planners categorize these agents into nerve, blister, choking, and blood agents. Nerve agents, like organophosphates, are manmade compounds with high toxicity. Tabun or GA was the first nerve agent developed for military use. Production of nerve agents began in the 1930s with Tabun or GA developed in Germany, followed by the G-series including Sarin and Soman. The V-series was later invented in England, with the United States manufacturing VX and the Soviet Union producing V-gas. Nerve agents were rarely used in military conflicts, but Iraq reportedly used them in the Iran-Iraq war. Commercially available equipment could potentially be used to synthesize nerve agents, but the extreme toxicity poses a significant danger to manufacturers. Nerve agents like VX are extremely toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or skin contact. They interfere with the nervous system, causing muscle overstimulation, nausea, weakness, convulsions, and even death. Atropine and pralidoxime chloride are used as antidotes to treat nerve agent exposure. The effects of nerve agent exposure can be treated with drugs like diazepam (Valium) to reduce convulsions and seizures. Treatment window varies depending on the agent, with some agents permanently binding quickly while others allow for treatment up to several hours after exposure. Blister agents cause painful blistering of the skin, requiring full body protection to prevent casualties and reduce combat effectiveness. Blister agents, like mustard agents, are oily liquids that cause painful blistering of the skin, reducing combat effectiveness. Mustard agents were first developed in the late 1800s and were used in World War I, causing the greatest number of chemical casualties. Many countries stockpile blister agents in their chemical weapon inventories, with the United States currently destroying its stockpile. Production of blister agents is considered less complicated than nerve agents, requiring the use of toxic chemicals and specialized equipment. Blister agents can enter the body through the lungs or by contact with the skin or eyes, causing burns and delayed symptoms. Exposure to large amounts of liquid mustard agent may be fatal, with symptoms including reddening of the skin, pain, swelling, blisters, lesions, malaise, vomiting, fever, and potential systemic effects. Exposure to blister agents can be fatal, causing severe eye damage, lung damage, and weakening of the immune system. Treatment involves symptomatically treating skin irritations and respiratory tract injuries, with hospitalization and mechanical ventilation possibly required for severe cases. Special precautions must be taken against opportunistic infections after exposure to high concentrations of mustard agent. Choking agents, such as chlorine, ammonia, and phosgene, are chemicals that can cause breathing difficulties and permanent lung damage. They are dual-use chemicals with civilian and military applications, requiring specialized equipment for production. Choking agents were historically used in warfare, with chlorine gas being the first major chemical attack in World War I. Choking agents cause breathing difficulties and lung damage. Symptoms include chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and tearing eyes. Treatment involves rest, oxygen therapy, and corticosteroids for fluid accumulation in the lungs. Blood agents like hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts interfere with oxygen utilization at the cellular level. Hydrogen cyanide, a volatile gas with an almond smell, was used in chemical warfare and as the active agent in Zyklon B, the gas used in German concentration camps during World War II. It is now used in industrial applications such as chemical, electroplating, and mining industries. Blood agents, like hydrogen cyanide, act through inhalation or ingestion to impair cellular oxygen use, especially affecting the central nervous system. Symptoms range from headache and nausea to convulsions and coma, with high concentrations leading to gasping for breath and cardiac failure. Treatment involves specific antidotes like amyl or sodium nitrite combined with sodium thiosulfate to remove cyanide from the body. Ventilation with oxygen and anticonvulsants may be necessary for severe cases. Protection against chemical agents is primarily achieved through physical means like gas masks and protective clothing. Gas mask filters with activated charcoal are effective against inhaled chemical agents but may not fully protect against agents active on skin contact. Gas mask filters have a limited lifetime based on the amount of activated charcoal remaining. Protective garments like hazardous materials suits made of rubber with activated charcoal provide full protection against most chemical exposures. Medical prophylaxis against chemical weapons is limited, with pyridostigmine bromide offering some protection against the nerve agent Soman. Unlike biological pathogens, there are no vaccines for immunity against chemical weapons. The U.S. Army has developed a chemical-resistant skin cream called SERPACWA to protect against chemical weapons. Decontamination is crucial in removing chemicals from victims to prevent secondary exposure and contamination of treatment facilities. Decontamination is vital for victims exposed to liquid chemical agents, with treatment following decontamination. Chemical weapons detection is a concern for military and civilian responders, with a need for portable instruments to detect all chemical agents. The Department of Defense utilizes various technologies for chemical agent detection. Chemical agents can be detected using various methods such as personal sensors, atmospheric sampling, and field-adapted laboratory techniques. Detection serves to provide warning of an attack, identify the agent used, and determine when an area is clear post-event. Techniques like detection paper, tickets, and tubes are used to sample the environment for chemical agents. Detection paper changes color when exposed to a chemical agent, while detection tickets and tubes rely on air sampling to indicate the presence of agents. Detection of chemical agents can be done using various methods such as personal sensors, atmospheric sampling, and field-adapted laboratory techniques. Detection paper, tickets, and tubes are commonly used for sampling the environment. Handheld detectors like the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) can detect certain agents below lethal levels. Automatic sampling devices like the Automatic Chemical Agent Detector/Alarm (ACADA) provide constant atmospheric sampling using ion mobility spectroscopy. Commercially available equipment can be used by hazardous material response teams to assess potential terrorist activity. The President has requested funding for research on standards for first responder detection equipment. The National Institute of Justice has provided guidelines to assess various types of detectors for first responders. The Metropolitan Medical Response System enhances local capabilities in the event of a terrorist incident. Public health networking has improved information sharing between localities since September 11, 2001. Public health monitoring may aid in forensic investigations. Public health monitoring can aid in forensic investigations following covert events and identify terrorists with chemical weapon injuries. The Laboratory Response Network links diagnostic labs for chemical agent identification. While experts believe using chemical agents as weapons of mass destruction is difficult, they can be effective in enclosed spaces for terror attacks. Few successful chemical terror attacks have occurred, such as the 1995 incident involving the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan. The Aum Shinrikyo cult carried out successful chemical terror attacks in Japan in 1995, using Sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway and in Matsumoto. These attacks resulted in fatalities and injuries, highlighting the lethality of G-series nerve agents. Blister agents, while less lethal, can cause mass terror and injury through dermal exposure. Choking agents are no longer effective due to protective gear. The industrial availability of choking agents like chlorine poses a potential threat as large volumes can be acquired for malicious use. Blood agents, although difficult to use on a mass scale due to quick dispersal and large quantities needed, are of interest to terrorist groups for potential criminal activities. Ramzi Yousef intended to use sodium cyanide in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, but only a small amount was found. Aum Shinrikyo members attempted to use sodium cyanide in an attack in Tokyo, which was successfully disarmed. In 2002, Italian police arrested four men with potassium ferrocyanide, allegedly planning to poison the water supply. A group called September 11 threatened to use cyanide in the America's Cup boat race in New Zealand. Al Qaeda is believed to have produced cyanide for terrorist activities. Al Qaeda has developed plans for using chemical weapons, including hydrogen cyanide. Testimonies reveal training in hydrogen cyanide use at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Videotapes from Afghanistan show testing of unknown chemical agents on dogs, likely hydrogen cyanide. Treaties and agreements aim to control international proliferation of chemical weapons by increasing technical barriers and restricting precursor chemicals. The curr_chunk discusses multilateral controls on weapon production and the regulation of precursor chemicals. It mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention, export controls, and programs like \"Operation Shield America\" to monitor the sale of dual-use chemicals. Some industries are developing best practices programs to limit potential misuse of dual-use equipment, with higher physical security measures in place. For example, the American Chemistry Council requires its members to adhere to its Responsible Care Security Code, which includes prioritizing facilities, assessing security procedures, addressing identified flaws, and conducting security audits. The extent of security preparedness at chemical facilities is unknown, with voluntary measures in place. The extent of security preparedness at chemical facilities is unknown. Federal agencies involved in research on chemical weapons countermeasures include the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. Research areas include biomedical research, detector sensitivity, and understanding chemical releases. The Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate funds research against chemical terrorism. The FY2004 budget request includes funds for developing better technologies for chemical detection and a Standards Program for first responder detection equipment. The United States government conducts defensive research into chemical weapons, focusing on enhancing medical treatments for victims and understanding chemical weapon action. Research is carried out by various agencies including the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop improved detectors for chemical weapons. The Department of Defense is working on the next generation of chemical agent detectors, including the Joint Chemical Agent Detector for individual use. Chemical Agent Detector and ChemLab system are being developed for individual and networked use. Research is ongoing to better understand chemical releases and develop computer programs for modeling contamination. Federal response teams, like the DOD's CBIRF, are prepared for consequence management in the event of chemical terrorism. The CBIRF is a rapid response force located in Maryland that can be deployed domestically or internationally for chemical or biological terror attacks. It has decontamination and treatment facilities and state-of-the-art equipment. The FBI has a Hazardous Materials Response Unit for analyzing and identifying chemicals in crimes involving chemical weapons. The U.S. Army Technical Escort Unit conducts chemical detection and decontamination worldwide. Operational Response Teams, Disaster Medical Assistance Teams, and National Medical Response Teams are available for deployment in national emergencies. These teams are under the Department of Homeland Security and can respond within four hours to incidents involving Weapons of Mass Destruction. Policymakers need to address the threat of terrorist acquisition and use of high-threat chemical agents, including availability, detection technology, first responder capabilities, treatment development, and funding allocation. Some chemicals with commercial or industrial use are available for purchase from chemical suppliers without much oversight, making them susceptible to theft. Regulatory mechanisms like mandatory identity verification for domestic purchases could reduce the threat, but may burden manufacturers and end-users with increased costs. However, increasing acquisition barriers may not address the threat of theft or intentional damage during transport. Some suggest stricter regulation of transport and storage of dual-use chemical agents to mitigate these risks. Some propose stricter regulations for the transport and storage of chemicals to enhance security, including limiting amounts transported or stored in less populated areas. Legislation in the 108th Congress aims to address these issues. Legislation in the 108th Congress addresses the limited availability and strict control of chemical weapons in the United States. Chemical weapon precursors can be purchased domestically from chemical companies with increased verification measures. Manufacturing chemical weapons from unregulated compounds is possible but complex and time-consuming. Research efforts are needed for reliable chemical agent detectors as current monitors are not fully effective. Chemical weapon detectors are not effective in detecting chemical weapons at safe levels, posing challenges for first responders. False positives and negatives are risks, impacting civilian safety. Current use of detectors is case-by-case, mainly in emergencies, to assess hazardous releases and contamination levels. The effectiveness and appropriate use of such equipment are under evaluation, with real-time detection systems being implemented in public transit in Washington, DC. A real-time chemical detection system has been installed in public transit in Washington, DC to detect potential chemical attacks. Information on the system's extent and sensitivity is not publicly available, but it may be expanded to provide greater coverage within the transit system or in other public transit systems. The cost of expanding such a system could be significant. The effectiveness of the current prototype system, including false signals and testing for identifying compounds at low concentrations, is not publicly known. The Environmental Protection Agency has a nationwide air quality detection system that monitors compounds like ozone and pollutants, with added biological agent detection capabilities to identify covert biological weapon releases. A prototype biological detection system is being implemented to test for biological weapons with a multi-day incubation period for infection. In contrast, chemical weapons cause immediate effects, requiring a detect-to-warn system for monitoring ambient air. The system may struggle to detect small releases in enclosed spaces and could be costly to develop and maintain. The cost and challenges of implementing a chemical agent detection system are a concern, including the need for standardized first responder equipment. Some first responder teams feel prepared for a potential chemical attack, while others lack necessary equipment. There is debate over whether equipment purchases should be standardized or left to individual communities based on their specific needs. The Department of Homeland Security's Standards Program will develop criteria for first responder detection equipment. State public health laboratories lack funding and planning for testing environmental samples. The Chemical Terrorism Project offers recommendations to improve public health laboratories' response to chemical terrorism. The federal government may need to ensure validated testing methods for diagnostic laboratories and support for state testing equipment. Private sector research on medications against chemical weapons is limited without federal sponsorship, leading to slow progress in developing new treatments. Some suggest that the government should commit to purchasing successful treatments to incentivize private-sector funding. Some argue for improvements in the public health system rather than investing in unproven treatments. The use of federal response teams is debated, with concerns about redundancy and delays in regional team responses. Suggestions include the need for parallel civilian and military response teams for better preparedness. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various topics related to terrorism, emergency management, food safety, chemical plant security, and proliferation control regimes. The reports cover issues such as chemical, biological, and toxin weapons, first responder initiatives, emergency management funding, export administration, and the Chemical Weapons Convention."
