    "content": "The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" ensures that no law or agency action should diminish the value of privately owned property. Federal agencies must exercise authority to prevent such limitations and property owners have the right to compensation. The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" guarantees compensation for property owners if their property's value is reduced by 20% or more due to agency actions under regulatory laws. If the value diminishes by over 50%, owners can choose to sell that portion to the Federal Government. Once compensated, the property cannot be used against the agency's limitation unless the compensation is refunded with inflation adjustments. SEC. 4. EFFECT OF STATE LAW.\n\nIf a use is a nuisance or prohibited under local zoning, no compensation shall be made under this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNo compensation for agency actions preventing hazards to health, safety, or specific property damage. No compensation for agency actions under the Federal navigation servitude, except for wetlands.\n\nSEC. 6. PROCEDURE. An owner seeking compensation under this Act must make a written request to the agency within 180 days of receiving notice of the agency action. The agency can negotiate the compensation amount with the owner, and if no agreement is reached within 180 days, the owner can choose arbitration or civil action. Arbitration procedures will follow title 9, United States Code, and the agency must promptly pay any award, including attorney's fees and arbitration costs. An owner who does not choose arbitration or receive prompt payment may seek relief through a civil action against the agency. If successful, the agency is liable for attorney's fees, litigation costs, and interest on compensation. Payments and judgments are sourced from the agency's annual appropriation, with the possibility of seeking reimbursement from another agency. The head of the agency can transfer funds if needed for payment or judgments. If funds are insufficient, they must seek appropriations for the next fiscal year. SEC. 7. LIMITATION. Any payment under this Act by the United States is subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 8. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS. Agencies must provide notice to property owners affected by agency actions, explaining their rights and compensation procedures.\n\nSEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit any compensation rights under the Constitution or other U.S. laws. Compensation payment does not grant additional rights to the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 10. DEFINITIONS.
