    "content": "The \"Cost of Higher Education Review Act of 1997\" highlights the significant increase in tuition costs at public colleges and universities, outpacing household income and consumer goods prices. Concerns about college affordability have reached a 30-year high, making college education one of the most expensive investments for American families. The Act establishes the \"National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education\" to address these issues. The \"National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education\" consists of 7 members appointed by various leaders and the Secretary of Education. Each member must have expertise in higher education finance, Federal financial aid programs, education economics research, higher education administration, or business efficiency. The Commission elects a Chairman and Vice Chairperson to lead its efforts. In the absence of the Chairperson, the Vice Chairperson assumes duties. A majority of Commission members constitute a quorum. Appointments must be made within 30 days. If not, designated officers can make appointments on behalf of leaders. Members of the Commission are entitled to one vote each, vacancies do not affect its powers and are filled as per original appointment, no additional pay is given, and initial meeting must occur within 40 days of enactment. SEC. 4. FUNCTIONS OF COMMISSION.
