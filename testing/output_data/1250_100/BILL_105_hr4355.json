The Congress finds that thousands of computer systems are not capable of recognizing dates after December 31, 1999, which could cripple essential systems. Prompt disclosure of Year 2000 readiness information is crucial to minimize disruption to the economy and legal liability concerns exist. The Congress aims to promote the free disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 readiness information to address concerns about legal liability and ensure timely responses to the issue. Uniform legal standards are needed to facilitate the dissemination of such information without hindrance, benefiting both public and private entities in addressing Year 2000 needs efficiently. The Congress aims to promote the free disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 readiness information by establishing uniform legal principles. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

If the statement is a republication, liability exists if made knowingly false or without disclosure. In covered actions regarding Year 2000 statements, liability for a republication exists if the statement is knowingly false or made without disclosure of its source.
