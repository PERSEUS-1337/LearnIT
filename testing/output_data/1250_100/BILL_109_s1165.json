    "content": "The Act is titled the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and have entered into a contract to purchase additional land for habitat protection and management. The land of the estate of James Campbell on the Kahuku Coast features coastal dunes, wetlands, and strand that support diverse wildlife, including endangered Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide more opportunities for wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. Acquisition of the land will create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts and mitigate flood damage. Expanding the Refuge in Kahuku is necessary to reduce flood damage to residences, businesses, and public buildings following heavy rainfall. The Act defines key terms such as Director, Refuge, and Secretary. The expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is addressed. SEC. 4 of the Act expands the boundary of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge by approximately 1,100 acres of land. The Secretary has the authority to make minor boundary revisions to achieve the goals of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The map depicting the expansion will be available for inspection, and notice of its availability will be published. The Secretary may acquire land described in section 4(a) to become part of the Refuge and be administered according to the law. Appropriations are authorized as necessary to implement the Act."
