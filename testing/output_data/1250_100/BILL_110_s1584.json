    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and adds a new section 302 for findings and purposes. The Congress finds the importance of maintaining federal expertise in hydrographic data and services to support a safe marine transportation system. The Nation's marine transportation system is vital for international trade and commerce, but it is becoming increasingly congested. The volume of maritime commerce is expected to double in the next 20 years, with nearly half of the cargo being hazardous substances. Hydrographic data and services also support national needs for emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and coastal resiliency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a key role in establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, with a focus on marine and coastal territorial limits and jurisdiction. Research and development of new technologies are expected to enhance efficiency in this integrated ocean observing system. The Act aims to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, safety, and environmental protection through the use of new technologies. It supports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in providing accurate hydrographic data for international trade, homeland security, emergency response, and marine management. The Act aims to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, safety, and environmental protection through the use of new technologies. It supports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in providing accurate hydrographic data for international trade, homeland security, emergency response, and marine management, including storm surge, tsunami, coastal flooding, erosion, and pollution trajectory monitoring, predictions, and warnings; marine and coastal geographic information systems; habitat restoration; long-term sea-level trends; and more accurate environmental assessments and monitoring. It also promotes improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations through increased coordination and cooperation, research and development in hydrographic data, services, and related technologies, and national and international leadership for hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892) is amended to define hydrographic data and outline the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of information for providing hydrographic services. The term 'Coast and Geodetic Survey Act' refers to the Act approved on August 6, 1947, defining the functions and duties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. SEC. 5. Changes in functions of the Administrator. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and provide hydrographic services. The Administrator has the authority to procure vessels, equipment, and technologies for hydrographic data acquisition and services, operate monitoring systems for navigation safety, provide data for coastal resource management, and respond to emergencies to save lives and protect property. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition. SEC. 6 amends Section 305 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 by changing subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) references. SEC. 7 makes changes to the Hydrographic Services Review Panel. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change references in subsections and modify the composition of the panel. Voting members must be qualified in disciplines related to hydrographic data and services. Amendment to Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 changes references and composition of the panel. Voting members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in performing their duties. Section 307 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize appropriations of $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for carrying out the Act."
