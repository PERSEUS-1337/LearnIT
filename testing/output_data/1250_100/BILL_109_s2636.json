    "content": "The \"Oil Company Accountability Act\" may be cited as the short title. It introduces an Energy Tax Rebate under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Oil Company Accountability Act introduces an Energy Tax Rebate under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Each individual is treated as having made a $500 payment against the tax for the 2006 taxable year. The Secretary will remit the payment to taxpayers within 30 days of enactment. Certain individuals, estates, trusts, and nonresident aliens are not eligible for this payment. The table of sections for subchapter B of chapter 65 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item. Sec. 6430. Energy tax rebate. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. Revaluation of LIFO inventories of large integrated oil companies. The taxpayer, if an applicable integrated oil company for its last taxable year ending in 2005, must increase the value of historic LIFO inventories of petroleum products and decrease the cost of goods sold. The excess amount of increases over cost of goods sold will increase the taxpayer's gross income. The \"layer adjustment amount\" is $18.75 multiplied by the number of barrels of crude oil. The taxpayer, as an applicable integrated oil company, must adjust historic LIFO inventories of petroleum products by increasing the value and decreasing the cost of goods sold. The \"layer adjustment amount\" is calculated based on the number of barrels of crude oil. This adjustment does not constitute a change in accounting method and does not result in additional tax underpayments for estimated tax payments. An applicable integrated oil company must meet specific criteria regarding production and gross receipts to qualify under this section of the Internal Revenue Code. All persons treated as a single employer are considered as one entity, and special rules apply for short taxable years. MODIFICATIONS OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES APPLY TO LARGE INTEGRATED OIL COMPANIES WHO ARE DUAL CAPACITY TAXPAYERS. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. Any amount paid to a foreign country without a generally applicable income tax is not considered a tax. The Internal Revenue Code includes special rules for dual capacity taxpayers, defined as individuals subject to a levy of a foreign country and receiving a specific economic benefit from that country. The term \"generally applicable income tax\" is also defined for this subsection. The term \"generally applicable income tax\" refers to an income tax imposed by a foreign country on income from business activities within that country, excluding certain individuals. A \"large integrated oil company\" is defined as an integrated oil company with gross receipts exceeding a certain threshold. The amendments made by this section apply to large integrated oil companies with gross receipts over $1,000,000,000 and daily worldwide oil production of at least 500,000 barrels. The effective date is for taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act, with exceptions for treaty obligations of the United States."
