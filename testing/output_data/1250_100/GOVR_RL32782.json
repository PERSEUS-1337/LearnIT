    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed the \"Clear Skies\" plan to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide from electric utilities. The plan involved emission caps implemented through a tradeable allowance program in two phases: 2010 and 2018. The proposal was introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, and a modified version was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131. Debate focused on the cap-and-trade implementation scheme, with the EPA stating it would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions at a lower cost than traditional regulations. The Clear Skies proposal includes cap-and-trade provisions to control emissions, particularly for NOx and mercury. It also aims to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected sources opting into the program, with the Administration deeming certain provisions unnecessary. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations under the Clean Air Act for electric generating units and industrial sources by eliminating various provisions such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the structure of the Clean Air Act is examined in this report. The Clean Air Act proposed changes by Clear Skies would mainly affect Title I, with distinctions based on location, facility type, and fuel. Despite additions like the cap-and-trade program in 1990, the Act's basic structure from 1970 remains. It established NAAQS and emission standards to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and required emission limits for new polluting facilities. NAAQS are set for six criteria pollutants to protect public health. States are responsible for implementing the standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs), focusing on reducing emissions to meet NAAQS. Areas not meeting NAAQS must require new sources to use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions increase. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established emission limits for new polluting facilities, including the use of LAER technology to prevent overall emissions increase. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution, with standards for SO2, NOx, and PM10. The Act also addresses interstate pollution through mechanisms like regional commissions. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established emission limits for new polluting facilities, including the use of LAER technology to prevent overall emissions increase. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install RACT. NSPS are imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution. The largest interstate regulatory regime is the NOx SIP Call, controlling NOx emissions from 20 states and the District of Columbia. States are given emission budgets under this program. EPA successfully encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. Major new sources are subject to NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 CAA added Prevention of Significant Deterioration and visibility impairment provisions to the air quality control regimen. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program under the Clean Air Act focuses on controlling ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution levels based on area classification, with stricter controls in Class I areas like national parks. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined by state permitting agencies. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS, but can be more so if needed to avoid violating emission limitations. The regional haze program complements the PSD program by addressing visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas caused by pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 must install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART). The EPA implemented a regional haze program in 1999 with stricter controls on NOx and SO2. Separate from Title I requirements, Section 112 of the Act establishes a federal regulatory program for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like mercury, with MACT standards for major sources. The EPA Administrator determines MACT standards for major pollutant sources, which must be stringent. Additional regulations may be implemented after eight years to address residual risks from HAPs. Electric utilities require an affirmative finding from the EPA before MACT standards are issued. In 2004, the EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program as an alternative to MACT standards for electric generating units. Under current law, states can enforce stricter standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations. Clear Skies proposes changes to current laws, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury. It also removes certain authorities related to mercury emissions from utilities and other industries. Additionally, it modifies provisions such as BART, Section 126, and conformity for several years. The Clear Skies proposal includes establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg, along with changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions and noncompliance penalties. It also removes or limits certain authorities related to major sources, interstate air pollution control petitions, and nonattainment area designations. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg, along with changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions and noncompliance penalties. It also eliminates or limits certain authorities related to major sources, interstate air pollution control petitions, and nonattainment area designations. Key provisions include reduction of noncompliance penalties, preemption of state requirements, elimination of NSR and BART requirements, establishment of a 50 km zone for PSD requirements, extension of deadlines for meeting NAAQS, and moratoriums on ozone nonattainment provisions and conformity requirements. The Clean Air Act proposes a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program for emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases. Phase 1 sets caps for EGUs in 2008 and 2010, while Phase 2 caps take effect in 2018. Allowances are allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors like fuel type. A small pool of allowances is reserved for new units. The Clear Skies proposal would establish stricter emission standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs compared to current NSPS. The standards would be reviewed and potentially revised every eight years. Additionally, non-utility sources would be allowed to opt into the cap-and-trade program. S. 131 allows non-utility sources to opt into the cap-and-trade program by establishing alternative methods for determining allowances based on emissions and output. Units would receive allocations for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions, with exemptions from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in return for opting in. The ClearSkies regulations offer units the option to opt in, exempting them from major source status for 20 years if accepted by the EPA. It also introduces a \"transitional area\" category for areas close to meeting new air quality standards by 2015. The ClearSkies regulations offer units the option to opt in, exempting them from major source status for 20 years if accepted by the EPA. This change extends deadlines for reaching attainment and removes statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. Clear Skies would exempt affected units in nonattainment areas from certain requirements, limiting their ability to impose additional controls. Existing units must show compliance with emission limits within three years. Clear Skies would also revise Section 112 to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, except for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. The Clear Skies proposal would exempt affected units in nonattainment areas from certain requirements and limit their ability to impose additional controls. It would also revise Section 112 to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, except for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. Additionally, the proposal would establish a moratorium on the use of petitions to control interstate air pollution from affected units and impose more stringent requirements for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium. The amendment to Section 126 would prevent the Administrator from requiring submission of SIPs subjecting affected units to Section 126 requirements with an effective date prior to December 31, 2014. The Administrator must consider emissions reductions required for nonattainment areas when reviewing a petition under Section 126. Additionally, the Administrator must ensure that emission reductions from affected units are cost-effective compared to other sources in upwind areas. Clear Skies aims to improve air quality in nonattainment areas by reducing penalties for noncompliance with sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade programs. The bill does not preempt states from enforcing stricter limits than those outlined in the legislation. The Clear Skies bill aims to improve air quality by reducing penalties for noncompliance with sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade programs. States cannot enforce stricter limits than those in the bill. The bill also exempts EGUs from NSR for 20 years but establishes new emission standards for new EGUs. The Clear Skies bill exempts EGUs from NSR for 20 years and eliminates BART requirements for major sources operating between 1962 and 1977. EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold for modifications was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Clear Skies bill exempts affected units from BART requirements for 20 years after enactment. It specifies regulations for Class I and Class II PSD areas, with exemptions for affected units in Class II areas. The Clear Skies bill introduces a new \"transitional\" area classification to replace nonattainment areas for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS. Transitional areas must demonstrate attainment by December 2015 to avoid penalties. If standards are not met by 2017, areas will be designated nonattainment and must implement controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas are exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. Subpart 2 provisions for ozone nonattainment areas would be eliminated. The Air Act outlines specific requirements for areas classified in different ozone nonattainment categories. These requirements include standards for new stationary sources, inspection programs for vehicles, vapor recovery at gas stations, and penalties for emissions. Areas failing to meet the ozone standard may qualify as \"transitional\" under Clear Skies, allowing them to roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. Elimination of Conformity Requirements under the Clean Air Act is also proposed. The proposed Clear Skies legislation aims to reclassify ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" exempting them from conformity requirements until 2018. Changes to Title I would eliminate location as a variable for controlling electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting into the program. Emission limitations and allowance trading under Clear Skies would not be based on the EGU's location or local government restrictions. The proposed Clear Skies legislation would reclassify nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" exempting them from conformity requirements until 2018. Changes to Title I would eliminate location as a variable for controlling EGUs and industrial sources. State and local governments would lose the ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas, and restrictions on allowance trading would prevent them from influencing emissions. Enforcement mechanisms like NSR would be eliminated for EGUs under Clear Skies, limiting states' control over emissions standards. Additionally, state legislation aimed at achieving attainment would create extra allowances that could be sold to upwind utilities, with states unable to prevent the sale or seek relief under a Section 126 petition. The Clear Skies legislation aims to reclassify nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" exempting them from conformity requirements until 2018. It eliminates the need for stronger state and local standards by establishing transitional areas that would not require additional controls if they are projected to meet air quality standards by December 2015. The legislation also aims to protect Class I areas by providing Part C requirements for facilities within 50 km of these areas. Clear Skies' Class I requirement would reduce the disparity between new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. Existing sources would have more generous allocation formulas, giving them an advantage over new facilities in receiving allowances. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Table 4 from Clear Skies outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants for Electric Generating Units (EGUs) under the program. Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards and residual risk standards would no longer apply to new or existing EGUs, making it challenging to address areas with high concentrations of mercury. States setting more stringent standards would not have full control, as allowance trading could still occur. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from EGUs. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under stringent conditions, including a peer-reviewed study on public health concerns. Former Administrator Whitman highlighted the central issue of Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies will not achieve the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines. EPA's analysis shows that some nonattainment areas will need additional controls and time to reach attainment. Clear Skies proposes modest controls on mercury from electric utilities, which could limit state options for achieving NAAQS attainment. The ability for industrial sources to opt into the program would further reduce state control options. The Clear Skies proposal aims to achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act. However, the program's flexibility in allowing sources to use banked allowances can complicate compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
