    "content": "The \"Enterprise Capital Formation Act of 1997\" encourages investments in small business venture capital stock by providing tax incentives for individuals and corporations. This Act amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the exclusion of gain on certain small business stock. The \"Enterprise Capital Formation Act of 1997\" amends section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code to increase the exclusion percentage from 50% to 75% and reduce the holding period from 5 years to 3 years for certain small business stock. Additionally, the exclusion is now available to corporations. The \"Enterprise Capital Formation Act of 1997\" increases the exclusion percentage for small business stock from 50% to 75% and reduces the holding period from 5 years to 3 years. Stock of a member of a parent-subsidiary controlled group is not eligible for the exclusion. The asset limitation for larger businesses eligible for exclusion is raised to $100,000,000. The \"Enterprise Capital Formation Act of 1997\" increases the exclusion percentage for small business stock to 75% and reduces the holding period to 3 years. The asset limitation for larger businesses eligible for exclusion is raised to $100,000,000. Section 1202 is amended to repeal the per-issuer limitation and make other modifications, including extending the holding period to 5 years and exceptions from redemption rules for business purposes. The amendments to section 1202(c) and 1202(e)(3) provide waivers for stock purchases with a business purpose and specify effective dates for the changes. The amendments made by subsections (b), (c), and (e) of this Act apply to qualified stock issued after August 10, 1993, if the taxpayer elects to apply them. Qualified stock is defined as stock held by the taxpayer on the enactment date that would be qualified small business stock if the amendments applied. The election under paragraph (1) treats stock as sold and reacquired at fair market value on the enactment date. Any resulting gain is recognized on that date, while any loss is not allowed for any taxable year. The election must be made as prescribed by the Secretary. The election, once made for any stock, is irrevocable and must be made as prescribed by the Secretary. SEC. 1045 allows for the rollover of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock to another qualified small business stock. The section allows for nonrecognition of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock if certain conditions are met. Eligible gain is only recognized if the amount realized exceeds the cost of stock purchased within a 60-day period. Definitions and special rules apply, including the definition of qualified small business stock and eligible gain. The tax code allows for nonrecognition of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock under certain conditions. Gain from the sale is used to reduce the basis of any replacement stock purchased within a 60-day period. Special rules apply, including the treatment of replacement stock and the tacking of holding periods for deferral purposes. For purposes of applying this section, gain from disposing of replacement qualified small business stock before holding it for more than 3 years is treated as eligible gain. Replacement qualified small business stock refers to qualified small business stock with reduced basis under subsection (b)(4). Conforming amendments include changes to section 1016(a)(23) and additions to the table of sections for part III of subchapter O of chapter 1. Sec. 1045 allows for the rollover of gain from qualified small business stock to another qualified small business stock. The amendments apply to stock sold or exchanged after the enactment of the Act."
