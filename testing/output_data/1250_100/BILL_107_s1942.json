    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002\" is also known as the Act. It provides incentives for the use of biodiesel as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 introduces the biodiesel fuels credit under section 38, which is determined by the biodiesel mixture credit. The biodiesel mixture credit is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures and the number of gallons of the mixture. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined by the biodiesel mixture credit, which applies to a mixture of diesel and biodiesel sold or used as fuel in a trade or business. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for this credit. Coordination with the exemption from excise tax is also considered. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is reduced to account for benefits from section 4041(n) or 4081(f). Biodiesel is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from various vegetable oils for use in diesel engines. The curr_chunk discusses the registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act and the ASTM D6751 requirements for biodiesel. It also imposes a tax on individuals who separate biodiesel from a mixture or use the mixture for non-fuel purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the tax imposed on biodiesel mixtures based on the applicable rate and volume, with provisions for estates and trusts. Taxpayers can elect to opt out of the biodiesel fuels credit for a taxable year. The curr_chunk discusses the election process for opting out of the biodiesel fuels credit for a taxable year, with specific regulations outlined by the Secretary. The section does not apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2012, and includes amendments to the general business credit and restrictions on carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit before January 1, 2003. The curr_chunk amends various sections of the tax code related to the biodiesel fuels credit, allowing for carryback of the credit to years before 2003 and updating references to the credit in different sections. The curr_chunk amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002. The amendment adds a new subsection for biodiesel mixtures, allowing for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures. The curr_chunk introduces a reduced tax rate for biodiesel mixtures, with specific calculations for determining the amount. Definitions and rules from section 40A also apply to this subsection. Conforming amendments are made to Section 4041 of the Internal Revenue Code. The curr_chunk introduces reduced tax rates for biodiesel mixtures, with specific calculations based on section 40A definitions. Amendments are made to Section 6427 of the Internal Revenue Code to accommodate these changes. The amendments made by this subsection apply to fuel sold between December 31, 2002, and January 1, 2013. Transfers from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Highway Trust Fund will offset reductions in fund receipts due to these changes, based on Treasury estimates. Adjustments will be made for any errors in the estimates."
