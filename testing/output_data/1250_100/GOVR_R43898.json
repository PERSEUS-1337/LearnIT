    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring tax provisions and made some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions through 2014, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. Many temporary tax provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" have been extended multiple times by Congress. The debate in the 114th Congress focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. Some provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, there are still tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016, prompting further debate. The report provides an overview of tax extenders, with specific provisions detailed in other CRS reports. The PATH Act in P.L. 114-113 made expired tax provisions permanent or temporarily extended them. The PATH Act in P.L. 114-113 made several tax provisions permanent, including enhanced tax credits and a moratorium on certain taxes. Additionally, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year. Other legislation proposed further extensions and permanent changes to tax provisions. In the 113th and 114th Congress, various tax reform legislation was introduced to make certain provisions permanent, including research and experimentation tax credits and increased expensing allowances for businesses. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 for two years. The tax code contains numerous temporary tax provisions that are often extended by Congress in a \"tax extender\" package. These provisions are typically extended for short periods to evaluate their effectiveness or provide relief during economic downturns or disasters. Temporary provisions may also be enacted for budgetary reasons. Congress may enact temporary tax provisions for budgetary reasons. The rationale for temporary provisions is to evaluate effectiveness before extension, but this is often undermined by regular extensions without review. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler suggested that expiration dates force policymakers to consider costs and benefits, but in practice, there is no systematic review. Instead, extenders are passed as a package without careful analysis. Tax provisions are typically passed as a package of temporary benefits, with some exceptions like ethanol fuel incentives not extended beyond 2011. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not outweigh the costs. Tax policy can address economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures like bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Other temporary provisions include mortgage forgiveness exclusion from taxable income. The special economic circumstances involve temporary tax provisions like mortgage forgiveness exclusion and payroll tax cuts. Congress may enact temporary tax policies for budgetary reasons, as it is easier to offset short-term extensions. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, leading to potential overestimation of revenues if provisions are routinely extended. Making tax provisions temporary strengthens the long-term revenue outlook. Temporary tax provisions, known as extenders, influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating extenders involves considering their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity. They can provide subsidies to encourage certain activities, but may not always align with economic objectives. Market failures may justify tax distortions for improved economic efficiency. Tax extenders can impact economic welfare by addressing market failures and improving economic efficiency. They are effective if they stimulate desired activities better than direct subsidies. However, direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting resources. Tax fairness is important, with extenders potentially leading to unequal tax burdens for individuals engaging in subsidized activities. This can deviate from horizontal equity standards, where people in equal positions should be treated equally. Vertical equity also plays a role in fair tax distribution among individuals with different abilities to pay. Tax extenders can impact economic welfare by addressing market failures and improving economic efficiency. They are effective if they stimulate desired activities better than direct subsidies. However, direct spending programs may be more successful at targeting resources. Tax fairness is important, with extenders potentially leading to unequal tax burdens for individuals engaging in subsidized activities. This can deviate from horizontal equity standards, where people in equal positions should be treated equally. Vertical equity also plays a role in fair tax distribution among individuals with different abilities to pay. The disproportionate benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system, which is often viewed as a reduction in equity. Extenders contribute to the complexity of the tax code and raise the cost of distribution. Tax extenders increase tax code complexity and administration costs for both the government and individual taxpayers. Many temporary tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, categorized into individual, business, charitable, or energy sectors. The extension costs are included in the legislation. Individual tax extender provisions that expired in 2014 had been previously extended. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses and other individual provisions were extended in tax legislation. Business provisions that expired in 2014 had also been extended previously. The rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) allocation limitation, and active financing exception under Subpart F expired at the end of 2014. New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances also expired in 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, while others were extended through 2019 or 2016. Four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019 with a phase-down starting in 2017. Various energy-related tax provisions were first enacted in 2005 and extended through 2016. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. Congress has regularly acted to temporarily extend expired or expiring tax provisions, and certain provisions were made permanent in the same legislation. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 made certain provisions permanent, increasing the cost compared to other proposals. The total estimated cost of these extensions is $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $426.8 billion attributed to specific provisions. Permanent extensions account for $559.5 billion, with $361.4 billion associated with provisions made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is $361.4 billion, with a small portion of $17.7 billion for a two-year extension of provisions. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to extend expired tax provisions, estimating a cost of $86.6 billion over 10 years with macroeconomic effects included. The cost estimate for extending certain expired business-related provisions, as proposed in S. 1946, is $86.6 billion over 10 years. Including macroeconomic effects is expected to boost economic growth in the near term, resulting in a lower cost estimate. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides estimated costs for extending all tax provisions scheduled to expire before 2025. According to CBO's estimates, extending expiring tax provisions would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over 2016-2025. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to tax credits. Most of the provisions set to expire had already expired by 2014. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual levels due to assumed expiration of tax extenders. Short-term extensions in \"tax extenders\" legislation have lower costs. The cost of providing short-term extensions for expiring tax provisions is lower than extending them through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact. JCT scores reflect the temporary extension's impact relative to current law. Short-term costs of extensions may be higher than long-term costs, as seen with bonus depreciation. For example, a one-year extension in 2014 cost $1.2 billion over 10 years, but had a revenue loss of $45.3 billion in 2015. The cost of bonus depreciation was $45.3 billion, with much of the cost recovered in later years. Bonus depreciation was extended through 2019 at a cost of $11.3 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Legislation in the 114th Congress made certain tax provisions permanent and temporarily extended others. During the 113th Congress, legislation was considered to make certain expired tax provisions permanent. In the 114th Congress, the Senate Finance Committee reported a bill to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016. The House passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179. Additionally, three expired charitable provisions were part of the America Gives More Act of 2015. During the 114th Congress, legislation was passed in the House to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. This included proposals for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) for charitable purposes and contributions of capital gain real property for conservation purposes. Additionally, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 aimed to modify and make permanent the research tax credit. During the 113th Congress, legislation was considered to extend expiring tax provisions, with the House passing bills to make certain provisions permanent. This included proposals in the Jobs for America Act and the America Gives More Act, costing an estimated $511.4 billion over 10 years. Additionally, the Ways and Means Committee reported legislation to make two international-related extender provisions permanent. During the 113th Congress, legislation was considered to extend expiring tax provisions, with the House passing bills to make certain provisions permanent. However, several provisions that had expired at the end of 2013 were not extended as part of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295). Two provisions, the health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles, were not included in P.L. 113-295 but have since been extended in subsequent legislation. In recent years, incentives for alternative technology vehicles have been available, with current incentives for plug-in electric vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016. However, other incentives such as the credit for energy efficient appliances and certain disaster-related provisions were not extended."
