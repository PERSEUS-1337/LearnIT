    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT.\" The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the Great Plains region by providing for reciprocal aid in fighting forest fires among member states including South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. ARTICLE III states that the state forester or equivalent officer in charge of forest fire control can act as the compact administrator for their state, coordinating with officials from other member states to prevent and control forest fires. ARTICLE IV allows member states to request aid from each other's forest fire control agencies in combating fires. \"If member states provide outside aid under this compact, employees have same powers, duties, and immunities as if they were in their own state. No liability for acts or equipment maintenance, except as provided. Requesting state assumes liability. Receiving state must reimburse for any losses or expenses incurred during aid operation.\" The compact ensures that member states are reimbursed for any losses or expenses incurred during aid operations. Workers compensation benefits must be provided to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries within the forest fire fighting forces. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with state laws. \"ARTICLE VI of the compact states that ratification does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fire fighting forces or equipment. Each state must maintain adequate resources for fire protection as if the compact were not in place. States retain the power to enact laws for fire prevention and control. ARTICLE VII ensures that member states are reimbursed for aid operations and provides workers compensation benefits to all involved personnel.\" \"ARTICLE VII states that representatives of the United States Forest Service can attend meetings of the compact administrators. ARTICLE VIII allows for reciprocal aid in combating forest fires between states party to the compact or other regional compacts. ARTICLE IX specifies that the compact remains in force until a state takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period.\""
