    "content": "Climate change has received significant policy attention internationally and in the United States. A 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted evidence of climate warming, raising concerns about potential severe and rapid consequences for humans and ecosystems. The National Academies emphasize that addressing climate change requires a combination of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide being the primary gas emitted through natural and human activities. Adaptation focuses on improving individuals' and institutions' ability to cope with and benefit from climate change impacts. Geoengineering technologies are proposed as an additional method to mitigate climate change by deliberately modifying the Earth's energy balance to reduce temperatures. This raises environmental and ethical concerns, but some argue that further scientific examination is needed to address uncertainties. Proposed technologies vary in their characteristics and consequences, with two main groups: Solar radiation management (SRM) methods aim to increase Earth's reflectivity, or albedo. Geoengineering technologies include Solar Radiation Management (SRM) methods to increase Earth's reflectivity and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. SRM methods could have immediate climate impacts, but if they fail, global warming could resume rapidly. CDR methods involve practices like afforestation and ocean fertilization. Prior to 2013, the UNFCCC and IPCC had not officially mentioned geoengineering in their negotiation texts or reports. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013 addressed geoengineering for the first time, highlighting the potential impacts of Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods. Limited evidence hinders a comprehensive assessment of their impact on the climate system. CDR methods have limitations on a global scale, while SRM methods could offset global temperature rise but may not reduce ocean acidification. Terminating SRM abruptly could lead to a rapid increase in global surface temperatures. Geoengineering methods like CDR and SRM have long-term consequences on a global scale. Despite some foreign governments and scientists considering research or deployment, the US Congress has not taken legislative action on geoengineering. Congressional interest stems from concerns over slow progress in emissions reductions, climate uncertainties, and the potential impact of aggressive GHG mitigation strategies. The report discusses the policy issues, science, and governance of geoengineering technologies, focusing on concerns related to government support, oversight, and potential transboundary effects. It also highlights a case in 2012 where an American citizen conducted a geoengineering experiment that raised international concerns. The report outlines policy parameters, describes technologies, and discusses governmental involvement and oversight mechanisms. Geoengineering technologies aim to modify the Earth's energy balance to counteract climate change. Implementation may vary from local to global levels, with limited research and minimal deployment. More research is needed to assess feasibility, effectiveness, costs, and potential risks before widespread deployment. Some policymakers advocate for governmental oversight due to uncertainties and risks associated with geoengineering. Some policymakers are considering governmental oversight for geoengineering research and deployment. Governance structures could either support or constrain geoengineering activities based on policymakers' decisions. Questions remain about risk factors, policy considerations, and the form of government oversight for geoengineering. The risk of geoengineering activities lies in uncertainties of the new technology, particularly in social, ethical, legal, and political aspects. Government oversight is crucial before promoting geoengineering technologies. Uncertainty hinders the maturity of effective, affordable, safe, and timely methods for deployment. Key risks include the Technology Control Dilemma, where risks can only be resolved through research and development. Geoengineering technologies require appropriate safeguards during development to anticipate potential risks. Flexibility is needed to support research and mitigate harmful deployment. Reversibility is crucial for risk mitigation, allowing for the quick cessation of adverse effects. However, secondary effects may persist after abandonment, impacting social, economic, and technological choices in climate science. Advancing geoengineering options instead of reducing GHG emissions could have adverse effects like ocean acidification, biodiversity stress, and climate shocks. Financial investment in geoengineering infrastructure may hinder research reversal. Encapsulation of technology impacts risk mitigation, with non-encapsulated technologies posing uncertainties and policy challenges. Encapsulated technologies may still have localized environmental impacts. The need for regulatory action may arise from indirect impacts on agro-forestry, species, and habitat as well as direct impacts on ecosystems. Commercial involvement in geoengineering could lead to innovation but may neglect risk assessments. Public subsidies and GHG emission pricing may be needed to encourage private-sector engagement. Public engagement is crucial for the future of geoengineering technologies, as public attitudes, perceptions of risks, trust levels, transparency, liabilities, and compensation all play a significant role in the political feasibility of these technologies. A wider dialogue between scientists, policymakers, and the public is necessary for public acceptance. The acceptance of geoengineering activities will depend on scientific, technical, social, legal, and political factors that vary across countries and cultures. Public engagement is crucial for the future of geoengineering technologies, as public attitudes, perceptions of risks, trust levels, transparency, liabilities, and compensation all play a significant role in the political feasibility of these technologies. A 2009 report by the United Kingdom's Royal Society broadly identified three categories of perspectives within the scientific community about the deployment of geoengineering technologies. These perspectives include viewing geoengineering as a dangerous manipulation of Earth systems and therefore intrinsically unethical, as strictly an insurance policy against major mitigation failure, or as a way to buy back time lost during international mitigation negotiations. Geoengineering technologies aim to mitigate climate change by removing CO2 from the atmosphere (CDR) or increasing the Earth's reflectivity (SRM). These technologies vary in complexity and funding requirements, with most still in the theoretical or research phase. Despite the potential benefits, they currently lack political, scientific, and public support. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods aim to cool the planet by removing CO2 from the atmosphere through biological, physical, or chemical means such as afforestation, ocean fertilization, and carbon capture and storage. While CDR techniques could eventually lower CO2 levels and decrease temperatures, they take longer to impact climate change compared to Solar Radiation Management (SRM) techniques. CDR methods are more easily governed by existing laws but are not ideal for immediate climate alteration. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) method that involves capturing and storing CO2 to prevent its release into the atmosphere. CCS technologies are pursued for biomass, bioenergy, and fossil fuel sources, with biomass and bioenergy sources often labeled as geoengineering technologies. The distinction in labeling CCS as geoengineering depends on the carbon source rather than its outcome of reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies focus on capturing CO2 from biomass and bioenergy sources, which are considered carbon-neutral or carbon-negative. Biomass can be buried or pyrolyzed into biochar to sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years. Large-scale CCS using biomass requires a steady supply and storage location. CCS technology for fossil fuels for permanent sequestration is not yet commercially deployed. The commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for fossil fuels for permanent sequestration has been hindered by costs and regulatory requirements. The EPA's 2013 rule to limit CO2 emissions from new power plants may change incentives for incorporating CCS. While CO2 has been captured on a small scale for commercial applications, large-scale sequestration for long-term climate change mitigation is not yet widespread. Estimates suggest it may take 10-15 years before CCS for fossil fuels is ready for commercial deployment. Additionally, bioenergy generation coupled with CCS (BECS) could sequester carbon through biomass crop planting, harvesting for biofuel production, and capturing and storing released carbon. BECS is an unproven carbon dioxide removal method that involves capturing and storing CO2 released during biomass energy generation. Deployment of BECS may take as long as fossil-fuel CCS due to regulatory challenges and the lack of a framework for geologic sequestration. Some argue that BECS may not be deployed quickly enough to significantly impact climate change. An integrated structure is needed to deploy CCS at a large scale, whether for fossil fuels or bioenergy, including addressing ownership of sequestered CO2 and liability for potential leakage. The sequestration of CO2 involves defining leakage, liability, monitoring, maintenance, and pipeline infrastructure. CCS implementation may reduce motivation to cut fossil fuel use, while BECS could be seen as \"carbon-negative.\" Concerns include contamination of drinking water from CO2 storage. The EPA has set rules for geologic sequestration. Ocean fertilization speeds up carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. Ocean fertilization involves adding iron to certain parts of the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth, which can photosynthesize CO2 and sequester carbon in the deep ocean. Studies suggest that this method could remove significant amounts of carbon from the air, but the ecological, economic, and climatological impacts are uncertain. Some believe it could enhance fish stocks and cool the atmosphere, while others are concerned about ocean acidification and greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that ocean fertilization is not an effective long-term solution for combating climate change. Further research is needed to determine its effectiveness as a carbon sequestration strategy. Ocean fertilization involves adding iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth for carbon sequestration. Questions remain about its effectiveness, impact on marine ecosystems, and legal frameworks for carbon credits. Afforestation is planting trees for carbon sequestration, seen as a prime strategy due to high carbon storage capacity. Afforestation is a strategy with numerous benefits, including carbon storage, erosion control, wildlife habitat, and climate modification. Challenges include measuring carbon storage, landowner reluctance, and potential ecological impacts. Drawbacks to wide-scale implementation include CO2 releases from forested lands, changes in land management, high costs, and effects on crop production. Afforestation is a recognized project under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, with the potential to sequester 2.2 to 9.5 metric tons of CO2 per acre per year. It may take 20 years to see the full carbon sequestration benefits, with carbon accumulation varying based on tree growth. Afforestation projects often occur on marginal croplands, and climate changes may impact the types of forestry species planted. By 2050, an estimated 60-65 million acres of U.S. agricultural land could be converted to woodlands, including 35-50 million acres of cropland. The cost of an afforestation project can vary from $65 to $200 per acre due to land use and terrain. Enhanced weathering could remove CO2 by expediting the weathering process of rocks. One proposed method involves spreading crushed olivine on lands to sequester CO2 and improve soil quality, but further research is needed to assess its benefits and drawbacks. Further research is needed to assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of enhanced weathering technology, including barriers such as scale, cost, energy requirements, and environmental consequences. Solar radiation management methods aim to reduce solar radiation by enhancing Earth's reflectivity through various techniques. These methods, which do not affect greenhouse gas emissions, could be deployed faster than carbon dioxide removal methods if the need to cool the planet quickly arises. Solar radiation management (SRM) methods are considered faster than carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods for quickly cooling the planet. SRM techniques are described as cheap, fast, and imperfect, but have not been proven on any scale. There are calls for research and oversight programs, potentially with international cooperation, to examine SRM technologies before any hasty deployment, as there are concerns about potential system failures, changes in regional climates, and ozone depletion risks associated with these techniques. SRM techniques like sulfate aerosol injection may cause ozone depletion, allowing harmful UVB rays to reach Earth. These techniques in the stratosphere or space can extend the atmospheric lifetime of potent non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Societies may invest less in permanent GHG reduction solutions if they rely on SRM for quick relief. Concerns about unknown effects of large-scale geoengineering exist. Some widely discussed SRM techniques include enhanced albedo, aerosol injection, and space-based reflectors. Increasing surface reflectivity can limit temperature increases by directing more solar radiation back toward space. Enhanced albedo methods, such as painting roofs and paved areas white, are being investigated for urban areas to limit temperature increases by reflecting solar radiation back toward space. While these methods can save on energy costs, drawbacks include uncomfortable glare, aesthetic concerns, and potential decline in asphalt use. Additional techniques for enhancing surface albedo are also being considered. Genetic engineering of plants and covering oceans with reflective surfaces are proposed methods to enhance surface albedo. Cloud whitening, involving the dispersion of cloud-condensation nuclei in desired areas, is another suggested approach. Satellites could be used to measure cloud albedo and determine cooling needs. The long-term implications of cloud whitening are not fully understood. The implications of deploying cloud whitening are not fully understood, with potential disturbances to marine ecosystems. Further research is needed for spray generator development and to assess impacts on ocean currents and precipitation patterns. Aerosol injection involves dispersing aerosols into the stratosphere to cool the Earth, mimicking volcanic eruptions. The cost for sulfur particle injection using airplanes is estimated to be several billion dollars annually, but testing is needed to validate theoretical predictions. Aerosol injection mimics volcanic eruptions like Mount Pinatubo in 1991, reducing global temperatures unevenly. It would need to be repeated over decades to counteract greenhouse gas effects. Benefits include ice melting reversal, but risks include drought, GHG emissions from transportation, ozone depletion, and impacts on solar power and astronomy. Space-based reflectors are a theoretical geoengineering proposal to reduce solar radiation. They would vary in effectiveness based on design, material, location, quantity, and maintenance. Shield materials include lunar glass, aluminum netting, metallic disks, and refracting disks. Deployment considerations include costs, transportation, maintenance, disposal, and ecological impacts. Questions remain about global vs. regional deployment, maturity of the science, and construction timelines. Constructing and deploying a shield to reverse global warming may take decades and cost trillions of dollars. The decision to pursue geoengineering research and deployment is influenced by various factors, including social, legal, political, and scientific considerations. Governments may choose to oversee geoengineering activities with the status quo approach, which involves modest funding, limited regulation, and lack of comprehensive oversight. Advocates of maintaining the current status quo in geoengineering research believe that private industry and commercial development are best suited to determine the merits of such activities. They argue that the commercial sector promotes innovation and that existing regulations for greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient to drive market development in climate engineering. They also emphasize that current research in related fields can pave the way for technological advancements, and that excessive government intervention may hinder progress in this emerging science. Those against governmental support of geoengineering argue that it may endorse a technology some view as harmful. Public opinion and cost concerns may deter further support. Governments endorsing the status quo may face arguments for abstention. Policymakers may consider creating a system for government oversight of geoengineering research and deployment. The question of when governments should intervene to regulate geoengineering activities will be crucial in determining oversight. Determining oversight for geoengineering activities involves identifying potential harms and setting thresholds for regulation. Criteria for oversight include the international scope of impacts, introduction of hazardous materials, ecosystem intervention, and the perturbation, reversibility, and duration of activities. Suggestions include establishing an international panel process for scientific and political assessment. The oversight of geoengineering activities involves evaluating research and deployment similar to the National Environmental Policy Act. Different policies may be needed to address concerns about the new and uncertain technology, including impacts on stakeholders and the environment. The oversight of geoengineering activities involves evaluating research and deployment similar to the National Environmental Policy Act. Different technologies, stakeholders, and global impacts may require varying methods of oversight. CDR technologies may be governed by existing U.S. laws, while air capture technologies are akin to carbon capture and sequestration. Biochar and biomass sequestration face similar regulatory challenges. Geoengineering technologies, including biochar, biomass sequestration, enhanced weathering, and ocean fertilization, may have significant cross-border effects. Regulatory frameworks need to be flexible to cover the full research and deployment cycle, as different stages may require varying oversight methods. Existing treaties addressing atmosphere and space may not fully encompass the complexities of geoengineering governance. Regulatory frameworks for geoengineering must be flexible to cover the full cycle of research and deployment, with varying oversight needed at different stages. Different environments may require different methods of oversight, and international regulations are necessary for areas like the high seas and outer space. Negative social and economic consequences could arise as early as small-scale field trials, highlighting the importance of effective governance throughout the process. Geoengineering research and deployment may require international cooperation for effective regulation. Some advocate for a moratorium or ban due to uncertain science, potential uneven impacts, distraction from mitigation goals, and misuse by governments or industry. However, others argue against such restrictions, stating they could hinder ongoing research and innovation in fields like marine ecology. Geoengineering activities may inhibit research in marine ecology and atmospheric meteorology, making it difficult to gather necessary information for informed judgments. Current legal frameworks are unclear in regulating geoengineering, leading to debates on government oversight and the need for new legal frameworks to support coordinated research and enforce normative standards. The implementation of frameworks at local, national, or international levels is still under discussion. The governance of geoengineering activities is uncertain, with debates over oversight at different levels. Three approaches are discussed: sub-national, national, and international oversight. In the United States, states may develop their own policies, but a comprehensive federal policy may be needed due to potential impacts across boundaries. The diversity of state policies may pose challenges for private actors operating under varying laws. Efforts by the U.S. government to develop policies addressing emerging technologies like geoengineering indicate best practices for effective policy development. Private sector involvement in geoengineering is limited due to uncertainty, lack of carbon pricing incentives, and uncertainty over commercial use beyond government deployment. Emerging technologies like geoengineering may require initial public subsidies for development, with existing federal subsidies in the US for technologies such as carbon sequestration and renewable energy. Regulatory concerns exist due to potential hazards and unintended consequences, leading to the need for constraints or bans similar to those for hazardous materials. While no specific federal law covers geoengineering activities, existing legal instruments may apply depending on the activity type, location, and sponsor. The federal government could expand current laws or develop new ones to address geoengineering activities. Existing federal laws could be expanded or new laws developed to address geoengineering activities. Administrative agencies could interpret their authority to authorize rules for specific geoengineering activities. Some activities like subterranean carbon dioxide sequestration and ocean fertilization may already be affected by federal laws such as the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act. The EPA has issued draft rules regulating CO2 injection and greenhouse gas emissions from carbon dioxide injection and geologic sequestration. The 111th Congress considered amending the Clean Air Act to broaden the EPA's authority in this area. The curr_chunk discusses the implications of ocean fertilization and stratospheric aerosol injection on existing federal laws, such as the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments. The MPRSA prohibits unpermitted ocean dumping and authorizes research on ocean resources, while the Clean Air Act Amendments require the EPA to adjust phase-out schedules for ozone-depleting substances. The EPA is required to add substances with an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0.2 or greater to Class 1 and set a phase-out schedule within seven years. States are developing their own policies for geoengineering. Federal agencies have not dedicated significant efforts or funding to national geoengineering policies. The potential roles for federal entities in developing and implementing national geoengineering policies include conducting research, facilitating information exchange, funding activities, monitoring projects, promulgating regulations, and enforcing regulations. Policymakers should consider involving multiple agencies with different expertise and legislative authorities to expand or constrict jurisdiction as needed. Table 2 lists agencies and entities with legislative authority for various geoengineering functions. No single federal entity is authorized for all geoengineering technologies. International agreements could establish norms, enforcement mechanisms, and transparency for global cooperation on geoengineering. The strengths and weaknesses of international treaties lie in their conservative nature, where nations adjust commitments to ensure compliance. Developing international consensus on norms and commitments can be challenging due to cultural, political, and economic diversity, leading to time-intensive processes and potential stalemates. Some suggest that countries may only agree to a moratorium on geoengineering research and deployment due to these obstacles. Incentives for geoengineering may hinder international cooperation due to difficulties in monitoring and enforcing agreements. Dispute settlement systems in international agreements may not effectively address disputes between private actors. Local and national laws may still be necessary to regulate geoengineering activities. Local and national laws may still be necessary to regulate geoengineering activities, as no multilateral treaty has been proposed to address all aspects of geoengineering. Customary international law and existing agreements may be relevant to geoengineering projects, with governments potentially using these principles to develop a comprehensive international approach. Under customary international law, countries have a duty not to cause significant transboundary harm, which could be relevant to geoengineering projects. Customary international law also influences the legal significance of international agreements, such as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that signatories must not act in a way that defeats the purpose of the agreement. Under customary international law, countries have a duty not to cause significant transboundary harm. The obligations arising from treaties and international agreements should be interpreted in light of these principles. The international agreements on climate change, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are important for geoengineering projects as they encourage parties to implement policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these agreements do not explicitly address geoengineering. The Kyoto Protocol, opened for signature in 1997 and in force since 2005, requires high-income parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Convention on Biological Diversity, opened for signature in 1992, emphasizes countries' right to exploit resources responsibly. The United States has signed but not ratified both agreements. The 10th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD adopted provisions in October 2010 calling for parties to abstain from geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity unless risks and impacts are fully considered. The COP also affirmed earlier decisions regarding ocean fertilization and requested that activities do not take place without adequate scientific justification. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) may also be relevant to the use of CDR technologies. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was opened for signature in December 1982 and entered into force on November 16, 1994. Despite not being a party to UNCLOS, the United States views many of its provisions as customary international law. UNCLOS governs activities on, over, and under the world's oceans, including defining countries' jurisdictions and rights of access to ocean resources. Article 194 of UNCLOS requires parties to prevent, reduce, and control pollution of the marine environment. This provision is relevant for geoengineering projects that could pollute the marine environment. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs activities on, over, and under the world's oceans. Article 194 mandates countries to prevent pollution of the marine environment. Geoengineering projects that pollute the ocean could trigger UNCLOS provisions, including Article 192 on protecting the marine environment. The London Convention and London Protocol regulate marine pollution and dumping of wastes. The United States is a party to the London Convention but not to UNCLOS. The United States is a party to the London Convention, which aims to prevent sea pollution by dumping harmful substances. However, the US has not joined the London Protocol. Geoengineering projects involving deliberate disposal of substances into the sea may not violate the Convention if done for a different purpose. Amendments to the London Protocol in 2006 provide guidance on carbon dioxide dumping, specifying conditions for sub-seabed geological sequestration. The parties adopted Resolution LC-LP.1 in 2008, agreeing that ocean fertilization research activities do not constitute dumping under the London Convention and Protocol. The use of SRM technologies may implicate the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD), which aims to prohibit the military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques with severe effects. The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) aims to limit and reduce air pollutants to combat transboundary pollution. Parties to the Convention are encouraged to exchange scientific and technological information on environmental modification techniques for peaceful purposes. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, along with the Montreal Protocol, aims to control ozone-depleting substances. The United States is a party to both agreements and is expected to cooperate to understand the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol aim to control ozone-depleting substances. International cooperation is needed to address the modification of the ozone layer, including potential risks from geoengineering technologies. There is a debate over the ideal structure of an international institution to oversee these activities. The ideal structure of an international institution for overseeing geoengineering activities is debated. Factors to consider include functions, membership inclusiveness, resources, subject-area jurisdiction, and voting rules. Some suggest a multilateral body like the United Nations or a specialized agency within it, such as UNEP or the International Maritime Organization, is best suited for addressing global geoengineering activities. Some argue that involving an international institution like the United Nations for overseeing geoengineering activities has advantages such as global reach, access to resources, legitimacy, and experience in consensus-building. However, the U.N. process is slow and may not provide a rapid response to geoengineering. Critics fear mission creep and conflicts of interest if geoengineering is integrated into a pre-existing institution. International organizations involved in geoengineering include plurilateral or ad hoc bodies like the G-20 or Major Economies Forum, which may coordinate research agendas. However, their limited membership could undermine legitimacy and exclude countries from formulating responses. Mission creep and conflict of interest issues may also arise. The International Energy Association (IEA) coordinates government measures for energy security, economic development, and environmental protection, including carbon capture and sequestration projects. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops international standards in response to sector needs. ISO members have public review procedures for transparency. The ISO develops international standards with public review procedures for transparency. To become an ISO International Standard, a draft must be approved by at least two-thirds of ISO national members. The ISO has not yet developed comprehensive standards for geoengineering but has created standards for air quality, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions. International research consortia play a role in setting research priorities, evaluating emerging technologies, and collaborating with various communities for oversight. The international community can establish independent oversight for emerging technologies like geoengineering through collaborative consortia. These consortia can involve experts and stakeholders to develop a voluntary code of practice, ensuring transparency and guidance in research. By building a community of responsible researchers, international policy norms on geoengineering can be developed from the bottom up, with interactive links between governance and scientific research. Currently, there is no collaborative mechanism applicable to geoengineering, unlike other scientific collaborations with potentially hazardous side effects. International bodies overseeing geoengineering may lack full regulatory authority, relying on member cooperation for compliance. For instance, the International Court of Justice handles disputes but relies on UN Security Council for enforcement if a party fails to comply with judgments. The International Court of Justice and the World Trade Organization have dispute settlement processes for non-compliance with agreements. However, enforcement ultimately relies on international negotiations and diplomacy. Geoengineering, an emerging field, may require the development or amendment of international agreements or regulations. Geoengineering technologies are in early stages with uncertain effectiveness. Limited studies on costs, environmental impacts, and legal implications. Some interest from foreign governments and private entities due to slow progress in greenhouse gas reductions. Limited federal involvement and oversight in the US, leading to piecemeal approaches. The U.S. government can address geoengineering at the federal level through various approaches, such as leaving policy development to federal agencies and states, imposing moratoriums on certain technologies, developing national policies, or collaborating with the international community. The government has a history of playing a significant role in the development of new technologies like nanotechnology, nuclear science, and genetic engineering."
