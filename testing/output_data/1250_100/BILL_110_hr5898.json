    "content": "The \"Silver Alert Grant Program Act of 2008\" aims to establish a grant program to improve State-administered notification systems for finding missing seniors and individuals with Alzheimer's or dementia-related illnesses. It also seeks to promote best practices for Silver Alert systems and increase awareness for coordinated efforts in locating missing individuals quickly. The Congress finds that Alzheimer's disease affects millions in the US, with a higher risk for older individuals. The aging population will lead to more cases in the future. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that over 60% of patients will wander away from their care facilities. States like Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas have implemented notification systems similar to the Amber Alert for missing seniors with dementia. Timely dissemination of information increases the chances of locating missing individuals. Other states have faced challenges in developing such systems due to budget constraints. The Sense of Congress is that Silver Alert systems should have clear criteria for issuing alerts, not based solely on age, and only for individuals unable to make personal decisions. Alerts should be initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing individual. The Sense of Congress is that Silver Alert systems should have clear criteria for issuing alerts, not based solely on age, and only for individuals unable to make personal decisions. Alerts should be initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing individual. Silver Alerts should protect the privacy and dignity of the individuals, encourage training for law enforcement officers on locating missing individuals with dementia-related illnesses, and promote coordination between State and local entities. The Federal Government can play a role in preventing injuries and loss of life among those with dementia.
