    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" and provides for the adjustment of status for certain nationals of Lebanon. The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows certain Lebanese nationals to adjust their status to permanent residence in the U.S. if they apply within 18 months of the Act's enactment and meet admissibility requirements, excluding specific grounds for inadmissibility. Additionally, aliens with deportation orders can still apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under the \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" do not need to file a separate motion to reopen, reconsider, or vacate their deportation order. If the Attorney General approves the application, the order will be canceled. However, if the application is denied, the order remains effective and enforceable. This provision applies to aliens granted temporary protected status in the U.S. under the designation of Lebanon on March 21, 1991, or any extension of the designation. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under the \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" must have voluntarily departed the United States before December 9, 1993, and have been physically present in the U.S. continuously since March 28, 1993. Proof of continuous presence must be provided. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under the \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" must have been physically present in the U.S. continuously since March 28, 1993. The Attorney General may provide regulations for demonstrating physical presence. The Attorney General can allow aliens with a final deportation order to seek a stay based on an application under subsection (a). The Attorney General may authorize an alien in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings to work in the U.S. while their adjustment of status application is pending. If the application exceeds 180 days without denial, employment authorization must be granted. Additionally, spouses and children of eligible aliens can also have their status adjusted. The Attorney General can adjust the status of an alien to that of a lawful permanent resident if the alien meets certain criteria, including being the spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of a qualifying alien. The alien must apply for adjustment within 18 months of the enactment of the Act, be physically present in the U.S. at the time of application, and be admissible to the country.

For establishing continuous physical presence, the alien must demonstrate that the period began no later than March 28, 1993, and can have absences totaling no more than 180 days. Applicants for adjustment of status have the right to administrative review. The Attorney General can adjust the status of an alien to that of a lawful permanent resident if certain criteria are met, including being a spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of a qualifying alien. Applicants have the same right to administrative review as those applying for adjustment of status under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Attorney General's determination on status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply, except where specifically provided otherwise. The alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence can still seek such status under other eligible provisions of the law."
