    "content": "Neural networks struggle to generalize transformations outside of their training data. A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this by learning how neurons encode transformations in a latent space. This allows for complex transformations with simpler distribution shifts, demonstrated in image domain/style transfer and biological applications. In biology, experiments often focus on the effects of treatments on samples. A neural network-based method is proposed to model the effects and interactions with background information, allowing for generalization beyond measured samples. This technique can be applied to tasks like image domain/style transfer and biological applications such as removing batch artifacts and predicting drug synergy. Neural network-based method proposed for learning edit function between pre-and post-treatment data distributions. Utilizes autoencoder with non-linear activations to train on entire dataset, allowing for generalization to other datasets. Internal layers represent data with abstract features for accurate reconstruction. Neuron editing involves extracting differences between pre-and post-treatment activation distributions in a neural network layer and applying them to generate post-treatment data synthetically. This technique encodes complex edits in a lower-dimensional manifold, leveraging the autoencoder's advantages for modeling distribution transformations. Neuron editing in a neural network layer allows for complex transformations in a lower-dimensional manifold, enabling the modeling of context-dependent effects. Edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in predictive ways, offering a more nuanced understanding of treatment outcomes compared to traditional generalization approaches. Neuron editing in a neural network layer enables complex transformations in a lower-dimensional manifold, avoiding noise and focusing on significant data dimensions. The assumption is that internal neurons maintain semantic consistency across data, supported by the autoencoder learning a joint manifold of all given data. Neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models, closely resembling predicted changes on extrapolated data. Neuron editing in a neural network layer enables complex transformations in a lower-dimensional manifold, avoiding noise and focusing on significant data dimensions. The editing process produces more complex variation by preserving existing data variation. Comparisons are made between neuron editing and generation-based approaches like traditional GANs, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN. Neuron editing is shown to outperform GANs in extrapolation tasks and is motivated by its performance in natural image domain transfer. In the context of neuron editing for complex transformations in a neural network layer, a transformation is sought on a learned space for domain transfer tasks. The transformation aims to produce equivalent distributions between source and target sets, while also being the identity function when applied to the target set. This approach differs from traditional GAN optimization paradigms and involves training an encoder/decoder pair to map data into an abstract neuron space with high-level features. The text discusses a transformation called NeuronEdit applied to distributions of activations in a neural network layer for domain transfer tasks. It aims to align distributions between source and target sets by adjusting activation distributions based on differences. The NeuronEdit function aligns activation distributions between source and target sets by transforming input distributions based on differences. It has properties of a GAN generator but ensures editing consistency between source and extrapolation distributions. The transformed output is obtained by cascading transformations through the decoder without further training, deviating from traditional autoencoder nomenclature to prevent undoing of transformations. Training a GAN in a frozen setting can utilize data exclusively from source and target sets, avoiding the need for real output examples. Neuron editing can model intrinsic variation in an unsupervised manner, providing more information than GANs. GANs are difficult to train due to oscillating dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse where the discriminator struggles to detect differences in variability between real and fake examples. Neuron editing offers a solution to the limitations of GANs by learning an unsupervised model of data space using an autoencoder. It isolates the variation in neuron activations to generate convincing entire distributions of post-transformation output. This approach is similar to word2vec embeddings in natural language processing, where meaningful transformations can be learned and extrapolated to other examples. Neuron editing extends word2vec's vector arithmetic by transforming entire distributions instead of single points. It is compared to various generating methods like regularized autoencoder, GANs, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN. Different models were used with specific layer configurations and activation functions for training on CelebA dataset. The difficulty in training GAN models on the CelebA dataset is illustrated when trying to apply transformations to out-of-sample data. The models struggle to accurately change attributes like hair color, often generating artifacts and inconsistent results. The benefits of avoiding complications in training GAN models are highlighted, with a focus on neuron editing for transforming neural networks. Neuron editing allows for complex transformations in a simple manner, demonstrated through applications like batch correction to address technical artifacts in data. Batch effects in biological experimental data can lead to incorrect conclusions. One method to address this is by repeatedly measuring an identical control set of cells with each sample and correcting based on the variation in the control. In a study using mass cytometry data from individuals infected with dengue virus, neuron editing was applied to transform the data and remove induced variations. In a study using mass cytometry data from individuals infected with dengue virus, the data consists of 35 dimensions with Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2 having different numbers of observations. Batch effects were observed in the controls, with artificially low readings in the protein InfG in Control1. The model aims to identify and compensate for this variation without losing other true biological differences. GANs and CycleGANs showed limitations in capturing the true biological variation in the data. The ResnetGAN and CycleGAN fail to preserve true biological variation in mass cytometry data, leading to misleading results. Neuron editing successfully removes batch effects while maintaining real variation in the data. Neuron editing accurately preserves biological variation in mass cytometry data, confirmed globally across all dimensions. The transformation from Control1 to Control2 mirrors the transformation applied to Sample1, with intra-sample variation preserved. Global assessments show that neuron editing reflects transformations as seen in controls. Additionally, biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is analyzed. The results show that neuron editing corrects batch effects in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 across different treatments in mass cytometry data. The study involves analyzing data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study aims to predict the effects of applying Das to cells previously treated with Bez. Das decreases p4EBP1 without affecting pSTATS. Neuron editing accurately models this change, while the regularized autoencoder does not alter the output. GAN models fail to accurately predict the combination, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variability. ResnetGAN struggles despite residual connections, as the GAN objective encourages output to mimic the target. The GAN objective fails to accurately replicate target data, showing a lack of appropriate transformation learning. Neuron editing better predicts transformation direction and magnitude across all dimensions, preserving data variation more effectively. This study addresses a data-transformation problem inspired by biological experimental settings, aiming to generate transformed data based on observed pre-and post-transformation versions. Neuron editing utilizes autoencoder latent layers to apply treatment effects to data, resulting in realistic transformations and predicting synergistic drug effects. Learning edits in hidden layers allows for complex data transformations and interactions with context information during decoding. Future work may involve training parallel encoders or generating data conditionally."
