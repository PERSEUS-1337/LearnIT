The 9/11 Commission found that aviation security experts underestimated the likelihood of a suicide hijacking scenario before September 11, 2001. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking, with a focus on passenger service rather than terrorism. Congress quickly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act after the attacks to address security weaknesses. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA, P.L. 107-71 ; 115 Stat. 597) was enacted to address weaknesses in aviation security highlighted by the 9/11 attacks. It established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation, including federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296 ; 116 Stat. 2135) later placed TSA within the Department of Homeland Security. The Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act established an aviation security capital fund to improve baggage screening efficiency and arm pilots. Despite these measures, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, and access controls for airport employees persist, as identified by congressional and administration oversight. The 9/11 Commission also highlighted weaknesses in cargo and general aviation security, inadequate screening, and access controls. The 9/11 Commission made recommendations for improvements in airport security, focusing on passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. They emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system that addresses various terrorist tactics and ensures coordination between different security measures. The 9/11 Commission's aviation security recommendations focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation. Six aviation-specific recommendations were identified, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, screening dangerous cargo, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security policy based on risk. The recommendation for transportation security policy is to prioritize based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. Passenger pre-screening on September 11, 2001 consisted of CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID checks. CAPPS now screens for possible hijackers using behavioral algorithms. The CAPPS system screens passengers based on behaviors to identify potential threats. CAPPS II, its successor, has faced controversy over data privacy concerns. It aims to authenticate passenger identities and cross-check them against terrorist watch lists. If flagged, passengers may face denial of boarding or additional screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended utilizing federal watchlists for improved pre-screening capabilities. Implementation of CAPPS II is limited to testing until verified by the Government Accountability Office. The CAPPS II program has faced challenges with data privacy concerns and reluctance from airlines to provide necessary information for testing. The Government Accountability Office found that only one of eight concerns had been adequately addressed. Recent reports suggest the program has been scrapped over privacy issues, but a new program may replace it. Congress may increase oversight of the Secure Flight program, the successor to CAPPS, and debate the best way to proceed. The TSA is set to take over prescreening responsibilities from airlines within 180 days of enactment, aligning with the Secure Flight program. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing past incidents like the Philippines Airlines bombing and Richard Reid's attempted attack with explosives in a shoe. Public concerns over improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were raised following these events. Nathaniel Heatwole sneaked banned items resembling explosives onto passenger jets, prompting the 9/11 Commission to recommend improving detection of explosives on passengers. Current screening technologies have limited capabilities, with new trace detection methods being tested at various airport sites. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving detection of explosives on passengers at airports, with various methods such as body scan imaging, bomb-sniffing dogs, and physical searches being considered. Congress may debate funding for implementing effective screening initiatives. Additionally, the TSA was advised to conduct a human factors study to enhance screener performance at checkpoints. The TSA has implemented initiatives to address poor screener performance, including expanding the use of threat image projection and improving recurrent training. However, research on aviation security human factors and funding for these activities are lacking compared to other agencies. There is a need for a comprehensive strategic plan to address human factors in aviation security. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. They may also consider tasking an independent body with examining human factors needs in aviation security. H.R. 10 contains a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance as part of a pilot program for next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. Congress may debate the adequacy of current funding for the expedited installation of in-line baggage screening systems recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The debate over funding for integrating EDS equipment at passenger airports continues, with only $250 million appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 out of the authorized $500 million annually. The TSA's approach of reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred may slow down the progress of EDS system integration. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of deploying in-line EDS systems, but defining a fair share remains a challenge. The debate over funding for integrating EDS equipment at passenger airports continues, with airlines and airports disagreeing on the fair share of costs. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share to 25% at large and medium-sized airports and 10% at small airports, a move opposed by airports. The 9/11 Commission recommended industry contribute more to the costs, leading to ongoing debate in Congress. The security appropriations bill (H.R. 4567) initially included provisions to limit federal funding for airport security projects, but these were removed during debate. A new bill (H.R. 5121) aims to increase aviation security fees for capital funding and enhance TSA's flexibility in baggage screening. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee emphasize the need for improved cargo screening and security measures in aviation and maritime operations. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003 based on recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. The plan includes a multi-layered risk-based approach with four key strategic objectives. Goals of the plan include pre-screening all cargo shipments, inspecting items considered to pose an elevated risk, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing enhanced security measures. The 9/11 Commission supports the TSA's approach but suggests accelerating progress towards achieving these objectives. The 9/11 Commission recommended intensifying cargo security efforts, with Congress debating the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. While some propose 100% screening, Congress supports a risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. Legislation like H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 specifically requiring TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission also recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. The National Research Council estimated that acquiring hardened cargo containers for passenger aircraft would cost $125 million, with an annual industry-wide cost of $11 million for lost revenue and increased fuel burn. Passenger airlines may oppose this initiative due to increased operational costs. Proponents argue that hardened cargo containers provide a redundant layer of defense, similar to hardened cockpit doors, in establishing a multi-layered security system. The TSA requires cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. There are concerns about adapting the system to allow suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. Congress may debate the effectiveness of hardened cargo containers in preventing cargo bombings. The debate revolves around allowing suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft in blast-resistant containers. H.R. 10 proposes a pilot program for evaluating these containers, while S. 2845 lacks a similar provision. The 9/11 Commission recommends establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets and developing a plan for implementing defenses. The strategic plan for aviation security focuses on a risk-based approach to allocate resources effectively. The TSA's initial focus post-9/11 attacks was on meeting ATSA mandates, but now there is a need for a unified national strategy for aviation security. A risk-based multi-layered approach is likely to be the core of future aviation security policy, in line with recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Congress may consider formally tasking the TSA with developing this strategy to address funding needs. The TSA needs to develop a national strategy for aviation security that includes funding needs, budget implications, and roles of federal, local, state authorities, and industry stakeholders. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement in aviation security. Local jurisdictions handle the physical security of airport sites, while TSA oversees security enforcement and passenger screening. The need for a unified plan or strategy for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders in aviation security is highlighted. Congress and the TSA are urged to improve strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security, in line with the 9/11 Commission recommendation. Congress and the TSA are urged to integrate aviation security strategies with a broader transportation security plan, including rail, maritime, and highway security. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop and update transportation security plans, prioritize risks, and allocate resources effectively. The 9/11 Commission recommendations have been a focus for Congress, leading to the passage of significant legislation in the 108th Congress. The 108th Congress passed aviation security legislation including Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L.108-176) and the National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Vision 100 established a redress process for aviation professionals and modified requirements for Air Defense Identification Zones. Vision 100 modified security training requirements for airline crews and mandated a study on aviation security effectiveness. It also created the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. The Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security was given authority to issue grants for airport security projects. Vision 100 authorized grants for airports to enhance baggage explosive detection systems, reconfigure terminal areas, and implement security programs for air charter operators. It also required a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system before full implementation by the TSA. The TSA has replaced the CAPPS II program with \"Secure Flight\" for prescreening. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include all-cargo airline crew members and required security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. It also transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to the DHS. The legislation requires flight schools to provide background checks for individuals training in smaller aircraft and authorizes fee collections to cover the costs. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including one for aviation security. This plan includes a threat matrix and mitigation strategies for terrorist attacks on the aviation system. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the use of biometrics for airport access control systems and establishes procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It allocates funds for research and development of biometric technologies and establishes a center of excellence in biometric technologies. Additionally, the act requires the TSA to test an advanced passenger prescreening system and implement passenger prescreening within 180 days after completing testing. It also mandates redress procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the system. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates biometrics for airport access control and establishes procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It requires TSA to minimize false positives, establish oversight boards, and address privacy concerns. DHS must prescreen international flights, individuals seeking FAA certificates, and those requesting access to secure airport areas against terrorist watch lists. TSA must also screen air charter customers voluntarily and report on privacy impacts of selectee and no-fly lists. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates biometrics for airport access control and establishes procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It requires TSA to minimize false positives, establish oversight boards, and address privacy concerns. DHS must prescreen international flights, individuals seeking FAA certificates, and those requesting access to secure airport areas against terrorist watch lists. The act also directs the DHS to prioritize developing airport screening technologies for detecting weapons and explosives, create a strategic plan for deploying explosive detection equipment at screening checkpoints, initiate a pilot program for advanced screening systems at airports, conduct a human factors study to improve screener performance, and protect the anonymity of Federal air marshals. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates biometrics for airport access control, training for law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism procedures, and encourages international agreements for Federal air marshal deployment on international flights. It authorizes the TSA to expedite in-line baggage screening equipment installation and increases funding for aviation security capital. The Aviation Security Act mandates the use of wireless communication technologies for cabin crew to notify pilots discreetly in case of security breaches. It also requires tamper-resistant pilot licenses with photographs, sets standards for screener staffing levels at airports, and authorizes $100 million for research on improved explosive detection systems. The Aviation Security Act mandates the use of wireless communication technologies for cabin crew to discreetly notify pilots of security breaches. It also prohibits airline passengers from carrying butane lighters and other inappropriate items, and urges international treaties to limit the proliferation of Man-portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADSs). Additionally, it requires expedited certification for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, assesses aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, and plans for airport security against this threat. The Aviation Security Act mandates various measures to enhance airport and aircraft security, including the evaluation of blast-resistant cargo containers, funding for air cargo and airport security improvements, research on technologies for air cargo screening, and the establishment of secure facilities for diverting and securing aircraft posing security threats. The Department of Homeland Security is directed to research, develop, and procure systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft. Policy concerns regarding general aviation security and air cargo security procedures were not adequately addressed during the 108th Congress. During the 108th Congress, legislation focused on general aviation security, including airport and airspace restrictions. Some provisions aimed to resume general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, while others made temporary flight restrictions permanent. However, the legislation was criticized for not being as comprehensive as other aviation security laws. Concerns over the risk posed by general aviation aircraft were raised following a joint assessment by the FBI and DHS. During the 108th Congress, air cargo security legislation was not adequately addressed, leading to concerns about oversight and implementation of TSA rules and strategic plans in the 109th Congress."
