The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project is being amended to extend the project under the same terms and conditions as in 1999, with modifications for the period from October 2000 to December 2001. The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project is being extended with modifications for the period from October 2000 to December 2001. The basic capitation rate for case management services will be reduced by 10-15% in certain demonstration sites. Case management fees will only be paid for enrollees classified as 'moderate' or 'at risk'. Each project site will implement protocols for telephonic contact based on standardized health assessments. The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project will implement care planning approaches, disease management programs for prevalent diseases, hospitalization tracking systems, and standardized patient educational materials. Quality improvement measures will be implemented at each site once during the 15-month period. Implementing enrollee satisfaction surveys and reporting on quality indicators for the enrolled population will be evaluated in a preliminary report by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The report will assess the impact on per beneficiary spending, health utilization measures, and enrollee satisfaction for the Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project. The Secretary will submit a final report to Committees on demonstration projects by July 1, 2002, including elements from the preliminary report but for the period after December 31, 1999. Evaluation of spending impact will compare data for enrolled individuals in the projects with a matched sample not enrolled in the project or Medicare+Choice plan. The amendments made by subsection (a) regarding Medicare+Choice plans and health care prepayment plans shall be effective as if included in the enactment of a previous Act."
