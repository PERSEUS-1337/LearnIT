    "title": "AB 918",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the risks of behavioral restraint and seclusion, as reported by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. California currently tracks and reports the use of restraint in state developmental centers but lacks public data on other facilities. Consistent data collection and public access to this information are key to reducing the use of restraint. The Legislature aims to make data on restraint use in care facilities publicly available to ensure quality services for individuals with developmental disabilities and reduce restraint usage. Definitions for physical and chemical restraint, long-term health care facility, and acute psychiatric hospital are provided in the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Department will report data on physical and chemical restraint use by regional center vendors, long-term health care facilities, and acute psychiatric hospitals serving individuals with developmental disabilities. Quarterly data will include the number of incidents of physical and chemical restraint for each vendor and facility. The new section 4659.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines terms related to restraint use in facilities serving individuals with developmental disabilities, including physical restraint, chemical restraint, and seclusion. It also specifies the types of facilities covered, such as long-term health care facilities and acute psychiatric hospitals. Regional center vendors providing residential services or supported living services, long-term health care facilities, and acute psychiatric hospitals must report any death or serious injury related to the use of seclusion, physical restraint, or chemical restraint to the designated agency by the next business day. The report should include the person's encrypted identifier, facility name, address, and contact number."
