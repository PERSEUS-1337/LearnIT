    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and CDBG. FHA insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus funds have been used to support the HUD budget, including emergency supplemental funding. Over the past five years, HUD's regular funding has increased by 57%, with significant year-over-year growth in recent years. Adjusting for inflation, the budget has seen consistent increases, with nearly 12% growth in FY2010. HUD's budget has seen significant growth in recent years, with a nearly 12% increase in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the budget grew by about 17% over a nine-year period. The funding is made up of various components, including regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Most of the growth in the past nine years occurred in the last two years, with funding mainly coming from regular annual appropriations. The funding for HUD's budget has increased significantly in recent years, mainly through regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Congressional appropriators face limits on new discretionary funding, leading to the use of offsets like rescissions and offsetting receipts to stay within these limits. Net budget authority, determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets, is crucial for federal budgeting. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, reaching over $46 billion. However, this increase was not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during this period, while offsetting receipts and collections declined by more than 70% and rescinded amounts decreased by 96%. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, reaching over $46 billion. The growth in regular appropriations during this period is largely due to increases in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which account for the largest component of the HUD budget. Appropriations for the combined Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, while funding for all other HUD programs only grew by 8%. Section 8 programs went from 46% to 57% of HUD's regular appropriations from FY2002 to FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010 after years of decline. The decline in offsetting receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs has led to a decrease in available funds to offset new HUD appropriations. The appropriations process typically starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. If Congress does not complete appropriations before the fiscal year ends on September 30, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted to maintain funding at prior year levels. The FY2011 appropriations process began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010. The appropriations process for FY2011 began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010, and concluded with the signing of P.L. 112-10 into law on April 15, 2011. The process spanned two calendar years and two Congresses. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, representing a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The budget proposed offsetting collections and receipts from changes to the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The President's budget for FY2011 requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs. Decreased funding was requested for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing repairs. The House-approved HUD funding bill would have provided $1 billion more than requested, with a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The bill rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing funding, and the brownfields program. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill that would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing funding, and the brownfields program. The bill also funded the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to fund most federal accounts at FY2010 levels, including HUD's budget. The last CR extended funding until March 4, 2011, or until FY2011 appropriations were enacted. It also extended FHA mortgage limits. The House approved a year-long CR (H.R. 1) to fund the government through FY2011, maintaining FY2010 levels for many HUD accounts but cutting others. H.R. 1 proposed $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations (11%) for HUD programs compared to FY2010, with a net new budget authority of $7 billion less (16%). The Senate Amendment to H.R. 1 would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. The 112th Congress approved short-term CRs to fund the government, with funding reductions for some accounts, including the Community Development Fund (CDF) for HUD. The CDF was funded at a level $195 million lower than FY2010, equivalent to the amount previously provided for congressional earmarks. Congress enacted another short-term CR maintaining most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but continuing the reduction in funding for the CDF. The 112th Congress approved short-term CRs to fund the government, with funding reductions for some accounts, including the Community Development Fund (CDF) for HUD. The CDF was funded at a level $195 million lower than FY2010, equivalent to the amount previously provided for congressional earmarks. Further short-term CRs maintained most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels, but reduced funding for the CDF and HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account. P.L. 112-8 extended funding through April 15, 2011, while work on a final FY2011 funding bill was completed. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD, funding some programs at FY2010 levels, reducing funding for others, and increasing funding for the two Section 8 programs. The law provided $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of 11% from FY2010. The decrease in budget authority would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to an increase in offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more widely available. FHA programs are administered through the MMI/CMHI and GI/SRI accounts in the HUD budget. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund is the largest of the FHA insurance funds, covering single-family home loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the reverse mortgage program into the MMI Fund, creating two risk categories. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier mortgages, multifamily housing, and special-purpose loans. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 governs the cost of these programs. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance by calculating the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume, reflects whether cash inflows exceed outflows (negative subsidy rate) or vice versa (positive subsidy rate). This subsidy rate is used to calculate the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs, with appropriations required in the budget year loans are originated. Actual cash flows over the loan life may differ from initial projections. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 determines federal loan insurance costs by calculating expected cash flows. Agencies must periodically revise subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, making money for the government. It is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk categories, with a projected negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011. The Administration estimated that the Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund would generate about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy for FY2011. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the same category, including proposed program reforms by HUD. Despite differences in projections, both estimates suggest that this category would not require a positive credit subsidy in FY2011. In FY2011, FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy increased due to a rise in annual premiums. The President's FY2012 budget projected a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Purchase and Refinance risk category, leading to nearly $10 billion in offsetting receipts. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts by over $1 billion during the FY2011 appropriations process. In FY2011, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund. The MMI HECM risk category is estimated to have a positive credit subsidy of 0.83% and will require a $250 million appropriation. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies, including increasing annual insurance premiums and adjusting the loan size formula. H.R. 5850 would have provided $140 million in credit subsidies for HECMs. The final FY2012 appropriations law continued language directing adjustments to the HECM program for zero credit subsidy. FHA-insured mortgages have been increasing due to tightening lending standards. FHA insured 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009. The average credit score on FHA-insured loans has improved. Default rates on past FHA-insured loans are rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. The FHA-insured loans are increasing, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% within 10 years. The ratio fell below 2% in FY2009 for the first time. FHA proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. FHA increased annual insurance premiums after P.L. 111-229 was enacted in 2010. The upfront premium was raised to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, below the statutory cap of 3%. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted in 2010, FHA raised the annual mortgage insurance premium and lowered the upfront premium to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. FHA also proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a minimum 10% downpayment for credit scores between 500 and 579, and reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3%. These changes were published for comments in a Federal Register notice on July 15, 2010. FHA increased oversight of approved lenders through administrative changes and sought additional enforcement authority from Congress. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to grant FHA the power to require lenders to indemnify for non-compliant mortgages and fraud cases, terminate approval for high default rates, and establish a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to grant FHA more oversight over approved lenders and sought additional enforcement authority from Congress. It proposed abolishing the position of FHA chief risk officer and allowing FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs to nonprofit developers for building or rehabilitating housing units for elderly and disabled residents. The President proposed no new funding for Section 202 or Section 811 housing in FY2011 to redesign the programs. The President proposed redesigning the Section 202 and Section 811 programs, resulting in reduced funding. The proposed funding for Section 202 and related programs would be $274 million, down from $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would receive $90 million in FY2011, compared to $300 million in FY2010. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations and maintained the same funding levels as FY2010 for Section 202. The difference in proposed funding levels between H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers. Funding for voucher renewals was moved to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. Congress ultimately appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs and $150 million for the Section 811 program. Of the $150 million, $67 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals split between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. The Section 8 tenant-based account received $67 million for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than in FY2010. $89 million was allocated for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest assistance program administered by HUD, funding almost 2.3 million vouchers for housing subsidies. Funding covers renewal and administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Since FY2004, funding for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program has been a key debate in HUD appropriations. Congress provided over $16 billion in FY2010 for voucher renewals, allocated based on PHAs' prior year costs and utilization. The funding was sufficient for over 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility, but some vouchers were not utilized in FY2009. In FY2009, PHAs leased about 94% of their vouchers, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 for all vouchers. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals to cover about 95% of all vouchers. The funding allocation formula was to be similar to FY2010, with the Secretary having the authority to adjust allocations based on PHAs' reserve funding levels. The President's FY2011 budget requested an increase in funding for agencies with little reserves to serve more families. The budget also proposed lifting the ban on \"over-leasing\" to allow PHAs to fund additional vouchers. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than requested, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report stated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be sufficient to meet the program's renewal needs and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The committee report on H.R. 5850 supported funding all vouchers in use but did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The bill aimed to base PHA funding on prior calendar year spending instead of fiscal year spending to better reflect the program's needs. Similarly, S. 3644 would have funded renewals at less than the President's request, using the same formula as H.R. 5850 but adjusting it to use calendar year spending. The Senate bill, like the House bill, did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases and financial management in the program. Both bills allocated less for renewals than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested funding renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities through the Section 8 account, which both bills proposed to adopt. The House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's request for funding. H.R. 1 did not include funding for renewing Section 811 vouchers as requested. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than a third of the amount requested for Section 811 renewals. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million. Congress creates additional vouchers, including tenant protection and incremental vouchers for special populations or purposes. In recent years, incremental vouchers have been allocated for families in the child welfare system and homeless veterans. The President's budget requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing for families at risk of homelessness in FY2011. The House and Senate bills included funding for homeless veterans and families displaced by hurricanes. The Senate bill also allocated funds for the Family Unification Program. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account provides funding to renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private property owners. Congress funded contracts for 20- to 40-year periods, but new appropriations are needed once contracts expire. In FY2011, over $9 billion was requested for this account, a 10% increase from the prior year. In FY2011, the rental assistance account requested over $9 billion, a 10% increase from the prior year. HUD believes the funding level should be enough to cover all contracts and renew expiring ones. The President's FY2011 budget proposed continuing the use of advance appropriations. Both the House and Senate bills supported the President's funding level, with slight variations in the final appropriations law. President Obama also requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative. The \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative aims to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. It involves transferring HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility, similar to the Section 8 program. The initiative targets 300,000 units, including public housing properties owned by local PHAs without a Section 8 program. The \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative targets 300,000 units for streamlining HUD's rental assistance programs. It includes administering Section 8 vouchers, combining administrative activities of PHAs, and converting old rental assistance programs. Most of the funding would cover the difference in subsidy levels, with additional funds for PHA activities, landlord outreach, and program evaluation. HUD plans to submit legislation to Congress for implementation. HUD plans to submit legislation to Congress for the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act. The proposal was rejected due to concerns about its development and unknown future costs. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in the final FY2011 appropriations law. Public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for low-income families through over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). HUD provides funding to PHAs for maintenance, utilities, and administration of public housing, as well as capital projects and modernization needs. The HOPE VI grant program focuses on redeveloping distressed housing into mixed-income communities. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund, citing previous capital funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Administration aims to fully fund the operating fund to free up more capital funds for capital needs. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request with a $500 million increase for the capital fund. The Senate bill included a $50 million set-aside from the capital fund for early childhood education in public housing. H.R. 1 proposed cuts to the public housing capital and operating funds in FY2011. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and the operating fund slightly less than H.R. 1. PHAs may offset reduced operating fund appropriations with program reserves. The President proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves in his FY2012 budget request. The budget requested $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal modeled after the HOPE VI program. This initiative aims to revitalize severely distressed neighborhoods, not limited to public housing, and is open to various entities for funding competition. Congress allocated $200 million to the HOPE VI account in FY2010, with up to $65 million set aside for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. In FY2011, Congress had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 suggested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) allocated just under $100 million for HOPE VI and maintained the $65 million set-aside from FY2010, potentially allowing most HOPE VI funding to be used for Choice Neighborhoods. The Housing Trust Fund, created in 2008, was intended to provide a dedicated source of funding for affordable housing. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended in 2008, leaving the fund without funding. Despite the possibility of other funding sources, no money has been directed to the fund yet. The Housing Trust Fund, created in 2008 to provide funding for affordable housing, has not received any funding yet. The President's budget requests for FY2010 and FY2011 included $1 billion for the fund, but Congress did not allocate any money. Despite legislative proposals in the 111th Congress, no funding has been provided. The Transformation Initiative aims to enhance HUD's research and technology capabilities, with funding for research, evaluation, and technological advancements. The fund may be used for research, evaluation, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority. The fund received $239 million due to restrictions. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, which could have resulted in almost $470 million for the transformation fund. The House and Senate bills limited the total funding available for transfers to well under half of what the President requested. Both bills proposed limits on the department's discretion by giving directions on fund allocation. The Transformation Initiative funds were restricted to core Department needs, with oversight emphasized. Minimum funding levels were recommended for IT modernization. The Committee recommends minimum funding levels for IT modernization and technical assistance. H.R. 1 did not include transfer authority under the Transformation Initiative. Instead of $20 million for combating mortgage fraud, the bill allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and Section 8 voucher program. The final FY2011 appropriations law included $71 million for new FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems, with HUD granted transfer authority under the transformation initiative from a limited number of accounts. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform CDBG and related programs. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed funding reductions for Community Development Fund activities, including defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants used for congressional earmarks. The savings would be redirected towards Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund programs. The Administration proposed new initiatives for economic development projects in distressed communities, including the Catalytic Investments Competition Grants. The President's budget requested no new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing duplication with other federal programs. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for Community Development Fund activities, including congressional earmarked funds for Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative projects. The Senate bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation, with funding for congressional earmarked projects in Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $3.501 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, a 21.2% decrease from FY2010. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) funding was cut by 33%. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) program was not funded. The CDF supports activities through the CDBG program and other community development-related programs. The CDF has funded community development programs like EDI and NI in the past. The CDBG program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a major federal source for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. In 2010, CDBG funds were awarded to various entities. The program can be used for activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, addressing slums or blight, or public health threats. The FY2011 budget proposed freezing CDBG funding at over $3.9 billion. The budget request for the CDBG program in FY2011 was over $3.9 billion. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the program slightly higher than the President's request and the FY2010 funding level. The House passed H.R. 1, which would have reduced CDF account funding by 66.3% below the FY2010 level and prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account by $7 million to $3.501 billion, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative called Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) under the CDF account. Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to support economic development projects in distressed areas, including green infrastructure, economic recovery, transit-oriented development, and small business assistance. Grant funds would also cover administrative costs. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) in FY2011, which includes Regional Integrated Planning Grants for metropolitan areas to develop sustainable community models. The funds are to be used for various disciplines critical to sustainable development, in collaboration with multiple federal agencies. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) in FY2011 allocated funds for metropolitan areas to improve housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) were competitively awarded to promote sustainable growth. Housing-Transportation Integration Research was also funded to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs of various efforts. The Administration proposed capacity building as a new component of the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) in FY2011, seeking support to improve technical capacity. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continued funding of SCI at $148.5 million, with a set-aside of $25 million for metropolitan areas with populations under 500,000. Additionally, $25 million was recommended for the Rural Innovation Fund (RIF) to assist state efforts. The recommended $25 million in funding for the Rural Innovation Fund (RIF) is intended to assist various organizations in addressing housing and poverty-related issues, including rural Indian tribes. The bills also include provisions for HUD's Transformation Initiative and prohibit the use of Community Development Fund dollars for SCI activities. Additionally, P.L. 112-10 appropriated $99.8 million for SCI activities, representing a 33% reduction from FY2010 funding levels. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment financing. The Administration proposed doubling the Section 108 loan program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance redevelopment activities. States and entitlement communities can borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying projects, with current and future CDBG allocations pledged as security. The proposal includes charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills recommended maintaining the Section 108 loan program as is, with different loan commitment ceilings and credit subsidies. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed redesigning the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program to provide technical assistance and funds through national intermediaries. The Administration's budget proposed increasing funding for the capacity building program by $10 million to $60 million. The program would be a stand-alone account, with grants awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. Assistance would be provided to CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments to enhance their capabilities for community development and affordable housing activities. The capacity building program aimed to support community development and affordable housing activities for low- and moderate-income individuals. Funding would have been used for training, education, loans, grants, market research, and organizational assessments. Grantees were required to match funds from private sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for this initiative. Instead, funding for capacity building activities was recommended to continue through existing programs like the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program. The Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account funds the SHOP program, Capacity Building for Community Development, and the Housing Assistance Council. SHOP provides grants for self-help homeownership, capacity building offers technical assistance, and HAC supports rural housing needs. The President's FY2011 budget did not allocate funds for the SHOP account. The President's FY2011 budget did not allocate funds for the SHOP account. However, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included a total of $82 million for the SHOP account, with $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC. The final FY2011 appropriations law continued funding for these activities at the FY2010 levels. Total FY2011 funding for account activities was $81.8 million. HUD allocated $81.8 million for various account activities, including $26.9 million for SHOP, $49.9 million for Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing, and $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council. Funding for the Housing Counseling Assistance Program has increased in recent years due to concerns about mortgage default and foreclosure rates. Funding for the Housing Counseling Assistance Program increased from $39 million to $87.5 million between FY2003 and FY2010. In FY2011, the President's budget requested $88 million for the program, but the final appropriations law eliminated funding. Some argue that the program's funding is duplicative. Some argue that HUD housing counseling funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program funding, but HUD funding can be used for a wider variety of counseling types. HUD has faced criticism for slow distribution of housing counseling grants. Congress has separately funded foreclosure mitigation counseling through NeighborWorks America since FY2008. NeighborWorks received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities, which was 50% more than its regular base appropriation. Funding for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) has continued since then, with varying amounts allocated. The President's budget requested $113 million for the NFMCP in FY2011, while H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $113 million and $125 million respectively for the program. S. 3644 also allocated $24 million more for housing activities compared to the House-passed bill and the President's budget. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) at the FY2010 level of $65 million. Housing counseling agencies support the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) by providing counseling to eligible troubled borrowers. Recipients of NFMCP funding can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. The Native American Housing Block Grants program provides housing assistance to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households through formula-based grants to Indian tribes. In FY2010, Congress allocated $700 million for the program, with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget proposed $580 million for the program, a decrease of $120 million from the previous year, without any set-asides for technical assistance or the National American Indian Housing Council. The President's budget did not request set-asides for technical assistance or the National American Indian Housing Council. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $700 million for the NAHBG account, maintaining set-asides at FY2010 levels. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided nearly $650 million to the NAHBG account, slightly lower than FY2010 but higher than the President's request. The FY2011 Budget Resolution established spending parameters and allocations for House and Senate committees. The budget resolution provided spending allocations to House and Senate committees, which then divided their allocation among their subcommittees responsible for appropriations bills. The House and Senate budget committees began considering the FY2011 budget resolution after receiving the President's budget. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011, but no further action was taken. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution in the absence of an agreement on a budget resolution. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution (H.Res. 1493) on July 1, 2010, setting FY2011 spending levels for the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate did not agree to enforceable spending allocations but provided subcommittee spending guidance for FY2011 regular appropriations bills. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion for NSP grants, with funds available from October 1, 2010, considered FY2011 funds. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program provided $1 billion in mortgage assistance to homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss.
