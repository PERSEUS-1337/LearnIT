    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, leading to the bill being signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of high congressional interest. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were set before the September 11 attacks, with increases for Army and Marine Corps due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress has since reversed some increases due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints, with Air Force and Navy end-strengths generally declining since 2001. Authorized end-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services. House bill approved higher end-strengths than Administration's request, with notable increase for Army. Navy end-strength was reduced but still higher than Administration request. Final bill sets minimum end-strengths at level equal to authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two. The House bill proposed higher end-strengths for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act discusses military personnel issues, including the annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. Congress has not specified a pay raise for the past three years. The President invoked alternative pay adjustment authority for the past three years, setting pay raises below the ECI. The FY2017 budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% pay raise effective January 1, 2017. Reference(s): CRS In Focus IF10260, Defense Primer: Military Pay Raise. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status for servicemembers in the United States. The Senate bill proposed changes to calculate BAH based only on paygrade and location, excluding dependents. The Senate bill proposed changes to the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), shifting to a system based on servicemember housing expenditures and reducing the allowance for those sharing living quarters. The new formula would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018. The enacted bill requires DOD to transition to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017, eliminating Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. The provision aims to address the evolution of BAH over the past 20 years and its intended purpose of offsetting housing costs for servicemembers. The housing benefit for servicemembers is intended to offset housing costs in high-cost areas where government quarters are not available. The tax-free allowance is meant for compensation, not as an additional benefit. The Secretary of Defense is directed to transition to a salary system aligning with this purpose. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016, including reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type element, and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for eligible servicemembers. Concerns have been raised about the impact of the reduced retired pay multiplier on retaining certain occupational specialties. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at 8 to 12 years of service in return for a 3-year commitment. This provision allows for targeted continuation pay based on retention trends for specific military specialties and adjusts procedures for calculating minimum pay for active and reserve component members. The sense of Congress was to default TSP contributions to a Roth plan, which is beneficial for young, low-income individuals. The provision was not adopted, but Section 631 of the Senate bill allows cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases. The amount of retired pay is based on pay grade and years of service. Currently, up to 50% of disposable retired pay can be divided in a divorce case. Proposed changes would base the division on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order. The enacted bill authorizes changes in the definition of disposable retired pay, including cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. This provision does not affect divorce settlements prior to the enactment date. Military retirees may have a portion of their monthly pay withheld for Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments to surviving spouses. The FY2017 NDAA addressed disparate treatment in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments for servicemembers who died on active duty versus during inactive-duty training. Surviving spouses receiving SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, offset by the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill amended provisions to eliminate the differential treatment under SBP for reserve component and active component members who die from an injury or illness incurred in the line of duty. Section 643 of the FY2017 NDAA allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from CRSC when retired pay is insufficient. Section 646 extends SSIA authority until May 31, 2018. Section 648 requires an independent assessment of SBP effectiveness. The report evaluates the effectiveness of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for survivors of servicemembers who die on active duty or in reserve active-status. It compares SBP benefits with those of other government and private sector employees and explores the feasibility of providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products. TRICARE is the DOD-administered health benefits program for active duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families, with proposed changes to enrollment fees and benefit structures in the Administration's FY2017 Budget. TRICARE Preferred options include a new annual enrollment period, enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and a catastrophic cap. There are increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, but not for active duty members. The proposal aims to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by implementing changes in the benefit structure and enrollment fees. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed TRICARE proposals in the President's Budget, which also includes contributions to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) by each uniformed service member. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of TRICARE proposals in the President's Budget estimated savings and costs over a 10-year period. The proposals include pharmacy co-payment increases saving $2.8 billion, a new TRICARE for Life enrollment fee saving $1.4 billion, and TRICARE plan consolidation costing $0.2 billion. Additionally, the proposals would increase Medicare spending by $0.4 billion. Section 701 of the enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, sets enrollment fees and deductibles, and requires an open enrollment period with qualifying events for annual participation in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE plans in the FY2017 budget, including replacing Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and adding an enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life. The House-passed bill includes provisions to limit pre-authorization requirements, establish a pilot program for value-based healthcare, and require a review of the implementation plan by the Comptroller General. The enacted bill amends TRICARE plans by consolidating TRICARE Standard and Extra into TRICARE Preferred or TRICARE Choice plans. Cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees are specified in tables, with exceptions for disability retirees. A \"reserve and young adult\" category is created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Premiums for these programs remain the same, but new cost-sharing provisions apply. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will have a $150 individual cost-sharing limit. Beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after the Comptroller General submits a report to the armed services committees. The report, due by February 1, 2020, will assess changes in healthcare coverage, appointment access, provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries without a referral must get a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act addresses military personnel issues related to TRICARE pharmacy program. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual increases in pharmacy co-payments to save money. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for co-payment increases, but previous legislation had already implemented increases in pharmacy co-payments. The Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical facilities. Section 702 of the bill would have authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude certain drugs from coverage and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. This could have reduced DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over a 5-year period and saved $2.7 billion in health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries over a 10-year period. The Care Fund (MERHCF) would have seen reduced accrual payments by about $1.5 billion over the 2018-2021 period if Section 702 was implemented. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services and manage the TRICARE program. The DHA oversees shared services and acts as the market manager for the National Capital Region enhanced Multi-Service Market. The conference report suggests that a single agency should manage all military treatment facilities to improve operational medical force readiness, beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and lower costs. The current organizational structure of three separate health systems managed by each Service is seen as hindering rapid decision-making and innovation. Streamlining the management structure would eliminate redundancy, increase efficiency, save money, and improve the overall experience of care for beneficiaries. Section 702 of the enacted bill requires the Director of the Defense Health Agency to take responsibility for the administration of military treatment facilities, including budget, IT, healthcare management, and policy. It also outlines the roles of the services' Surgeons General as principal advisors to the Secretary on health matters. Section 702 of the enacted bill requires the Director of the Defense Health Agency to oversee military treatment facilities, including budget, IT, healthcare management, and policy. It also designates the services' Surgeons General as principal health advisors to the Secretary. Section 703 adds a new section to Title 10 of the US Code, mandating the maintenance of medical facilities to support armed forces' medical readiness in areas lacking civilian healthcare support. The current law for enlistees in the active and reserve components has specific citizenship and residency requirements. The Senate bill proposed aligning the reserve component requirements with those of the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. Enlistment citizenship requirements can be waived if deemed vital to national interest. The Department of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently authorized for a maximum of 10 days. A servicemember who adopts a child is eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. Parental leave policies for servicemembers have been updated, with maternity leave extended to 12 weeks and plans to extend parental leave to 14 days. The primary caregiver can take up to 12 weeks of leave for the birth of a child and 6 weeks for adoption, while secondary caregivers can take up to 21 days. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers, and the leave must be taken within a year of the event. Eligibility is for active duty or reserve members on active duty exceeding 12 months. The final bill includes provisions for parental leave for servicemembers, with maternity leave extended to 12 weeks and plans to extend parental leave to 14 days. The Secretary of Defense can prescribe regulations for servicemembers taking parental leave, and a new provision explicitly prohibits unauthorized leave for military members. Paid parental leave is supported for recruitment and retention purposes, benefiting military families. In FY2016, Congress authorized $1.4 billion in commissary funding, $100 million more than the President's budget request. The President's FY2017 budget proposed $1.2 billion for commissaries, a reduction of $200 million in subsidies for stateside commissaries from FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, Guard and Reserve component members, retired personnel and their families, 100% disabled veterans, Medal of Honor recipients, and DOD civilians stationed at U.S. installations overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report with a plan to obtain budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange. The FY2016 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report with a plan to obtain budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The DOD released a report on June 7, 2016, stating that privatization would not replicate the benefits provided by DeCA while achieving budget neutrality. Critics argue that more evaluation is needed before initiating a pilot program. Additionally, a Comptroller General assessment published on November 9, 2016, specified that DOD's plan lacks details on achieving budget neutrality by October 2018 without taxpayer dollars. The DOD report addressed benchmarks for the commissary and exchange systems, but lacked specific metrics. Sections 661 and 662 of the bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand. A report on the Commissary Surcharge is pending. The conference report authorizes the use of the Military Star Card at commissaries, implementing reforms to ensure savings for patrons and support for MWR activities. Reforms include congressional oversight, common business practices, and variable pricing for private label products. DeCA will set prices based on market conditions and may add a markup to private label goods to offset operating costs, reducing direct spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade. The enacted bill requires DOD to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchange network to reduce reliance on appropriated funds. Commissaries may use flexible pricing to maintain savings, with potential conversion to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are sustained. The Defense Secretary must ensure no loss in pay for DeCA employees during conversion. DOD can engage commercial grocery industry experts to improve commissary operations. Acceptance of the Military Star Card is authorized. The conference report authorizes acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores. This is part of efforts to achieve budget neutrality for the commissary and exchange system. Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemembers in the past few decades. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember education, credentialing programs, and transition services. Key programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation of credentialing programs. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on specific transition initiatives for servicemembers to obtain merchant mariner licenses. The final bill includes provisions for servicemembers to obtain merchant mariner licenses, deadlines for TWIC applications, counseling on substance abuse during TAP training, and notification on separation payments recoupment. Additionally, a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members was not adopted. The most senior military officers are general officers or flag officers, holding important positions in the DOD. The number of officers in each grade is limited by statute, and Congress periodically reviews their duties and compensation. Section 910 of the House bill would have required specific commanders to be of a certain grade. The bill proposed reducing the number of active duty generals and admirals, establishing a new unified combatant command for cyber operations, and reducing the number of authorized active and reserve general and flag officers by 25%. The Senate bill also aimed to eliminate certain grade requirements in various military communities. The enacted bill requires a reduction of 110 general and flag officers by December 31, 2022, amounting to about 11% of authorized positions. The reductions will be distributed across the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and joint pool. Additionally, 30 additional GFO positions are allocated to the joint pool for contingency operations. The Secretary of Defense can adjust reductions in general and flag officers for national security, with notification to House and Senate Armed Services Committees. A global manpower study justifies GFO positions and recommends a 10% reduction, to be submitted by April 1, 2017. Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. outlines requirements for active duty officers to become joint qualified officers by completing specific educational and duty assignments related to unified military operations across different domains. There is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of current qualification standards in developing officers with the necessary mix of service and joint experiences. To become a joint qualified officer, individuals must complete specific joint professional military education requirements and a two-year joint duty assignment. The House and Senate bills aimed to standardize the length of joint duty assignments for all officers and expand the definition of joint matters to include various areas such as intelligence, fires, movement, protection, and sustainment under unified command. The enacted bill modified the definition of joint duty assignment and joint matters for officers. The bill adopted Senate language for joint duty assignments and House language for the definition of \"joint matters.\" This change aimed to standardize joint duty assignment lengths and expand the scope of joint matters. The Selective Service System (SSS) is an independent federal agency responsible for delivering qualified civilian men for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States. Most males between 18 and 26 who are citizens or residents of the US must register with Selective Service. Failure to register can lead to criminal penalties, loss of certain benefits, and denial of security clearances. Recent policy changes have raised questions about the exemption for women, with some advocating for their registration. The bill aimed to expand selective service registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. A detailed review of the Selective Service System was mandated in the final bill, along with the establishment of an independent commission to examine its benefits and viability. This commission would operate over 36 months with a $15 million funding authorization in FY2017. The issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant attention in recent years. In 2005, the Department of Defense implemented its first department-wide sexual assault policies, following recommendations from the Joint Task Force for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. This led to the establishment of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) as the primary oversight body for service-level programs. In 2013, DOD released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan. The Department of Defense (DOD) released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan in January 2015. DOD has implemented various initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, sexual assault prevention, victim services, and reporting. The Senate bill proposed extending reporting requirements to 2025, while the conference bill extended them to January 31, 2021. The estimated cost for preparing the FY2015 report was $6.9 million. The report included findings from focus groups on sexual assault prevention and response. The feedback from focus groups and surveys on sexual assault prevention in the military highlighted concerns about retaliation for reporting incidents. Both the House and Senate bills aimed to increase training for investigators, with a focus on clarifying definitions of retaliation. The enacted bill adopted the Senate provision with an amendment, while a proposed modification to burden of proof requirements was not included. The conferees expressed ongoing concern about reports of retaliation and plan to assess the impact of the bill on reducing retaliation in the military. The enacted bill includes provisions to address retaliation in the military related to reports of sexual assault. It amends laws to provide additional medical assessments and enhanced discharge review board consideration for servicemembers and veterans with PTSD or TBI from sexual trauma. Currently, sexual harassment is handled under the Military Equal Opportunity Program, while SAPRO oversees sexual assault policies. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the existing definition of sexual harassment in the military, leading to modifications in the enacted bill for investigating complaints by commanding officers. This is part of ongoing efforts to address sexual assault in the military, with SAPRO overseeing sexual assault policies. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, raising concerns about prevention and reporting. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) implements DOD's initiatives for child and domestic abuse prevention, education, and training. Data sharing between DOD and states on child abuse cases involving military families is required by law. Section 575 of the final bill mandates DOD personnel to report suspected instances of child abuse. Section 575 of the final bill requires DOD personnel to directly notify state child welfare agencies of suspected child abuse, along with designated DOD representatives. An annual Family Advocacy Program report to Congress on child abuse and domestic abuse data is mandated, with the first report due on April 30, 2017. Proponents believe this will enhance reporting and oversight of abuse in military families. The Senate bill's requirement for employee criminal background checks in DOD domestic schools was not included in the final bill, but language urging collaboration with local school districts to share best practices was added. The Department is directed to report on efforts to improve employment screening policies in school districts educating military family members. Recommendations will be provided to address any identified shortfalls in employee screening processes. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and service regulations. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) was tasked with proposing legislative changes to the UCMJ and implementing rules in the MCM. The Department of Defense submitted the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress based on the MJRG's work. The proposed House bill aimed to revise the UCMJ comprehensively, including changes to courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. It would have allowed the government to appeal sentences deemed unlawful or unreasonable, introduced new offenses, and reorganized the punitive articles. The proposed Senate bill addressed prohibited activities with military recruits, fraudulent use of credit cards, offenses concerning government computers, and retaliation. It also included changes to military justice such as courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Differences existed between the House and Senate language, particularly in terms of government appeal of sentences and reorganization of punitive articles. The Senate language proposed military-specific sentencing parameters and criteria, with deviations appealable by the government. The Senate bill differed from the House language in changes related to rape and sexual assault in the military. It proposed adding the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a punishable offense. The final bill included a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ but omitted provisions for interim guidance on sentencing parameters, an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, and changes to Art. 120. The Medal of Honor (MOH) review process has faced criticism for being lengthy and bureaucratic, leading to lost records and conflicting evidence. The reluctance to retroactively award or upgrade medals aims to maintain integrity but has been seen as overly restrictive. DOD periodically reviews inquiries and historical records, with a recent review in 2016 focusing on military awards and decorations since September 11, 2001 in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Service Cross and Silver Star Review results are expected by September 30, 2017. The final bill includes provisions for waiving time limitations to authorize valor awards for certain military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The waiver expires on December 31, 2019. The bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. It also requires a review of service records for eligible veterans of Asian American or Native American Pacific Island descent who were previously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, or Air Force Cross. If records support the award of the Medal of Honor, the statutory time limitations will be waived. The section waives statutory time limitations for award of the Medal of Honor. Congress often requests pilot studies and reports related to military personnel issues within the National Defense Authorization Act."
