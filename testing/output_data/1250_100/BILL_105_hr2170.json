    "content": "Reimbursement for adoption expenses is added to Subpart G of part III of title 5, United States Code, under CHAPTER 90--MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. \"Sec. 9001. Adoption benefits define terms related to adoption expenses, including agency, employee exclusions, and types of expenses covered.\" The regulations establish a program for agency employees to be reimbursed for adoption expenses, including care for the child, physical examinations, foster-care charges, and transportation expenses. Reimbursement is provided after the adoption becomes final, the child is under 18 years old and unmarried, and the appropriate application is filed. The program allows for reimbursement of adoption expenses up to $2,000 per parent if other benefits do not cover the full amount. If both parents are eligible, each can receive this amount. However, the total reimbursement cannot exceed the lesser of the total adoption expenses or $5,000. Guidelines will be issued for interagency cooperation to implement this program effectively. The Office of Personnel Management may issue guidelines for uniform administration of reimbursement under this section. Agencies must follow these guidelines in their regulations. The Office can provide assistance to agencies upon request to implement this section effectively. The text discusses the amendment of part III of title 5, United States Code, regarding annuities, insurance, and miscellaneous benefits. It also specifies the applicability of section 9001 to Postal Service employees and the effective date of the Act."
