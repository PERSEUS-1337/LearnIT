    "content": "Under the CRA, agencies must submit a report to Congress and the GAO before a rule can take effect, including a summary of the rule, designation of whether it is \"major,\" and proposed effective date. Major rules require additional time for Congress to review, with GAO assessing the agency's compliance. Members of Congress can use expedited procedures to overturn a rule, primarily in the Senate. Expedited procedures under the CRA allow for quick overturning of rules by Congress. A Senate committee can be discharged with a petition signed by 30 Senators. A nondebatable motion can be made to proceed with a disapproval resolution, requiring a simple majority. The resolution is subject to 10 hours of debate and a simple majority vote. No amendments are allowed. If both houses pass the resolution, it goes to the President for signature or veto. If vetoed, Congress can vote to override. If the resolution is signed or veto overridden within deadlines, the rule is deemed to have never taken effect. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for quick overturning of rules by Congress. If a rule is disapproved, the previous status quo is reinstated. The CRA covers rules issued by most executive branch entities, but excludes actions of the President. The definition of \"substantially the same\" rule is not clearly defined under the CRA. The CRA broadens the APA definition of \"rule\" but includes exceptions. It defines \"rule\" as an agency statement with future effect implementing law or policy. The term excludes rules of particular applicability. The CRA broadens the APA definition of \"rule\" but includes exceptions. It defines \"rule\" as an agency statement with future effect implementing law or policy. The term excludes rules of particular applicability. Determining whether agency action is subject to the CRA involves a two-part inquiry: first, if it qualifies as a rule under the APA definition, and second, if it falls within exceptions to the CRA's definition of rule. Courts have distinguished agency rulemaking actions from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. The CRA broadens the APA definition of \"rule\" but includes exceptions. It defines a rule as an agency statement with future effect implementing law or policy, excluding rules of particular applicability. Determining if agency action is subject to the CRA involves two inquiries: qualifying as a rule under the APA definition and falling within exceptions to the CRA's rule definition. Courts differentiate agency rulemaking from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. The CRA incorporates the APA's definition of \"rule,\" with limited case law interpreting it. The APA distinguishes between agency actions, categorizing rules, orders, and investigatory acts. Orders are final dispositions from agency adjudications, while rules result from rulemaking. Courts look beyond labels to determine if an action is a rule or an order, considering the substance of the action. Adjudications resolve specific disputes, while rulemaking affects broad classes of individuals. The APA distinguishes between agency actions, categorizing rules, orders, and investigatory acts. Adjudications resolve specific disputes, while rulemaking affects broad classes of individuals. Rulemaking has a prospective and definitive effect on individuals, while orders have an immediate impact on those involved in the dispute. Courts have noted that some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules if they meet certain criteria. The APA distinguishes between agency actions, categorizing rules, orders, and investigatory acts. Rulemaking has a prospective and definitive effect on individuals, while orders have an immediate impact on those involved in the dispute. Courts have noted that agency statements must be of general or particular applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The future effect requirement distinguishes rules from adjudications, as rules are intended to inform future conduct and have legal consequences only for the future. The APA distinguishes between agency actions, categorizing rules, orders, and investigatory acts. Rulemaking has a prospective and definitive effect on individuals, while orders have an immediate impact on those involved in the dispute. Judge Silberman argued that only agency statements that \"seek to authoritatively answer an underlying policy or legal issue\" should be considered rules under the APA. These opinions raise questions about the interpretation of the phrase \"future effect\" in the APA definition of a rule. The APA distinguishes between agency actions, categorizing rules, orders, and investigatory acts. Rulemaking has a prospective and definitive effect on individuals. To distinguish between \"legislative\" and \"interpretive\" rules, courts consider whether a rule has \"the force of law\" or is \"legally binding.\" The \"legal effect\" test for notice-and-comment rulemaking may be equivalent to asking whether a rule binds an agency. The \"future effect\" inquiry tests whether an agency action is a \"rule\" under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4), while the \"legal effect\" inquiry tests whether such a rule is subject to notice-and-comment procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7553. These tests are tied to distinct statutory provisions and should not both turn on whether a rule is legally binding. The APA distinguishes between agency actions, categorizing rules, orders, and investigatory acts based on their legal effect. Agency actions must be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy to be considered rules under the APA. The D.C. Circuit has clarified that agency documents that merely restate existing law or do not change any law or policy are not considered rules. The APA outlines specific rulemaking procedures that agencies must follow, including publication in the Federal Register and procedural requirements. The APA distinguishes agency actions as rules, orders, or investigatory acts based on their legal effect. Rulemaking procedures, including publication in the Federal Register and notice-and-comment requirements, are necessary for most agency rules. However, certain agency acts like interpretative rules or general policy statements may not require notice-and-comment rulemaking. Courts often exempt agency guidance documents from APA rulemaking procedures, classifying them as interpretative rules or general policy statements. Interpretive rules and general policy statements do not impose new obligations or prohibitions but explain existing legal obligations or describe how an agency will exercise its enforcement discretion. The key factor distinguishing them from legislative rules is whether they bind private parties or the agency itself with the force of law. General policy statements are not legally binding and do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Some cases suggest that general policy statements may not be considered rules under the APA definition. The APA distinguishes between interpretive rules, general policy statements, and legislative rules based on whether they bind private parties or the agency itself with the force of law. Some courts have held that general policy statements may not qualify as APA \"rules\" if they do not have a \"future effect\" or bind the agency. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" and may incorporate judicial interpretations of that definition. The CRA distinguishes between rules and orders, with rules being subject to CRA requirements. Some debate exists on whether guidance documents qualify as CRA \"rules,\" as the term is not defined under the CRA or APA. Agency statements labeled as guidance may still qualify as a \"rule\" under the CRA, depending on whether they fall within the statutory definition and any exceptions. While guidance documents are often exempt from APA rulemaking procedures, they may still be subject to the CRA. The CRA distinguishes between rules and orders, with rules being subject to CRA requirements. Agency guidance documents that are exempt from APA's notice-and-comment procedures may still be subject to the CRA, depending on the statutory definition and exceptions. The CRA may encompass some agency statements not subject to APA's rulemaking requirements. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) in 1996 intended to cover a broad range of agency activities, including policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain organizational rules, despite not being subject to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements. There is ambiguity regarding whether non-binding statements are considered rules under the APA definition. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) covers a broad range of agency activities, including policy statements and interpretive rules. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has concluded that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. The CRA exempts certain rules from its definition, such as rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel rules, and rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The CRA does not apply to rules concerning monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors. The CRA does not apply to rules concerning monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. It also contains exceptions for rules related to hunting, fishing, or camping activities. The CRA allows agencies to determine when a rule takes effect, despite its requirements. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specific parties. The GAO has clarified that a rule does not need to apply to the entire population to be considered generally applicable under the CRA. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, which are directed at specific parties. The GAO clarified that a rule does not need to apply to the entire population to be considered generally applicable under the CRA. Examples of rules of particular applicability include those related to rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, mergers, acquisitions, and accounting practices. The APA and CRA have exemptions for rules of particular applicability, such as agency actions and management policies. The APA exemption covers internal matters not affecting outside parties, while the CRA's exemption is for rules related to agency management or personnel. It is uncertain if the substantial-effect requirement from the APA applies to the CRA. The CRA's second exemption, for \"any rule relating to agency management or personnel,\" may be interpreted more broadly than the APA exception due to the lack of a substantial-effect requirement. Congress may have intentionally omitted this limitation to exclude rules regardless of their impact on third parties. This contrasts with the third exemption, which does include a substantial-effect requirement. The difference in phrasing suggests that Congress may have intended for the second exemption to be interpreted differently. The APA excludes certain agency rules from notice-and-comment procedures, including those related to agency organization and procedures. Courts have interpreted this exemption to exclude rules that substantially affect non-agency parties. However, the impact on third parties is not the sole factor in determining if a rule is substantive or procedural. The D.C. Circuit has developed the \"substantial impact test\" to determine if agency rules should be excluded from notice-and-comment procedures under the CRA. This test considers whether the rule substantially impacts the regulated industry and encodes a substantive value judgment. The focus is on the effect of the rule on the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The D.C. Circuit's \"substantial impact test\" determines if agency rules should be excluded from notice-and-comment procedures under the CRA based on their effect on non-agency parties. The test focuses on rules with a truly minor, incidental effect on non-agency parties. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect, including rules promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. The agency is required to submit a report to Congress and the Comptroller General along with the rule, including a concise statement, proposed effective date, and information on cost-benefit analysis. For major rules, additional information is needed for compliance assessment by GAO, to be included in the major rule report. The report must be submitted to the House and Senate committees within 15 days of rule submission or publication in the Federal Register. Agencies typically use a two-page form to provide the required information. In FY1999, Congress mandated OMB to create a standard form for agencies to report major rules. The form was issued in March 1999 as part of guidance on CRA compliance. Submission of rules to Congress triggers expedited procedures under the CRA for Members to consider a resolution of disapproval. Congressional receipt and referral notices are published in the Congressional Record and on Congress.gov. GAO notes receipt of rules in a database on their website. The CRA's expedited procedures for introducing and considering a joint resolution disapproving a rule are triggered when the rule is received in Congress. Concerns have been raised about agencies not submitting their rules, leading to non-compliance with the submission requirement. In 1998, Congress required OMB to issue guidance to improve agency compliance with the CRA. The Lew memorandum issued by then-OMB Director Jacob J. Lew in March 1999 provided guidance to agencies on where to send their rules in Congress, including addresses and offices in the House and Senate. GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance with the submission requirement by comparing final rules published in the Federal Register with those submitted to GAO. This monitoring was done voluntarily by GAO to ensure accuracy in data and compliance with the Congressional Review Act. The GAO reviewed agency compliance with submission requirements for rules published in the Federal Register. GAO found that some rules were not submitted as required by the statute. GAO recommended that OIRA play a more proactive role in ensuring agency compliance. GAO continued to monitor agency submissions until 2012. In 2012, GAO stopped sending lists of rules not received by OIRA due to resource constraints. They now only track major rules not received, not all final rules. Agencies generally submit rules to Congress and GAO, but non notice-and-comment rules are often not submitted. GAO's tracking methodology did not capture all required agency actions. Comparing regulations in the Federal Register to those received under the CRA was GAO's reference point. The Federal Register contains rules subject to the CRA, but many agency actions not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not published or submitted to GAO. This led to undetected noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement, especially for rules outside the rulemaking process. The practical difficulty of submitting numerous agency statements as rules under the CRA contributes to this noncompliance. The CRA's submission requirement includes a wide range of agency statements that qualify as rules. Agencies take numerous actions annually that could fall under the CRA's definition of a rule, potentially overwhelming Congress and the GAO with filings. Despite the unlikelihood of resolutions of disapproval, the accompanying documents for data analysis and tracking proposed by the GAO would incur significant costs. Many agencies may be unaware of the extent of the requirement. Many agencies may be unaware of the breadth of the CRA's coverage, leading to potential challenges in Congress's ability to use the CRA effectively. For example, in a 2012 opinion, the GAO disagreed with the Department of Health and Human Services' assertion that guidance documents are not subject to the CRA's submission requirement. This lack of awareness could hinder Congress's oversight of agency actions. The Senate has developed a practice to use the CRA's review mechanism even when an agency does not submit a rule for review. Members of Congress have sought GAO opinions on whether certain agency actions should have been submitted under the CRA. GAO has issued 21 opinions, defining \"rule\" expansively, with 11 opinions stating that agency statements should have been submitted for review. In recent years, the Senate has considered using GAO opinions to trigger the initiation period for submitting a disapproval resolution under the CRA. GAO plays a crucial role in determining the applicability of the CRA by issuing opinions on agency actions. The history of the CRA's implementation suggests that GAO's role in this regard is significant, even though it is not explicitly outlined in the statute. The GAO's role in determining whether an agency action is a \"rule\" is linked to its activities under the CRA. GAO's primary duty is to report on major rules to Congress, but it also voluntarily created a database for non-major rules to assist Congress and the public. The GAO receives 15-20 rules on average each day, which can be searched for by various elements on their website. GAO's determination of whether agency actions are considered \"rules\" under the CRA is closely linked to monitoring agency compliance. GAO's role in determining if agency actions are rules was highlighted in a congressional hearing on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997. The GAO's general counsel testified at a hearing regarding the applicability of the CRA to the Tongass Land Management Plan. Former Senator Larry Craig questioned the GAO's role in advising Congress and agencies on policy decisions as rules under the CRA. GAO's general counsel stated that the CRA does not specify who decides what constitutes a rule, unlike major rule determinations assigned to other entities. The GAO issued opinions on the applicability of the CRA, but Congress's response varied over time. In 2008, GAO stated that a letter from CMS regarding SCHIP was a rule. In response to a letter from state health officials regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, Senator John D. Rockefeller introduced S.J.Res. 44 to disapprove the guidance. The Committee on Finance did not take further action on the resolution due to missing the window for expedited procedures under the CRA. The House and Senate took action on resolutions of disapproval in 2012 and 2018, respectively, overturning guidance from different government agencies. The House passed S.J.Res. 57 on May 8, 2018, and the President signed it into law on May 21, 2018. GAO opinions on whether agency actions are covered by the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect. However, the Senate has treated GAO opinions as decisive, leading to the enactment of joint resolutions of disapproval based on GAO determinations. The GAO opinions have been used by Congress to trigger statutory provisions when agencies fail to submit rules under the CRA. This allows for congressional review of rules that should have been submitted. The CRA provision prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability under the CRA. Most courts have declined to review claims about agency actions under the CRA, leaving the resolution of such issues to the political arena. The provision barring judicial review may also address whether a rule has taken effect through GAO opinions, as agencies must submit rules to Congress before they become operative. Courts have refrained from adjudicating on this matter. Courts have generally refused to review claims under the CRA regarding agency actions. The provision prohibiting judicial review addresses whether a rule has taken effect through GAO opinions, as agencies must submit rules to Congress before they become operative. It is unlikely that a court would enforce a provision declaring a rule ineffective for not being submitted to Congress. The CRA requires agencies to submit some rules that inherently lack legal effect. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules that lack legal effect. Some courts have held that the CRA suspends a rule's operation even if it technically became effective. GAO has issued opinions on whether certain agency actions are eligible for disapproval under the CRA, focusing on exceptions to the definition of \"rule.\" The Emergency Sale Timber Program was enacted to increase salvage timber sales for forest health. A memorandum from the Secretary of Agriculture regarding the program was deemed a rule under the CRA by GAO. The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service issued the Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, which GAO determined to be a rule under the CRA. President Clinton's Executive Order 13061 for the American Heritage River Initiative was not considered a rule under the CRA. On February 5, 1998, the EPA issued guidance updating its framework for complaints alleging discrimination in environmental permitting. GAO determined that the guidance affected non-agency parties' rights and was considered a rule under the CRA. On May 3, 2000, the FCA issued a booklet providing guidance on the national charter application process and territory, which GAO also concluded met the requirements of a legislative rule. The GAO determined that the Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) and the FCA booklet met the requirements of legislative rules under the CRA, as they both had significant effects on non-agency parties and established policies for the future. The ROD aimed to restore and maintain anadromous fish in the Trinity River, while the FCA booklet provided guidance on national charter applications. On July 18, 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum to network directors regarding marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system, directing them to stop certain enrollment activities. The GAO concluded that the memorandum did not fall under the CRA as it was considered a statement of agency procedure. On January 23, 2003, the VA terminated the Vendee Loan Program in a memorandum. The VA Secretary announced the end of financing for the sale of acquired properties in a memorandum to directors and loan guarantee officers. GAO determined the memorandum did not fall under the CRA as it related to agency management. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter on SCHIP requirements to state health officials. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that a letter regarding SCHIP coverage and an information memorandum on TANF program waivers were considered rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) due to their general applicability and future effect in implementing policy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that a memorandum on TANF program waivers was considered a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) because it had general applicability and future effect in implementing policy. The Environmental Protection Agency also issued a proposed rule on greenhouse gas emissions from new stationary sources, which GAO concluded was not covered by the CRA as it was not a final rule. The GAO determined that the interagency guidance on leveraged lending issued by multiple financial regulatory agencies was considered a rule under the CRA due to its general policy implications and future effects. The GAO concluded that an amendment to the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service was considered a rule under the CRA due to its substantial impact on the regulated community. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management issued resource management plans for four areas in Alaska in December 2016. The plans are required under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and are considered rules under the CRA. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin on \"Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\" on March 21, 2013. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's bulletin on indirect auto lenders' compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). President Trump's policy on global health assistance funding, known as the \"Mexico City Policy,\" prohibits assistance to foreign entities that promote abortion as a method of family planning. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that agency actions by USAID and the U.S. Agency for International Development implementing President Trump's policy decision were not considered rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) due to the broad policymaking authority granted to the President in the area of foreign affairs. This decision was based on a 1989 D.C. Circuit case which held that such actions were not reviewable under the APA as they involved policy-making at the highest level by the executive branch. The IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed tax returns without ACA reporting requirements. GAO determined this was not a rule under the CRA as it only changed the timing of compliance measures. The SSA's HALLEX manual describes how disability benefit claims are processed under the Social Security Act. The SSA's HALLEX manual outlines procedures for adjudicating disability benefit claims under the Social Security Act. GAO determined that certain sections of the manual regarding the use of internet information are procedural rules exempt from the CRA. Additionally, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38, modifying reporting requirements for tax-exempt entities, which was submitted to Congress under the CRA for review. The IRS submitted a rule under the CRA, but later argued it was not covered by the CRA, seeking GAO opinion. GAO focused on CRA timelines trigger rather than rule definition, stating its purpose is to ensure agency submissions for Congressional review. The GAO confirmed that the IRS revenue procedure was available for congressional review under the CRA because the IRS had already submitted it, triggering Congress's oversight powers. The GAO also stated that the April 2018 memorandum on illegal border crossings was not a rule under the CRA as it pertained to agency organization, procedure, or practice, and did not change individuals' rights or obligations. The GAO concluded that a memorandum justifying the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census was not considered a rule under the CRA, as it was direction from a supervisor to a subordinate in conjunction with the statutory process of informing Congress of census questions. The GAO determined that a memorandum justifying the inclusion of a citizenship question in the 2020 census did not meet the CRA's definition of a rule as it was not intended to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."
