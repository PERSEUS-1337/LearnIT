    "content": "A helper in the construction industry is typically an unskilled worker who assists skilled craftsmen. They may have a range of skills but lack formal training. Helpers are often not union members and are paid less than skilled workers, but can still perform well in certain tasks. They are valued for their lower cost and flexibility in taking on various types of work. The debate over craft fragmentation in the construction industry revolves around the use of helpers and apprentices. Helpers are considered temporary workers with minimal training, while apprentices receive formal on-the-job and outside instruction. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices in wage rate classifications but not helpers, to maintain the prevailing wage structure and skills system. The Davis-Bacon Act (1931, as amended) requires construction contracts over $2,000 to include minimum wages based on prevailing rates for laborers and mechanics. The Secretary of Labor determines these rates, leading to debates and litigation over concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing.\" The Davis-Bacon Act has been a focus of contention for over 60 years, with debates over the concept of \"helper\" and whether their use is common in federal construction projects. Congress legislated broadly, referring to \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" without mentioning helpers or other skill groups. The Secretary of Labor was tasked with defining these terms, focusing on apprentices and trainees in formal programs. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a source of debate for over 60 years, particularly regarding the classification of \"helper\" in federal construction projects. The regulations lacked a precise definition of helpers, leading to confusion in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot highlighted the need for clear definitions in the regulations, noting that some firms had to reclassify helpers as journeymen or laborers to comply with prevailing wage determinations. Thieblot also mentioned the desire of firms to use semi-skilled labor for certain tasks, but without proper classification, this was challenging. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a source of debate for over 60 years, particularly regarding the classification of \"helper\" in federal construction projects. The regulations lacked a precise definition of helpers, leading to confusion in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot highlighted the need for clear definitions in the regulations, noting that some firms had to reclassify helpers as journeymen or laborers to comply with prevailing wage determinations. Thieblot also mentioned the desire of firms to use semi-skilled labor for certain tasks, but without proper classification, this was challenging. According to DOL regulations, unless workers are enrolled in a formal apprenticeship program, they must be considered journeymen for pay purposes. Helpers are only recognized for Davis-Bacon rate purposes in areas where their classification is prevalent due to the dominance of open shop firms. Trade unionists view DOL's restrictions on employing apprentices, trainees, or helpers at sub-craft rates as essential for maintaining labor standards in the building trades. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, recognizes apprentices and trainees approved by the Department of Labor (DOL) as causing few issues. However, informal titles like \"helper\" and \"trainee\" have led to conflicts. The use of helpers at sub-craft wages was seen as a way for non-union contractors to undercut prevailing wage rates on federally funded projects, going against the intent of the Davis-Bacon Act. By the late 1970s, there was a push for reform or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act through direct legislation or regulatory changes. In late December 1979, the Carter Administration proposed a rule revising the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act, focusing on the classification and wage rates for laborers and mechanics. The rule aimed to establish criteria for designating special wage rates for helpers based on their distinct duties in the area of work. The Carter Administration proposed a rule in late December 1979 to revise the Davis-Bacon Act, focusing on wage rates for laborers and mechanics. The rule aimed to establish criteria for special wage rates for helpers based on their distinct duties in the proposed work area. In mid-January 1981, a final rule was published, addressing concerns about denying job opportunities to youths, minorities, and women by only permitting employment of apprentices and trainees under approved programs. The Department stressed the importance of recognized apprenticeship and training programs to ensure genuine training and avoid locking workers into low-paying unskilled jobs. The Department of Labor made exceptions to the Davis-Bacon Act requirements, defining terms like apprentice and trainee but not helper. Wage determinations were based on work performed, not skill levels. The Department faced difficulties in recognizing helpers and determining prevailing wage rates. The Reagan Administration delayed and withdrew Davis-Bacon regulations for further review in February 1981. The helper issue during the Reagan era was considered in three periods: issuance of a proposed rule in August 1981. During the Reagan era, the Department of Labor proposed a new rule for the Davis-Bacon Act in August 1981, allowing for a helper classification on wage determinations. The proposal aimed to reflect actual classification practices in the construction industry by issuing helper wage determinations when identifiable in the locality, not just when prevailing as before. The regulation defined helper broadly and permitted a ratio of one helper to five journeymen to prevent abuse. The Department of Labor proposed a new rule for the Davis-Bacon Act during the Reagan era, allowing for a helper classification on wage determinations. The regulation defined a helper as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman, with a ratio of one helper to five journeymen to prevent abuse. The Department of Labor issued a final rule in May 1995 regarding the use of helpers in construction. The new standard increased the ratio of helpers to journeymen from 1:5 to 2:3, allowing up to 40% of the workforce to be helpers. This change was made to better reflect the diversity in construction practices and localities, resulting in substantial cost savings. The final rule issued by the Department of Labor in May 1995 increased the ratio of helpers to journeymen from 1:5 to 2:3, allowing up to 40% of the workforce to be helpers. The reaction to the rule was divided, with critics like John Dunlop calling the helper ratio \"categorically wrong\" and the Building and Construction Trades Department expressing concerns about the unlimited use of helpers. Industry, however, welcomed the change, citing projected cost savings. The American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the Reagan administration's revision of Davis-Bacon regulations, allowing contractors to use more semi-skilled workers at lower wages. The AFL-CIO expressed concerns about the new helper classification, stating it could lead to wage-cutting and misclassification. They filed a lawsuit in early June to challenge the changes. In early June, the AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to challenge the Reagan administration's revision of Davis-Bacon regulations, specifically addressing concerns about the new helper classification. Judge Harold H. Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor, highlighting the historical context of worker classification to prevent wage-cutting practices. The AFL-CIO challenged the Reagan administration's revision of Davis-Bacon regulations, focusing on the new helper classification. Judge Harold H. Greene issued an injunction against the Secretary of Labor, emphasizing the importance of worker classification to prevent wage-cutting practices. The new regulations allow helpers to perform various tasks across different trades, deviating from the traditional classification system based on historical recognition and well-defined tasks. The AFL-CIO challenged the Reagan administration's revision of Davis-Bacon regulations, focusing on the new helper classification. The regulations allow helpers to perform tasks across different trades, potentially leading to wage-cutting practices. The Wage Appeals Board expressed concerns about contractors reclassifying work to pay lower wages, undermining the Davis-Bacon Act. The AFL-CIO challenged the Reagan administration's revision of Davis-Bacon regulations, particularly the new helper classification allowing helpers to work across trades, potentially leading to wage-cutting practices. Judge Greene noted the significant departure from prior interpretations and issued a permanent injunction against the regulations. Judge Greene issued a permanent injunction against the helper rule, which was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Appeals Court partly upheld and partly overturned the District Court verdict, stating that the provision allowing a helper classification to be 'identifiable' must be struck down as it undermines the act's purpose of mirroring local wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court also highlighted the potential for downgrading work classifications and reducing wages, noting that Congress viewed underclassification as contrary to the act's goals. The Appeals Court upheld Judge Greene's decision to strike down the provision allowing a helper classification to be 'identifiable' but accepted the Secretary's new definition of \"helper.\" The unions appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, leaving the Appeals Court's decision in place. The Appeals Court upheld Judge Greene's decision to strike down the provision allowing a helper classification to be 'identifiable.' The Secretary of Labor had to restructure the helper regulation to comply with the court's ruling. The Department issued a new proposed rule on the use of helpers, addressing the issue of \"prevailing\" classification. After revisions, the final rule was published in 1989 but had to be cleared through the District Court due to the 1982 injunction. Judge Greene vacated the injunction in 1990, allowing the Department of Labor to implement the rule. On September 24, 1990, Judge Greene vacated the injunction, allowing DOL to implement the helper regulation. Building trades unions filed an appeal on October 2, 1990. The Department notified that the helper rule would take effect on February 4, 1991, and contractors were asked to report helper, apprentice, and trainee details. Congress intervened with a bill in April 1991, prohibiting DOL from implementing the regulation. BCTD President urged Labor Secretary to withhold implementation until the judicial appeal was completed. DOL's funding request for FY1992 to implement the helper regulation was denied. The DOL's FY1992 budget request to implement the helper regulation was denied by Congress. The Appeals Court upheld the definition of \"helper\" and \"prevailing\" but deemed the ratio of helpers to journeymen as \"arbitrary and capricious,\" leading to its invalidation. The court criticized the lack of rational decision-making in setting the ratio and sent the matter back to the Department for review. The DOL issued a new final Davis-Bacon rule in June 1992, removing the ratio of helpers to journeymen. This decision was seen as a blow to building trades unions but a victory for industry critics. Debate continued on the wisdom of the helper regulation and its effects on manpower utilization and costs. Major revision or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act through legislation was not a viable option, leading to ongoing reform discussions. Efforts to reform the Davis-Bacon regulations through legislation were considered, but the rulemaking process was seen as a more likely approach. However, rulemaking did not offer a permanent solution as different administrations could reverse the changes. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to amend the act by adding the classification of \"helper\" to workers, but the proposal was not adopted. Despite ongoing efforts to codify the regulations, the issue of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects resurfaced in 1993. Senator Nickles and Senator Craig proposed deleting language blocking the use of helpers on such projects in the Department of Labor Appropriations Act of 1994. Senator Nickles proposed regulations allowing the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects to save the government money and create job opportunities. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, citing concerns about its impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs. The Senate committee passed an amendment to suspend the implementation of DOL's helper regulations for one year, despite objections from Senator Harkin. The House Appropriations Committee later defeated a proposal to remove the helper funding restraint from a pending DOL appropriations measure. Representative DeLay argued for the implementation of the helper regulation to reduce construction costs and create more job opportunities, while Representative Ford argued that the Davis-Bacon requirement protects wages and benefits in local communities. Representative Ford argued that the Davis-Bacon requirement protects wages and benefits in local communities, ensures quality construction, and saves money in the long run. He expressed concerns that implementing the helper regulations would undermine apprenticeship training programs and create low-skilled, low-paying jobs. Despite efforts to amend the Davis-Bacon Act, the DeLay amendment to suspend the helper regulations was defeated, retaining the language prohibiting their implementation in the bill. During the 104th Congress, there were efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act through legislation introduced in both the Senate and the House. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 calling for repeal, while Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 with the same purpose. The bills were referred to committees and faced party-line votes before being reported for further consideration. The repeal legislation continued to be discussed throughout the summer and fall of 1995. During the 104th Congress, efforts were made to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act through legislation introduced in both the Senate and the House. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 for repeal, while Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 with the same purpose. Additional measures were introduced by Hatfield and Weldon as a compromise, focusing on reform rather than repeal. The bills aimed at comprehensive revisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The Hatfield/Weldon legislation, along with earlier bills introduced by Kassebaum and Ballenger, did not address the technical issues related to helper classifications under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Department suspended the helper regulation in November 1993, and the spending prohibition continued until mid-fiscal 1996. However, no prohibition was imposed for the latter half of fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1997. In June 1996, it was noted that there were no statutory obstacles to enforcing the revised helper regulations. The Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) sued the Department to enforce revised helper regulations, citing a cost of over $500 million per year to taxpayers. The Department deemed the current helper regulation unenforceable due to unclear distinctions between helpers and other workers. The Department stated its intention not to implement the regulation in its current form. The Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated a helper regulation, which has been suspended for over four years. The Department now believes that additional information warrants a review of the rule, as data shows that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as previously thought. There are concerns that the regulation could lead to abuse of the helper classification to justify lower wages. The Department of Labor (DOL) has suspended the helper regulation for over four years due to concerns about potential abuse of the classification to justify lower wages. DOL is reexamining the regulation's basis and impact, seeking public comments for substantive rulemaking on the issue. The Department of Labor received 47 submissions from industry and trade groups regarding the interim suspension of the helper rule. The Building and Construction Trades Department agreed with the suspension, while the Associated General Contractors disagreed, suggesting a quicker implementation process. DOL argued that implementing the rule would take longer than 60 days based on past experience. The Department of Labor received feedback on the suspension of the helper rule, with industry groups expressing differing opinions. The rule would have a 60-day effective date for compliance and only apply to contracts advertised or negotiated after that date. Changes to procurement regulations and contract forms would be necessary, potentially taking several months. Contractors can use helpers if the contract includes a wage determination with a helper classification or if the contractor requests a helper classification and it is deemed a prevailing practice in the area. The Department of Labor intends to complete a substantive rulemaking action within a year, leading to the suspension of the helper regulation. Feedback received did not change the Department's decision to continue the suspension. The Department has not decided to repeal or amend the regulations regarding the use of helpers. The Department of Labor is reexamining the semi-skilled helper regulations due to concerns about their impact and potential abuse. New data suggests that helper utilization may not be as widespread as initially thought, and the administration of the regulation could be challenging. The Department is also worried about the regulation's effect on formal apprenticeship and training programs. While willing to explore private sector helper utilization further, the potential for abuse remains a significant issue. The Department of Labor is reevaluating the helper classification, which is based on subjective standards, making enforcement challenging. Critics are concerned about the impact on apprenticeship programs, as lower wages for helpers could discourage contractor participation in training programs. This could lead to shortages in the industry and threaten private funding for training. The Department of Labor is reevaluating the helper classification due to concerns about its impact on industry and individual workers. Divergent opinions exist on the role of helpers, with some seeing it as an entry-level opportunity and others as a pre-apprentice option. The Department has suspended the helper regulation pending further rulemaking to better understand the helper/apprentice relationship. The Department of Labor suspended helper regulations in 1993 due to a spending ban by Congress. In 1997, a court ruled that the suspension was valid even after the spending ban expired in 1996. The court disagreed with the argument that the regulations had to be implemented once the ban ended. Judge Sporkin disagreed with the argument that the Department of Labor was bound to implement the suspended helper regulations once the spending ban expired. He noted that new data collected during the suspension raised doubts about the cost-savings projected by the regulations, indicating a need for review and potential changes. Judge Sporkin reviewed the contentions of each side regarding the Department of Labor's decision to seek an indefinite postponement of the effective date for helper regulations. The plaintiffs focused on the substance of the regulations rather than procedural issues, offering little evidence that the delays were arbitrary. The court found that the Department's rationale for re-examining the regulations was justified. The court ruled in favor of the Department of Labor, suspending the helper regulations indefinitely. A new proposed rule was published in the Federal Register, reinstating the Department's policy on helpers for Davis-Bacon projects. The rule would allow helpers only if their duties are distinct from journeymen, it's a prevailing practice, and not synonymous with trainees. The Department of Labor's initiatives on helper regulations faced challenges in court and from Congress. After years of analysis, it was found that the suspended rule may not be enforceable, the use of helpers in the private sector is not as widespread as thought, and implementing the rule could negatively impact apprenticeship and training opportunities. The findings under the Clinton Administration differed from those of previous administrations. The Clinton Administration decided to revert to pre-1980s practice regarding the suspended regulation on helper definitions. The Department of Labor found the earlier rule's definition of \"helper\" to be internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from a general laborer. Wage and Hour struggled with identifying semi-skilled workers and determining the line between semi-skilled and skilled journeyworkers. The Department of Labor analyzed the provisions of the suspended rule regarding the distinction between semi-skilled helpers and skilled workers. They argued that the definition provided little guidance in distinguishing between the two categories, leading to overlap in duties. The Department of Labor found that the suspended rule had difficulty in distinguishing between helpers and laborers due to significant overlap in duties. The term \"helper\" had multiple meanings in the construction industry, making it challenging to conduct a meaningful wage determination process. The assumption that the use of helpers was widespread was deemed to be in error or overstated. Survey data during litigation showed that the Department believed the use of helpers was lower than previously thought. The Department emphasized the effectiveness of formal apprenticeship training programs in producing skilled and productive workers. Encouraging training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, including women and minorities, was a key objective. The Department was concerned that suspending helper regulations could hinder effective industry training. The Department believes that suspending helper regulations could hinder effective industry training by potentially replacing apprentices and trainees with helpers who may not advance to journey-level workers. Legislation was introduced to establish helpers as a separate worker classification under the Davis-Bacon Act, but no action was taken. Representative Norwood reintroduced the proposal in the 106th Congress. The bill introduced in March 1999 aimed to establish helpers as a separate worker classification under the Davis-Bacon Act. However, the Department of Labor (DOL) found the language imprecise and burdensome, leading to the issuance of a final rule in November 2000 regarding the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The Department of Labor amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers under the Davis-Bacon Act. The regulation took effect in January 2001, with the Department explaining why previous proposed regulations would not work effectively. The AFL-CIO and industry spokespersons had differing opinions on the matter. The Department of Labor amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers under the Davis-Bacon Act. The amended rule ensures that helpers are paid the prevailing rate for their work based on the duties they perform, preventing them from overlapping with other classifications and undermining the prevailing wage structure. The Department cited vague criteria in the previous proposed rule as a reason for the change in policy. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the difficulty in distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in the construction market, stating that skilled craft workers often perform a range of duties. They also highlighted the challenges of defining supervision on a construction site and the ambiguities in the suspended rule. The Department was worried that contractors would interpret the term \"helpers\" differently, making wage determination challenging. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University raised concerns about the impact of a suspended rule on enforcement and administration, emphasizing the productivity and cost-saving benefits. The Department of Labor argued that regulations must be administered in line with the goals of the statute to protect prevailing wages, not to secure the cheapest labor. Additionally, the Department found that helpers are used less widely than previously thought. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in construction was much lower than previously assumed, with only 3.9% of classifications using helpers. This contradicted earlier estimates and projections, leading to concerns about the impact on apprenticeship and training programs. The Department of Labor expressed concerns that allowing contractors to use low-wage helpers instead of apprentices in formal training programs could undermine effective training in the construction industry. Building trades unions argued that this practice would disadvantage contractors supporting formal apprenticeship programs and lead to a shortage of skilled craft workers. Employers disputed these claims, stating that there was no basis for the Department's concerns. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the use of low-wage helpers instead of apprentices in formal training programs in the construction industry. Employers disagreed, stating there was no basis for the Department's concerns. The final rule restored the definition of helper to its original meaning, aiming to prevent the undermining of formal apprenticeship and training programs on Davis-Bacon projects. At the beginning of the 21st century, the last outstanding rule from the Reagan Administration regarding the classification of \"helper\" in wage determinations for construction projects was addressed. Interest in restructuring the regulation continued in Congress, with Representative Norwood introducing legislation on the issue. No action was taken on the proposal in the 107th Congress, but on June 2, 2003, in the 108th Congress, the issue was revisited. In the 108th Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn introduced H.R. 2283, the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act,\" which aimed to classify helpers as a separate category for Davis-Bacon purposes and ensure they are paid prevailing wages. The bill defined a helper as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman in specified tasks. The proposal did not progress beyond the Committee on Education and the Workforce. In the 109th Congress, Representatives Blackburn and Norwood reintroduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" (H.R. 3907), but no action was taken on the measure. The issue of helpers did not resurface in the 110th Congress, while the Davis-Bacon Act continued to be a focus of public policy debate. The act underwent substantive review in the 1960s and saw an expansion of prevailing wage in 1964. Further review occurred in the late 1970s during the Carter Administration. In the final days of the Carter Presidency and into the Reagan Administration, regulations regarding helpers on Davis-Bacon construction were proposed, litigated, and ultimately suspended in December 1996. The Department of Labor declared the regulation \"non-administrable\" and reverted to the late 1970s status quo. In December 1996, the Reagan Administration suspended the helper regulation due to new evidence. The Department of Labor published a new proposed rule in April 1999, reinstating the longstanding practice with helpers. The final helper rule was published on November 20, 2000, taking effect on January 19, 2001. This process spanned over 2 decades and had never been fully implemented. The Department of Labor defended various versions of administrative reforms between 1981 and 1993, but later became critical of its efforts. In April 1999, a new rule reverted to the 1970s practice regarding helpers. The DOL largely rejected its helper policy from the 1980s and 1990s with a final rule in November 2000. Congress debated the \"helper\" issue and introduced legislation in the 109th Congress, but the bill did not pass. The issue has not resurfaced in the 110th Congress."
