    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". The Congress finds that increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline for vehicles requires ensuring it won't harm emission control systems or engine performance. Concerns exist about the potential negative effects on engine performance, consumer complaints, and interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels exceeding the current ethanol blending limit in gasoline to warn consumers of potential harm to vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing on newer vehicles to assess the impact of increased ethanol blending, but data is lacking for older vehicles and nonroad engines. The executive branch has the authority to raise the blending limit and is in the process of making a decision. Congress should address any negative effects on interstate commerce. The potential effects on interstate commerce from a Federal decision to increase the ethanol blending limit in gasoline. SEC. 3. TARGETED LIABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR CLAIMS RELATED TO ETHANOL IN FUEL. Liability Protections: Covered entities are immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law for claims related to the use of renewable fuel containing ethanol in concentrations greater than 10 percent in internal combustion engines. Loss includes death, injury, illness, fear of injury, and property damage. The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss related to the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines, excluding certain exceptions. Persons covered under this section have the right to file a Federal cause of action against a covered person for death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct. The action can be brought for wrongful death or serious physical injury by the injured person or their representative. The lawsuit must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and the governing law will be based on the state where the injury occurred. In an action under this section, the complaint must plead each element of the plaintiff's claim with particularity, including the alleged willful misconduct, facts supporting causation of the injury, and proof of death or serious physical injury. The complaint must also include a verification by affidavit of the plaintiff stating the truth of the pleading. In an action under this section, the plaintiff must prove willful misconduct by each covered person sued with clear and convincing evidence. The case will be initially assigned to a three-judge panel for consideration of motions to dismiss or summary judgment. In actions under this section, a three-judge panel considers motions to dismiss or summary judgment. If motions are denied or time expires, the chief judge assigns the action for further proceedings, including trial. Civil discovery is not allowed until after motions are ruled on, and the plaintiff must prove willful misconduct with clear and convincing evidence. In actions under this section, civil discovery is permitted only for matters directly related to contested issues. The court will compel a response to a discovery request if it is necessary to prove or defend a material issue, balancing benefits against the burden for the responding party. Damages awarded to a plaintiff in subsection (b) actions will be reduced by collateral source benefits received. Noneconomic damages can only be awarded in limited amounts. In subsection (b), noneconomic damages are awarded in proportion to the defendant's responsibility for harm to the plaintiff. These damages cover physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, society, companionship, consortium, reputation, and other nonpecuniary losses. Rule 11 sanctions are imposed by a district court for violations in civil actions under subsection (b), including payment of expenses and attorney's fees. The text discusses sanctions for violations in civil actions, including attorney's fees, to deter repeat conduct. It also mentions the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for interlocutory appeals and the exclusion for regulated activities under the Clean Air Act. The section discusses enforcement actions by the EPA and Attorney General, staying proceedings during enforcement actions, and clarifies that it does not limit the rights or remedies of the United States. It also defines a \"covered entity\" as a key term. The term \"covered entity\" refers to an entity involved in the production, sale, or distribution of fuel or products using renewable fuel. An \"enforcement action\" includes various legal proceedings such as criminal prosecution, injunctions, and product recalls. A \"covered remedy\" is a final outcome like a criminal conviction or civil monetary payment resulting from a court or agency decision. Final terms refer to court determinations or agency actions that are not subject to further review within the agency and have not been nullified by a final court determination. Willful misconduct does not include acts taken in response to waivers of Clean Air Act requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the waiver of Clean Air Act requirements for ethanol-gasoline blends over 10% ethanol volume, defining willful misconduct as intentional, unjustified, and disregarding known risks."
