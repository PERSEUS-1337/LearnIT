    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". Congress finds that it delegated the power to regulate the value of money to the Federal Reserve System, but the value of the US dollar has fallen dramatically and become unstable. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not produced a stable and reliable value for the dollar, which hinders economic growth. An unstable dollar hinders economic growth by increasing capital costs, risks for investments, and corporate taxes. It also reduces real earnings for American workers, devalues financial assets, pension plans, and retirement accounts, and damages the US's global standing. This instability leads to anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets and the public. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed to promote stable financial markets during and after the transition. Additionally, tax depreciation is addressed. \"Entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes starting January 1, 2011. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact on Federal revenues in a present value basis. A conflict of laws provision is also included.\" SEC. 6 of the Act states that in case of conflict with the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the provisions of this Act will prevail. SEC. 7 removes the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves."
