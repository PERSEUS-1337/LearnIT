    "content": "Habeas corpus allows individuals in custody to petition for release if detention is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled on detainee rights, but has not granted relief to state prisoners claiming innocence. Legislation has been proposed to address these issues. Federal law limits habeas relief for finality, federalism, and efficiency reasons. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations on filing repetitious habeas petitions and the potential for habeas relief based on newly discovered evidence of innocence. Two bills in Congress aim to establish actual innocence as a ground for habeas relief. Representative Moore introduced one of the bills. Representative Moore introduced H.R. 3320 on July 23, 2009, while Representative Johnson introduced H.R. 3986 on November 3, 2009. The Johnson bill aimed to amend the bar on second habeas petitions to allow claims of innocence based on newly discovered evidence. The proposal included a probability standard favored by the Supreme Court in similar cases. The Johnson bill proposed changes to habeas law, allowing federal courts to consider claims of innocence based on newly discovered evidence, releasing them from state court decisions in cases of probable innocence. The Moore bill aimed to focus on innocence exceptions for second or successive habeas petitions, particularly for state prisoners seeking to establish their innocence. It would have eased restrictions on filing such petitions but maintained existing standards for barring them, requiring court approval for claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence. The Moore bill proposed changes to the requirements for second or successive habeas petitions, focusing on innocence exceptions for state prisoners. It aimed to allow for the consideration of forensic testing, exculpatory evidence, and witness testimony in support of claims of actual innocence. Additionally, it addressed the bar imposed for failure to exhaust state remedies. The 111th Congress considered various proposals related to judicial review for Guantanamo detainees, including the Military Commissions Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2009 (H.R. 64) and the Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act of 2009 (H.R. 630). In 2009, several acts were introduced by different representatives and senators regarding detainment reform and terrorist detention review. The Boumediene v. Bush case established that foreign nationals at Guantanamo had the right to habeas corpus. The Military Commissions Act and Detainee Treatment Act limited federal court jurisdiction over detainee matters, leading to concerns about the suspension of the writ. The Court's decision did not address the detainees' habeas petitions. Bills proposed in Congress aimed to repeal the Military Commissions Act's section 7 and establish new habeas provisions for enemy combatants. The 111th Congress adjourned without taking further action on these proposals. Witnesses at the House Judiciary Committee's recent habeas hearings criticized aspects of federal habeas law not addressed in legislative proposals. They raised concerns about the one-year statute of limitations and the binding effect of state court determinations on federal law. Some were critical of the \"opt in\" provisions for streamlined habeas procedures in capital cases. Chief Justice Kogan advocated for repealing these provisions to avoid confusion and inefficiency. Mr. Hanlon, Professor Blume, and Chief Justice Kogan criticized aspects of federal habeas law, including the role of gatekeepers, modification of the procedural default bar, federal funding for capital defender organizations, and suspension of federal executions for data analysis. Chief Justice Kogan also raised concerns about the Teague rule, harmless error, and deference to state fact finding in federal habeas cases. Chief Justice Kogan raised concerns about the interpretation of 'new' in habeas cases, the treatment of harmless constitutional errors at the state level, and the apparent incongruity between sections 2254(e)(1) and 2254(d)(2). The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on these matters."
