    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by the chair and ranking Member in Senate committees. This includes job titles, pay rates, and resources for staff. There is interest in congressional pay data for various reasons, but publicly available sources do not provide aggregated data. The data in this report is based on official Senate reports published semiannually. The report provides annual data on Senate committee staff compensation by fiscal year, focusing on 13 staff position titles. Titles were identified through a two-step process, with pay data collected for positions employed by at least five committees. The report focuses on Senate committee staff compensation for 13 positions, collected from committees with at least five staff members. Data includes payments for the fiscal year, including overtime and bonuses. Pay data for House committee staff and personal office staff are available in separate reports. The data presented on Senate committee staff compensation for various positions may not be fully representative due to challenges such as the large number of positions held by one employee and the way staff titles are assigned. Two categories of positions emerge, with pay information likely to be highly representative for positions usually held by one staff member per committee, while positions with potential for multiple staff members may have data that is more of a sample rather than complete. The data on Senate committee staff compensation may not fully represent all positions due to the sample nature of the data. Pay data does not consider factors like education, work experience, or job duties, which can vary even among staff with the same title. Congressional employing authorities have discretion in setting employment terms, leading to differences in duties and pay levels. Tables provide background info, comparative data, and visualizations for each position. Table 2 shows maximum payable rates for Senate committee staff since 2001 in nominal and constant 2016 dollars. Table 3 displays cumulative percentage changes in median pay for 13 positions, Members of Congress, and General Schedule salaries in Washington, DC. Tables 4-16 provide pay data for each Senate committee staff position, with graphic displays showing pay changes in nominal and constant 2016 dollars. Between FY2001 and FY2015, there were changes in median pay for various staff positions in constant 2016 dollars, ranging from increases for some positions to decreases for others. Comparisons were made to the pay changes of Members of Congress and General Schedule in Washington, DC during similar time frames. Between FY2001 and FY2015, median pay changes for staff positions ranged from a 30.88% increase for systems administrators to a -26.67% decrease for staff assistants.
