    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for private and publicly provided health care, in the form of tax expenditures, are often overlooked. Congressional attention is needed to address questions about the value and changes in health-related tax expenditures, especially in relation to the total revenue collected. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to determine the size of health tax expenditures relative to discretionary and mandatory outlays on health programs. It also examines whether federal support for health has grown more through direct outlays or indirectly through revenue losses attributable to tax expenditures. The analysis focuses on tax expenditures at the budget function level, using the definition and estimation methodology of the JCT. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from special provisions in Federal tax laws. JCT uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income and categorizes provisions by budget function. Only revenue forgone from the income tax system is included in JCT's estimates of tax expenditures, which are published during each session of Congress. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, and housing, to identify provisions with a common policy area. The Department of the Treasury also lists tax expenditures by budget function and estimates a baseline annually for the President's budget. JCT's health budget function for tax expenditures is broader than OMB's health budget functions due to historical practices and the complexity of cross-cutting provisions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzes tax expenditures based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act. The curr_chunk discusses how tax expenditures are analyzed based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures for economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, which can help in Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures in the form of exclusions and deductions may affect tax progressivity. Administrative considerations show that the tax code could be advantageous in administering social policy for lower-income households. Tax expenditures are analyzed based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures for economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity. Administering social programs through the tax code could increase tax filing complexity and costs. JCT identifies 14 health tax expenditures totaling $234.0 billion in FY2016. The largest tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance. The largest health tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), which is the largest tax expenditure in the federal tax code. From FY2015 to FY2019, the annual tax expenditure amount for ESI will increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges (advance premium tax credits, or APTCs), with an estimated increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion. These tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs and activities with positive societal benefits. Some older health tax provisions in the federal tax code have origins in legal doctrine or definitions of income at the time of adoption. For example, the ESI tax exclusion dates back to 1918 when employer payments for individual health coverage were deductible. The role of the ESI exclusion expanded significantly during and after World War II due to administrative decisions and policies that froze wages. Regulatory rulings in 1954 had conflicting outcomes on the tax treatment of employer health contributions. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 excluded employer-sponsored fringe benefits from income, including health-related contributions. JCT data from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in health tax expenditures over time. Multiple provisions are analyzed together to track changes in tax expenditures within this budget function. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures rose by 43.0% in real terms. The annual value for health-related provisions increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are estimated to reach $296.2 billion in nominal dollars. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion, with growth attributed to factors like demographic changes and policy changes affecting costs. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased over time, with JCT measuring benefits exceeding insurance payments. The annual tax expenditure value for Medicare-related provisions increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) from FY1987 to FY2014. Medicare provisions were estimated to be 26.8% of total health tax expenditures in FY2014, showing an increase from 1.9% in FY1974. Health tax expenditures have generally grown faster than total revenue collections, estimated to increase from 6.4% in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. The tax expenditure values for health-related provisions have increased from 6.4% in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue, such as the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. Additionally, a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was imposed on higher-income taxpayers. The annual revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to total health tax expenditures. Figure 3 displays discretionary and mandatory outlays, as organized under OMB's health budget function, and health-related tax expenditures as a share of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The comparison between federal health outlays and tax expenditures is useful for tracking support to the health sector. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, while research and veterans' health care are funded through discretionary spending. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were still less than health expenditures. Health-related tax expenditures have historically exceeded health discretionary outlays, but were still much less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory health outlays as a percent of GDP increased over the years, reaching 5.0% in FY2014. Health tax expenditures also grew, reaching 1.5% of GDP in FY2014. Health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The historical rationale for creating health-related tax provisions may have stemmed from past legal definitions or administrative rulings to comply with laws.
