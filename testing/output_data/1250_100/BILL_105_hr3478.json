    "content": "The \"Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998\" provides for a final settlement of the claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes by agreeing to reduced water supply facilities. The \"Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998\" defines key terms such as Agreement, Animas-la plata project, Dolores project, and Tribe. It also includes amendments to the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. After the enactment of the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998, the Secretary is required to construct a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acre-feet as part of the Animas-La Plata Project. This project also includes a pumping plant, reservoir inlet conduit, and allocations of municipal and industrial water to the Southern Ute Tribe not to exceed 16,525 acre-feet annually. The Animas-La Plata Project allocates water as follows: 16,525 acre-feet to the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe, 2,340 acre-feet to the Navajo Nation, 10,400 acre-feet to the San Juan Water Commission, and 2,600 acre-feet to the Animas-La Plata Conservancy District. Tribal construction costs are nonreimbursable, and nontribal water capital obligations are specified. Nontribal water capital obligations for the Animas-La Plata Project are to be paid by the San Juan Water Commission, Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District, and the State of Colorado. Certain nonreimbursable costs for recreation, environmental compliance, cultural resources, and fish and wildlife mitigation are specified. The Secretary shall pay the operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for tribal water allocations from the Animas-La Plata Project or the Dolores Project until the water is used by the Tribe. The Tribe is not required to reimburse these costs. Repayment of construction costs for the Dolores Project is required when the water allocation is first used by the Tribe. The Tribe is responsible for bearing a portion of the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for the Dolores Project. The Secretary will provide water allocations to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District and the La Plata Conservancy District as requested. The Secretary will transfer water rights to the New Mexico Animas-La Plata Project beneficiaries or the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission upon request of the State Engineer of New Mexico. The Interstate Stream Commission may transfer water rights to fulfill the New Mexico purposes of the Animas La-Plata Project. Certain reports from the Department of the Interior and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service are considered adequate to meet requirements under various environmental acts. The Amendments of 1998 involve the completion of construction of specific facilities and an aggregate depletion of water as approved in a biological opinion. The provision of water to the Tribes in accordance with this section constitutes final settlement of tribal claims to water rights on the Animas and La Plata Rivers. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 address water rights for Tribes on specific rivers, excluding the Animas and La Plata Rivers. The Attorney General will file necessary instruments for court approval of amendments to the final consent decree. SEC. 4. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION; TREATMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDS. The amendments made by this Act to section 6 of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement of 1988 do not affect the applicability of other provisions of the Act or the Secretary of the Interior's obligation to deliver water from the Dolores Project and complete construction of facilities on the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation as specified in various Appropriations Acts. The uncommitted portion of the cost-sharing obligation of the State of Colorado, as referenced in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988, remains available for funding components of the Animas-La Plata Project not covered in the original section."
