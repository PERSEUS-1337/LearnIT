    "title": "SB 1291",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 14717.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code requires an annual mental health plan review by an external quality review organization for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care. The review includes data on the number of children served and details on the types of mental health services provided. Access to timely mental health services, quality of services, translation and interpretation services, performance and utilization data, and medication monitoring for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care are key areas of focus. The department focuses on key areas such as follow-up care for children prescribed ADHD medication, use of multiple antipsychotics in children, first-line psychosocial care for adolescents on antipsychotics, and metabolic monitoring for children on antipsychotics. EQRO data for Medi-Cal eligible minors in foster care is reviewed and deficiencies in mental health plans are addressed. The mental health plan must submit a corrective action plan to the department within 60 days of receiving a notice. The department will review and approve the plan within 30 days and make it publicly available. Additionally, the department will share data with county boards to aid in developing mental health service plans. The department will annually provide performance outcome system data to county boards of supervisors for mental health service planning. Data will include information on youth receiving specialty mental health services, their racial and gender distribution, utilization data for various services, and unique counts of youth receiving services. The department will provide performance outcome system data metrics, including disaggregated data for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care, in an analyzable format."
