    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, livestock market reporting, and regulations. The marketing relationships of swine producers with meat packers have changed significantly, affecting swine prices. The concentration of the meat packing industry and increased imports of live swine have reduced slaughter capacity and impacted swine prices. A swine market price crisis occurred in the US from October to December 1998 due to increased swine availability and decreased packer slaughter capacity. In the fourth quarter of 1998, live swine prices in the US spot market hit a historic low, dropping 37% compared to 1932. Swine producers faced a $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment value that year. Despite a minimal change in retail prices, pork consumption rose by 7% in 1998, with swine producers receiving only $0.22 of the consumer pork dollar, marking the first time they received less than 30% of the total spent on pork products. The purpose of this Act is to compensate swine producers for losses incurred in 1998 due to adverse economic factors and the government's failure to pursue foreign trade opportunities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"swine,\" \"swine producer,\" \"crisis period,\" \"packer,\" \"feeder pig,\" \"swine operation,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain producers affiliated with publicly owned packers are ineligible. Assistance will be limited to eligible swine producers. The Act limits assistance to eligible swine producers through an application process. Producers must submit required information to the Secretary for eligibility determination. SEC. 5. PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND PAYMENT LIMITATIONS. Assistance under this Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. Payments to eligible producers will not exceed $25.00 per slaughter-weight swine or $9.00 per feeder pig marketed during the crisis period. Payments will be calculated based on the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered during the crisis period. Payments to swine producers will be calculated by adding $25.00 per slaughter-weight swine, $9.00 per feeder pig, and deducting payments received in another program. Payment limitations are set at $50,000 per swine operation. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, and loans obtained from various other programs such as the Agricultural Market Transition Act, noninsured crop assistance program, crop insurance indemnities, and emergency loans. Payments made to swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program are also included. Payments made to swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program announced on January 8, 1999, using funds from section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, will be deducted from payments made under this Act. SEC. 7 of the Act designates funds as an emergency requirement and authorizes the use of the Commodity Credit Corporation. SEC. 8 mandates livestock market reporting under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. In this section, definitions are provided for livestock, livestock product, packer, and prices, volume, and terms of sale. Livestock includes cattle, sheep, and swine. Livestock product refers to products derived from livestock. A packer is defined as a person engaged in buying, manufacturing, or marketing livestock products. Prices, volume, and terms of sale encompass various factors such as base price, premiums, discounts, and quality characteristics. The Secretary of Agriculture defines packers subject to mandatory reporting requirements based on their market share of livestock and livestock products. These packers must report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale to the Secretary. The Secretary requires packers to report price, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock and products. Noncompliance is unlawful, and the Secretary can verify information accuracy and impose penalties if needed. The Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation if a packer is believed to be violating regulations. Factors considered for the penalty include the seriousness of the offense, the size of the business, and the impact on the packer's ability to operate. If the penalty is not appealed or upheld, the case may be referred to the attorney general. The Secretary may refer a packer to the Attorney General for non-payment of a civil penalty. Voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting is encouraged. Information received will be made available to the public in a timely manner with limitations on disclosing party identities. The report's confidentiality is protected, and the Secretary's authority to collect voluntary reports remains unaffected by this section. The mandatory reporting requirement will expire after three years. Section 416 of the Packers and Stockyards Act is repealed. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS. The Secretary and the Commodity Credit Corporation must issue regulations promptly after the enactment of the Act to implement it. The regulations will address misrepresentations, appeals, and entitlement to benefits without following certain procedural requirements. The Secretary must use authority under section 808(2) of title 5, US Code for Congressional review of agency rulemaking."
