    "content": "The \"Business Travel Facilitation Act of 2006\" may be cited as the Business Travel Facilitation Act. This Act pertains to business facilitation visitors. Section 214 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include business facilitation visitors, defined as aliens visiting the US temporarily for business purposes such as providing services or receiving training from a US entity. Admission as a business facilitation visitor is subject to certain conditions. Aliens visiting the US for business purposes must meet specific conditions, including certification by the Secretary of Homeland Security for countries combating visa fraud and approval by a consular officer based on evidence provided by the alien. Conditions also apply to the provision of services as a business facilitation visitor. Conditions for aliens providing services in the US include having all expenses covered by their employer, possessing expert knowledge, and holding necessary licenses. The conditions for aliens providing technical training in the US include being affiliated with a US entity through ownership or joint venture, or having business relations with the US entity. Aliens providing or receiving management training in the US must have their remuneration and expenses covered by their employer. For those providing training, they need at least 5 years of management experience and detailed knowledge of their employer's business operations. Those receiving training must hold a management level position within their employer within 1 year of completing the training. The period of authorized admission for a business facilitation visitor providing professional services is 1 year, with a possible 6-month extension granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security under specific conditions. The period of authorized admission for an alien admitted as a business facilitation visitor providing or receiving management or technical training is limited to 1 year. Business facilitation visitors are not eligible for a change of nonimmigrant status or adjustment to immigrant status during their stay. The Secretary of Homeland Security may prohibit nationals from admission as business facilitation visitors if there is a pattern of fraud involving visa applications. A qualifying services contract is defined as a contract between a foreign provider of professional services and a United States entity, outlining the time period, duties, remuneration, and working conditions for the alien in the United States. The qualifying services contract must include provisions ensuring the alien's compliance with admission terms and return to their home country at the end of their stay, along with possessing necessary credentials for the services in the United States."
