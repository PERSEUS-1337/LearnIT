    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financial options for agricultural producers to preserve prime, unique, and strategic farmland in cooperation with States and local governments. Congress recognizes the need for federal assistance to protect farmlands of exceptional agricultural, economic, or environmental value from being converted to nonagricultural uses due to the lack of competitive options for landowners. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 provide financial options for agricultural producers to preserve prime farmland. The Act is amended to include federal cost-sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 offer financial support for preserving prime farmland through farmland protection easements. Qualifying farmland is defined as land crucial for agricultural, economic, or environmental reasons and at risk of non-agricultural development. Farmland protection easements restrict incompatible land uses and are binding on all future landowners in eligible states with approved easement acquisition programs. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 provide financial support for preserving prime farmland through farmland protection easements. The Secretary may carry out a matching grant program to assist eligible States in retaining qualifying farmland in agricultural use. Matching grants can be used for acquiring farmland protection easements to protect farmland from incompatible uses or for developing similar programs. Matching grants are typically on a 50-50 basis, but can be up to 90 percent for States actively protecting farmland. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 provide financial support for preserving prime farmland through farmland protection easements. An eligible State may not receive more than 10 percent of the total matching grants available for a fiscal year. The Secretary must ensure that funds are used to protect qualifying farmland, with priority given to lands important to the State's agriculture industry, and that the purchase price of farmland protection easements does not exceed fair market value on average. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
