    "content": "The \"Violent Crime Reduction Act of 2007\" designates and provides assistance for high-intensity interstate gang activity areas under Title XV of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The \"Violent Crime Reduction Act of 2007\" defines key terms such as Governor, high-intensity interstate gang activity area, and State. The Attorney General can designate specified areas as high-intensity interstate gang activity areas based on certain criteria. Federal assistance is available for these designated areas. The Attorney General is required to provide Federal assistance to high-intensity interstate gang activity areas by establishing criminal street gang enforcement teams consisting of Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities for investigation and prosecution of criminal street gangs. Personnel can be reassigned from Federal departments or agencies, with necessary funding provided for the operation of these teams. The Attorney General must provide Federal assistance to high-intensity interstate gang activity areas by forming criminal street gang enforcement teams composed of agents and officers from various Federal agencies. Funding is allocated for national and regional meetings to support the effective operation of these teams through intelligence sharing and best practices. The Attorney General designates high-intensity interstate gang activity areas based on criteria such as current and predicted gang crime levels, the relationship between violent crime and gang activity, and the commitment of resources by State and local law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General can hire up to 94 additional Assistant U.S. Attorneys to address gang crime in high-intensity interstate gang activity areas. Appropriations are authorized to support this initiative. Grants are provided to state and local prosecutors to combat violent crime and protect witnesses and victims of crimes. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to provide grants for hiring additional prosecutors, funding technology and training for accurate identification of gang members and violent offenders, and prosecuting young violent offenders. Authorization of appropriations is also amended. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to authorize appropriations of $20,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2012. Grants are provided to State and local law enforcement for establishing State-wide crime prevention databases to track criminals, arrests, prosecutions, and convictions."
