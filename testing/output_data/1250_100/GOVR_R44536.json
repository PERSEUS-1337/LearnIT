Recent congressional interest has focused on the regulations' impact on farms storing oil. Legislation from the 113th and 114th Congresses has altered the SPCC regulations' applicability for farms, with stakeholders citing financial burdens as a key concern. The EPA's SPCC regulations require facilities to prevent oil discharges, with some farmers facing high costs for inspection and certification by a Professional Engineer. EPA argues that compliance costs are lower than spill cleanup costs. A 2015 study found no need for farm-specific exemptions due to similar storage conditions. Congressional legislation has addressed SPCC regulations, with concerns about financial burdens for farms. The Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated regulations to prevent oil spills and hazardous substance discharges from vessels and facilities. The EPA was established in 1970 to oversee environmental protection, with the Coast Guard having jurisdiction over vessels. Interagency agreements have altered implementation authority, with various agencies overseeing facilities. As of a 1994 interagency agreement, EPA has jurisdiction over non-transportation-related onshore and offshore facilities, while the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over transportation-related onshore facilities. The Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over offshore facilities. States can also impose their own requirements for oil spill prevention. EPA's SPCC regulations in 40 C.F.R. Part 112 require certain facilities to prepare and implement SPCC plans. SPCC regulations require facilities to prepare and implement SPCC plans, with certain higher-risk facilities needing to submit Facility Response Plans to EPA. Secondary containment is required for oil-storage units, and plans must be certified by a licensed professional engineer unless self-certification conditions are met. Most facilities with no discharge history storing 10,000 gallons or less can self-certify, with a 20,000-gallon threshold for farms. EPA issued SPCC regulations in 1973, with amendments made in 2002. Compliance deadlines were extended, and further amendments were made over the following years. The 2002 SPCC rule compliance deadline was extended for farms to May 10, 2013. Congress enacted P.L. 113-6, prohibiting EPA from enforcing SPCC provisions at farms until September 22, 2013. Owners must maintain and implement SPCC plans as per regulations since 1974. The EPA SPCC plan requirements apply to facilities that could discharge oil into navigable waters. The definition of \"navigable waters\" has been a controversial topic. Army Corps of Engineers and EPA finalized revised regulations on May 27, 2015. In 2015, the Army Corps of Engineers and EPA finalized regulations defining protected waters under the CWA. The definition of oil includes petroleum-based and non-petroleum-based oils. EPA's SPCC regulatory definition covers oils from animal, vegetable, and other sources. Facilities subject to the SPCC rule must meet specific capacity thresholds for oil storage. EPA estimated that around 640,000 facilities are subject to SPCC requirements, with oil and gas production facilities making up 29% and farms 27%. Approximately 152,000 farms are subject to SPCC regulations, representing 8% of all farms nationwide. Recent SPCC issues have focused on program scope and applicability, especially concerning farms. The regulations define a farm as a facility devoted to crop production or animal raising that generates $1,000 or more in agricultural products annually. On June 10, 2014, the President signed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 (P.L. 113-121), which modified the applicability of SPCC regulations to farms. Changes included raising the threshold for farms not subject to SPCC regulations to less than 2,500 gallons for aboveground storage capacity. Farms with less than 6,000 gallons and no discharge history are also exempt. Additionally, farms with less than 20,000 gallons, no individual tank over 10,000 gallons, and no discharge history can self-certify their SPCC plan. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 modified SPCC regulations for farms, raising the threshold to less than 2,500 gallons for aboveground storage capacity. EPA concluded that the appropriate threshold should be 2,500 gallons instead of 6,000 gallons. A proposed rule for this change was scheduled for August 2016, but as of now, EPA has not published it. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN, P.L. 114-322) includes provisions that modify the applicability of SPCC regulations for farms, specifically exempting smaller containers from counting towards aggregate storage capacity or being covered by SPCC regulations. The term \"separate parcels\" is a key term in the legislation, but EPA's interpretation of this phrase is uncertain. The term \"parcel\" is included in the definition of facility in SPCC regulations, but it is not defined. EPA modified the definition of facility in 2008 to include various structures and equipment. The boundaries of a facility depend on ownership and types of activities. Table 1 compares SPCC aggregate capacity thresholds before and after WIIN in 2016. EPA regulations were also modified. Enforcement of the SPCC program is primarily handled by EPA regional offices, as states do not have the authority to enforce SPCC regulations. A 2012 EPA report highlighted issues with compliance at regulated facilities, with approximately 55% found to be non-compliant. There is no recent data available on enforcement activities."
