    "content": "Title V of the Social Security Act authorizes funding for services to improve the health of mothers and children, including the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant. Administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, this grant is the largest under Title V. Established in 1935, Title V aims to support maternal and child health services, especially in low-income and rural areas. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272) replaced the term \"crippled\" with \"children with special health care needs.\" Programs targeting children with special health care needs and low-income women and children were added to the Public Health Service Act and the Social Security Act, including services for children with disabilities, lead-based paint poisoning prevention, genetic disease programs, sudden infant death syndrome programs, hemophilia treatment centers, and adolescent pregnancy grants. Title V was converted to the MCH Services Block Grant in 1981 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) 1981.  today H,e the of your your your your your your youryour Any of youryour es . always who for those who.........\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. The MCH Services Block Grant provides funding to states and territories for maternal and child health services. Funds are allocated for CISS grants and research through SPRANS grants. The grant aims to achieve seven goals, including ensuring access to quality healthcare for mothers and children, reducing infant mortality, and providing comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care. The MCH Services Block Grant funds services for blind and disabled children, rehabilitative services, and family-centered care for children with special health needs. It also provides toll-free hotlines for pregnant women and children eligible for Medicaid. The funds are used to fill gaps in public health services for low-income mothers and children, including workforce development, genetic services, and hemophilia treatment. States must use at least 30% of the block grant to ensure access to quality maternal and child health services. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds services for children with special health care needs, including preventive and primary care, dental care, immunization, and family planning. States determine the specific services provided under the block grant, which may include inpatient services for children with special health care needs, lead-based poisoning screening, and counseling for parents of sudden infant death syndrome victims. The funding also supports school-based health centers and serves women and children with public and private insurance, as well as those without insurance coverage. Low-income mothers and children are defined as those with family income below 100% for the purpose of allocating block grant funds. Block grants to states provide funding for core public health services for low-income mothers and children. The services are presented in a four-level pyramid, including infrastructure building, population-based, enabling, and direct health care. Infrastructure building services focus on developing and maintaining health systems, increasing capacity through training and workforce development, coordinating health care systems, and funding research. Population-based services promote public health initiatives. In FY2015, the largest category of expenditures nationwide under the block grant was direct health care services for low-income mothers and children and children with special health care needs (63.3%), followed by enabling services (18.7%), population-based services (10.5%), and infrastructure (7.6%). The distribution of funds between service categories varies widely by state and depends on the needs of each state's population. Direct health care services may cost more per person served than other services. Block grant funds have specific prohibitions on their use, such as not being able to be used for inpatient services, cash payments, or major medical equipment. States must adhere to these guidelines when utilizing the funds. States receiving block grant funds must adhere to specific prohibitions on how the funds can be used, such as not for inpatient services, cash payments, or major medical equipment. To receive the funds, states must submit an application with a statewide needs assessment every five years, outlining health status goals, preventive care needs, and services for special populations. The plan must detail how the funds will be used to address these needs. Title V requires state agencies administering the program to coordinate block grant services with Medicaid, including EPSDT. This coordination aims to make Medicaid services accessible, enroll eligible individuals, and avoid duplication of efforts. State block grant administrators must also coordinate with other programs like WIC, education programs, and health services. Interagency agreements outline the expected coordination levels, with variations in scope and formality. Most agreements specify services provided by each agency, with Title V agencies often contracting with health providers for service delivery. The Title V agency contracts with health providers for services, and the state's Medicaid program reimburses when possible. States may coordinate with other services like WIC. HRSA's 2008 analysis recommended specific components for interagency agreements. The SPRANS program is a HRSA-administered grant program for maternal and child health research and training. Eligible institutions must support national needs and priorities, have regional significance, and improve state systems of care for mothers and children. The SPRANS program allocates funds for various maternal and child health initiatives, including oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Funds can also be used for genetic disease testing, counseling, and newborn screening. Priority is given to projects in areas with high infant mortality rates, with funding decisions typically made by HRSA. Congressional directives sometimes dictate specific program funding, comprising about 16% of SPRANS funding in FY2016. Additionally, the Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program supports family-staffed initiatives. The Family-to-Family Health Information Centers (F2F HICs) program funds family-run centers in all states and the District of Columbia, providing information, education, and peer support to families of children with special health care needs. The CISS program, a HRSA-administered grant, aims to increase service delivery capacity and promote community-based health systems for mothers and children, especially in rural areas and for children with special health care needs. Public or private organizations can receive CISS grants to develop integrated services at the community level. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds various programs such as maternal and child health centers, projects for rural populations, and services for children with special health care needs. Funds are distributed to states based on the number of low-income children, with a portion reserved for competitive grants under SPRANS and CISS. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant distributes funds to states based on the number of low-income children. States must match federal funds and maintain funding levels for maternal and child health programs. Funds are awarded quarterly and can be used for the current and subsequent fiscal year. Unused funds are redistributed among other states. Appendix B shows federal allocations and state matches for FY2015. The MCH Services Block Grant allocates funds to states based on low-income children. 15% of the grant is awarded competitively for SPRANS, with additional funding for specific programs like Family to Family Information Centers. CISS program is initiated when grant exceeds $600 million, with 12.75% set aside for activities focusing on high infant mortality rate areas. In FY2016, $638.2 million was appropriated, with $550.8 million for block grants, $77.1 million for SPRANS, and $10.3 million for CISS. The President's budget requested $638.2 million for the MCH Services Block Grant for FY2017. Funding for the program is discretionary and subject to annual appropriations. Historical funding for the block grant peaked at $731.3 million in FY2002, with a $93.1 million decrease since then. Federal funding may be offset by new Title V programs authorized in the ACA. States are required to provide matching funds for federal block grants. The MCH Services Block Grant is funded by federal funding, with states required to provide a $3 match for every $4 of federal funding. Other funds from local, state, or federal sources can also support MCH activities. Reporting mechanisms include a needs assessment, annual reports, and biennial audits. HRSA reports to Congress on program activities, and national performance measures were established in 1997. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) introduced the Title V Information System (TVIS) in 1998 to collect state-level data on Title V performance measures. States have been reporting annually on their progress towards achieving National Performance Measures (NPMs) since 2011. A new performance measurement system includes NPMs, national outcome measures (NOMs), and evidence-based/informed strategy measures (ESMs). States select 8 out of 15 NPMs for programmatic focus during a five-year reporting cycle starting from FY2016. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) introduced the Title V Information System (TVIS) in 1998 to collect state-level data on Title V performance measures. States select 8 out of 15 NPMs for programmatic focus during a five-year reporting cycle starting from FY2016. The new performance measurement system aims to increase flexibility, reduce reporting burden, and enhance accountability for states. States must submit annual reports on Title V activities in a standardized format, detailing progress towards national and state health objectives. The reports must include information on program participation, standardized measures of maternal and child health, data on maternal and child health systems, and workforce measures. States select 7 to 10 priority needs in their five-year strategic plans, with common priorities including family support services, oral health services, childhood obesity, mental health systems, and services for children with disabilities. States are required to provide the number of individuals served by the Title V block grant, with estimates allowed if actual numbers are not available. States are required to report expenditures by four broad categories of service and provide maternal and child health measures, including data on maternal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, and vaccination rates. HRSA differentiates between health \"performance\" measures and health \"outcome\" measures, compiled from various sources. States must report data on these indicators by county, race, and ethnicity annually. States are required to report pediatric and family practice workforce data to HRSA annually, including information on healthcare providers licensed in the state. They must also report on the access to services for Medicaid-eligible individuals and pregnant women's access to prenatal care. HRSA compiles this information and presents it to Congress, including maternal and child health indicators nationally and by state. In FY2014, 59 states and jurisdictions received MCH Services Block Grant Funding, serving 2.0 million pregnant women and 36.9 million children, including 2.7 million children with special health care needs. States reported that 3.7 million infants and 7.7 million others received services funded by the block grant. Figure 4 illustrates the proportion of individuals served nationally by the MCH Services Block Grant, with nearly 50.4 million persons served by Title V programs. The largest category served are children aged 1 to 22, followed by women. The largest category of individuals served nationally by Title V programs are children aged 1 to 22, followed by women of childbearing age, infants, children with special health care needs, and pregnant women. In FY2012, 33% of pregnant women receiving Title V-funded services had private health insurance, 56% were on Medicaid, and 4% had no insurance. For children ages 1 to 22 receiving services, 34% were on Medicaid, 4% on CHIP, 29% had private insurance, and 6% had no insurance. Insurance coverage status varied by state based on needs. The federal block grant funds for maternal and child health vary by state, with at least 30% allocated for children with special health care needs. State matching funds and other sources are not required to follow federal allocation requirements, providing flexibility. Selected national and state indicators of maternal and child health are reported to HRSA, with data from CDC for comparison. Indicators are chosen based on relevance to the goals of the MCH Services Block Grant. The report discusses indicators of maternal and child health relevant to the MCH Services Block Grant goals. These measures, referred to as outcome measures and performance indicators by HRSA, are important for Title V funding. Other federal and state programs, like Medicaid and WIC, also impact the health of low-income children and families. Access to quality healthcare for mothers and children is measured through insurance coverage and preventive care visits. According to the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, almost 95% of all children have health insurance coverage, but the proportion varies by race, ethnicity, and poverty status. For example, 81% of children in households at or below the federal poverty level have health insurance, compared to 99% in households at 400% or more of the federal poverty level. The survey also found disparities in health insurance coverage among Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black children. Infant mortality rate is used as an indicator for children's health status. The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics has published the most recent data on infant mortality rates (IMR) by state and region, showing higher rates in the South and Midwest. Mississippi had the highest IMR in 2008, while New Hampshire had the lowest. Factors such as teenage births, prematurity, and inadequate prenatal care contribute to higher IMR, especially among low-income families. Disparities in infant mortality rates between Medicaid-enrolled women and non-Medicaid women vary widely by state. For example, South Dakota reported a higher IMR for Medicaid-enrolled women in 2012. In 2012, the infant mortality rate for women enrolled in Medicaid was 10.3 per 1,000 live births, compared to 7.7 per 1,000 for those not in the program. Prenatal care is crucial for maternal and child health, with late or no care leading to childbirth complications. Rates of prenatal care in the first trimester vary by state, with disparities between Medicaid and non-Medicaid populations. Barriers to early prenatal care include lack of insurance and access to primary care providers. Barriers to early prenatal care among racial and ethnic minorities include limited availability of maternity care providers, transportation, and late enrollment in Medicaid. Researchers have identified persisting barriers to regular preventive health care visits for children, with federal programs like EPSDT aiming to ensure all children receive quality care. In the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, 84% of children had one preventive health care visit in the preceding year, with slight variation among racial and ethnic groups. Uninsured children were less likely to have received preventive health care compared to those covered by public insurance. Children with special health care needs, especially those covered by public insurance, may face barriers in accessing preventive and health care services. Privately insured children are more likely to receive preventive care. Older children and teenagers are less likely to receive preventive care compared to infants and preschool-aged children. Access to additional services for children with special health care needs may create financial burdens on families. In the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, 76% of children did not have unmet health care needs, but uninsured children had a higher rate of unmet needs. The 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs found that unmet health care needs were higher among uninsured children (56%) compared to insured children (23%). Family-centered care, including shared decision-making and medical homes, is crucial for children with special health care needs. Insurance coverage is linked to higher rates of family-centered coordinated care. The 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health found that 47% of children with special health care needs had a medical home, which provides access to primary care providers and a coordinated care team. Access to medical homes varies across states, with state toll-free hotlines assisting in Medicaid enrollment. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant aims to increase access to health care and coverage for preventive services. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant aims to provide flexibility to states in achieving health goals for children, with over 34 million children served in FY2013. Changes under the ACA may impact the number of pregnant women and children served by the grant. Policymakers argue that the grant is crucial during this transition period to ensure continuity of care and reduce coverage gaps. Discretionary grants are important for ensuring continuity of care and reducing coverage gaps due to shifts in insurance eligibility. States may argue that block grant funds can be redirected to meet other maternal and child health goals. Concerns about federal funds addressing state-specific issues rather than national concerns exist. States are best suited to use block grant funds in situations with wide variability in burden and cost, such as filling gaps left by Medicaid and CHIP. Outcome measures and performance indicators are important for Title V funding objectives. Title V funding is just one factor influencing health measures for low-income children and families. Progress towards national health goals like reducing infant mortality has stalled. It's challenging to track the direct impact of block grant funds on indicators like IMR due to funding flexibility and societal issues. Congress and the executive branch can't mandate states to focus on specific data points with block grant funding. Alternative programs like home visiting and targeted public health initiatives are seen as more direct ways to improve maternal and child health. Healthy Start, a national program targeting infant mortality in selected communities, has been successful. Some argue that the decentralized nature of block grants makes it difficult to measure program performance and accountability. The quality of services provided under block grant funding is not currently tracked. Existing data required by Title V may be used to determine efficient funding of gap areas with block grant funds. Additionally, Title V contains provisions added or amended by the ACA, with most provisions having mandatory appropriations for FY2010 through FY2014. The SSA authorizes programs like the Abstinence Education and Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs. Funding for these programs has been allocated through various acts, with increases in funding over the years. The Abstinence Education program focuses on promoting abstinence outside of marriage, while the Home Visiting Programs support at-risk families with in-home visits by professionals. The Home Visitation Grant Program received funding of $100 million for FY2010, increasing to $400 million for FY2013 and remaining at that level through FY2017. Funding was extended through FY2015 and $400 million was allocated for FY2016 and FY2017. 3% of the funding is reserved for research and evaluation, and 3% for grants to tribal entities. The program is administered by the Administration for Children and Families and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The Personal Responsibility Education program, administered by the Administration for Children and Families, aims to educate adolescents on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. These subjects include healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. The ACA allocated $75 million annually for this program. The ACA allocated $75 million annually for the Personal Responsibility Education program (PREP) for FY2010 through FY2017. Funding for Title V Block Grants, MCH Services Block Grants, and discretionary grants by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau are also detailed in various tables. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) funds over 700 projects annually through discretionary grants, with data captured electronically in the DGIS system. Performance measures are being revised to better align with program goals and Title V Block Grant requirements. The revised measures aim to accurately reflect the services provided and have reduced the overall number of performance measures. The number of performance measures for grantees has been reduced in the revised data collection process by MCHB. This change aims to better capture the different program models and services provided, resulting in a more accurate representation of grant program services."
