    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes, challenges, crowdsourcing, and citizen science for Federal agencies, including cost-effectiveness and increased innovation. Granting explicit authority for these techniques will remove ambiguity and encourage their appropriate use to advance agency missions. Crowdsourcing and citizen science projects offer unique benefits such as improving government services with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to federal agency missions, acquiring data at a greater extent, and enabling citizens to address community concerns through data gathering and sharing. Citizen science offers benefits like advancing scientific research, improving science literacy, furthering science diplomacy, and building trust between citizens and scientists. Federal agencies should provide incentives for participants based on their motivations, such as receiving attribution for their contributions. Citizen science participants benefit from receiving attribution for their contributions, learning new skills, connecting with others, and knowing their work helps solve meaningful problems in science for society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, definitions are provided for key terms such as \"citizen science\" and \"crowdsourcing.\" Citizen science involves individuals or organizations participating in various aspects of the scientific process, while crowdsourcing is a method of obtaining services or content through voluntary contributions. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" is defined as a government agency. In this section, key terms such as \"Federal agency,\" \"participant,\" and \"related entity\" are defined. A Federal agency includes Executive agencies and military departments but excludes legislative branch agencies. A participant is an individual or entity volunteering in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. A related entity includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, and others associated with a Federal agency. The head of each Federal agency or multiple agencies working together can use crowdsourcing and citizen science for their missions. Voluntary services can be accepted under certain conditions, and participation in projects must be advertised. Federal agencies can determine consent, registration, and terms of use for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. They must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms clearly to participants. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must comply with regulations regarding human subjects and data collection. Data collected should be made publicly available in machine-readable formats, with participants being informed about data usage, ownership, and availability to the public or third parties. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must make technologies, applications, code, and derivations of intellectual property developed through the project open to the public. Participants must agree to assume all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct. Federal agencies coordinating citizen science projects must ensure participants adhere to relevant scientific integrity policies. The head of each agency can partner with private or public entities for administrative duties. Funding for these activities can come from Congress or external sources. The Administrator of the General Services Administration, in coordination with the Director, will develop products and services to support crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. Funding can be accepted from various entities, but no special consideration should be given in return. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 2 years, as part of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act report. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 2 years, as part of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act report. The report will include details such as proposed goals, participation rates, resources used, and ways in which the projects were executed. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 2 years will include details on how each project advanced the agency's mission, project results, data quality methods, and any savings or costs incurred. It will also summarize the main challenges and barriers faced by Federal agencies in conducting these projects. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects by Federal agencies will include details on project advancements, results, data quality methods, challenges faced, recommendations for future actions, use of crowdsourcing methods, and any other relevant information. Additionally, the section clarifies that this report does not affect the authority or resources allocated for crowdsourcing and citizen science projects authorized by other laws."
