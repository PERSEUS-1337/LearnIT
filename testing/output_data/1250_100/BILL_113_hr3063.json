    "content": "The \"Healthy Fisheries through Better Science Act\" defines stock assessment as evaluating the past, present, and future status of a fish stock, including life history characteristics and fishing. It also requires a stock assessment plan. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a Stock Assessment Plan, which requires the Secretary to develop and publish a schedule for updating stock assessments for all fish stocks under a fishery management plan. The Stock Assessment Plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act mandates regular stock assessments for fish stocks, with specific timelines for assessments of previously unassessed stocks and the inclusion of data on recreational fishing. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires regular stock assessments for fish stocks, with a provision for a waiver if deemed unnecessary by the Secretary of Commerce. The first stock assessment plan must be issued within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. IMPROVING SCIENCE. Improving science in fisheries management involves incorporating information from various sources and improving data collection and analysis through consultation with scientific committees. The guidelines under section 302(g) aim to incorporate data and analysis from nongovernmental sources like fishermen, universities, and research institutions into fisheries management decisions. They will identify types of data for recreational fishing, provide guidance for data collection and analysis to reduce uncertainty in stock assessments. The Secretary and Regional Fishery Management Councils must use data and analyses meeting guidelines for fisheries management decisions. If not used, reasons must be provided in the Federal Register notice. The Secretary of Commerce must develop guidelines for fisheries management decisions within 1 year of the enactment of this Act, with explanations required in the Federal Register if data or analysis is not used. Within 1 year of enactment, the Secretary of Commerce must submit a report to Congress on cost reduction for fisheries management plans, including goals, methods, cost-effectiveness, and explanations for not using the most cost-effective methods. SEC. 6. COST SHARING. Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require the Secretary to prepare an analysis of costs recovered by fees before collecting any fees."
