    "content": "In the short run, the relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate may be loose. Unemployment may not immediately decrease when economic growth picks up after a recession due to firms having underutilized employees on their payrolls. Employers can initially increase output without hiring more workers by raising productivity. Output growth during an economic expansion depends on the growth rates of labor supply and labor productivity. In the long run, there is a negative relationship between real GDP growth rates and unemployment, known as \"Okun's law.\" This law states that stable unemployment requires real GDP growth to match potential output growth. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. The rate of GDP growth is influenced by potential productivity and labor supply at full employment. When the unemployment rate is high, actual GDP falls short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. If GDP growth lags behind labor force growth, unemployment rises. Conversely, if GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment falls. If GDP growth equals labor force growth with productivity growth, there may be an excess of labor force. The unemployment rate will rise if GDP growth lags behind labor force growth. To lower the unemployment rate, GDP growth must exceed the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity. Labor force growth has slowed over time, and is projected to continue decreasing. Predicting productivity growth is more challenging than predicting labor force growth. Between 1947 and 1973, productivity in the private nonfarm business sector grew at an annual rate of 2.8%. From 1973 to 1995, productivity slowed to 1.4% annually, then accelerated to 2.9% between 1995 and 2005. Since 2005, productivity growth has slowed to 1.6% annually. To lower the unemployment rate, real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed. According to Okun's law, a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment requires GDP to grow 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. Labor force growth has slowed, making it challenging to predict productivity growth. The unemployment rate trends after economic contractions vary in timing and pace. Jobless recoveries have been observed in the past, with some periods taking over a year for the rate to decline steadily. The current recovery is closer to the high-end range in terms of timing. The pace of decline in the unemployment rate also varies, with some postwar recessions taking at least eight months for a one percentage point decrease. The slowest decline was seen after the recession ending in November 2001. The recession that ended in November 2001 had the lowest unemployment rate at 5.5%. It took about 3\u00bd years for the rate to drop by half a percentage point. In contrast, the expansion after the July 1981-November 1982 downturn started with a high unemployment rate of 10.8%, which fell to 9.4% in eight months. There was a debate on Okun's law and economic growth's impact on unemployment rate. Slow GDP growth in 2011 led to a stall in the unemployment rate at 9.0%, but it dropped to 8.5% in December 2011 after output growth accelerated. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board noted a disconnect between the decline in the unemployment rate and GDP growth in 2011. Despite low GDP growth, the unemployment rate dropped to 8.5% in December 2011. Bernanke suggested this may have compensated for a previous deviation from Okun's law. Studies have shown variations in the relationship between economic growth and unemployment, with some attributing it to the stage of the business cycle. Some variation in the relationship between economic growth and unemployment may be due to the stage of the business cycle. Owyang and Sekhposyan caution against relying too heavily on back-of-the-envelope calculations linking changes in the unemployment rate to output growth. Ball et al, however, support Okun's theory that output changes affect unemployment similarly in both recessions and recoveries. They found that Okun's law held true during recent jobless recoveries, with large output gaps persisting. According to economists, Okun's Law has proven to be strong and stable in macroeconomics, with deviations often exaggerated. Economist Robert J. Gordon predicts slower growth in potential GDP due to diminishing gains from information technology investments, projecting a 2.4% growth rate in potential output over the next 20 years. This slower growth, along with declines in labor force growth, could lead to a declining unemployment rate. Economists Susanto Basu and John G. Fernald also highlight the significant decline in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession. The economists Basu and Fernald discuss the impact of the 2007-2009 recession on household net worth, which could affect workers' ability to afford leisure time. They suggest that labor supply may increase in the short term, temporarily boosting potential output growth. However, disruptions in financial markets may constrain growth in the near term. Weidner and Williams analyze past recoveries and estimate that potential output growth was faster in the 1960s-1980s compared to the 1990s-2000s. They predict a slower potential GDP growth of 2.1% at the start of the recovery from the Great Recession due to slow labor force growth. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that potential output growth will be 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, lower than the 3.3% growth rate between 1950 and 2011. This decrease is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, with the annual average rate of unemployment expected to remain above 8.0% through 2014 before falling to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
