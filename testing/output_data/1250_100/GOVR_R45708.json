    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with a proposed budget of $38.02 billion for FY2020, which is 15% lower than the FY2019 appropriation. The bill also includes a 12% increase for DOE nuclear weapons activities. In FY2019, the total appropriations were $44.66 billion, 3% above the FY2018 level. The President signed the bill on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244). FY2019 figures exclude emergency supplemental appropriations provided for natural disaster response. The FY2020 budget proposes reductions in DOE energy research and development programs, including cuts in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. Funding would also be reduced for USACE, Reclamation, and CUP. The FY2020 budget proposes significant reductions in funding for USACE, Reclamation, and CUP, totaling $2.172 billion (-31%) and $462 million (-29%) respectively. Congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by budget enforcement measures from the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established limits on discretionary spending enforced through sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019, but limits for FY2020 remain lower. A bill to raise defense and nondefense spending limits for FY2020 and FY2021 was reported by the House Budget Committee. Issues raised by the Administration's budget request could generate controversy during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The Trump Administration requested reduced funding for USACE and Reclamation in FY2020, with cuts of 31% and 29% respectively. The request includes no funding for new projects and seeks to limit funding for ongoing projects based on cost-benefit ratios. Additionally, the Administration proposes transferring a program from USACE to DOE. For more details, refer to CRS reports on Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation FY2020 appropriations. The FY2020 budget request includes proposals to divest assets of three PMAs - BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, which own transmission infrastructure, with projected savings of $5.8 billion over 10 years. It also proposes repealing WAPA's borrowing authority for its Transmission Infrastructure Program and eliminating the statutory requirement for PMAs to limit rates to recovery costs. The FY2020 budget proposes transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate setting approach, yielding $1.9 billion in new revenues over 10 years. It also calls for repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for WAPA, saving $640 million over 10 years. These proposals require authorizing legislation and have faced opposition from various groups and Members of Congress. Some policy research institutes support PMA reforms. The FY2020 budget request proposes to terminate the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program (SEP), which provide grants for energy efficiency improvements. The proposed elimination is due to a shift in focus towards early-stage R&D, leading to significant reductions in DOE R&D funding for energy programs. The FY2020 DOE budget proposes significant reductions in funding for various energy technologies, including bioenergy, vehicle, natural gas, advanced manufacturing, building, wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear fuel cycle R&D. The focus is on early-stage R&D, with a shift towards private sector funding for later-stage research and development. Additionally, the budget includes new funding for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, with $116 million allocated for seeking an NRC license and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity. The DOE's FY2020 budget proposes funding reductions for various energy technologies, with a focus on early-stage R&D and private sector funding for later-stage research. $116 million is allocated for seeking an NRC license and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity at Yucca Mountain. The House voted for funding in FY2018 and an increase for FY2019, but the Senate did not include it. The FY2019 appropriations measure did not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the Senate's nuclear waste pilot program. The FY2020 budget request does not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the Senate's nuclear waste pilot program. It would halt further loans and loan guarantees under DOE's various programs, including the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. Additionally, the budget proposal would stop further loan guarantees under DOE's Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Unused prior-year authority for loan guarantee commitments would be rescinded, along with unspent appropriations for loan guarantee \"subsidy costs.\" The FY2020 DOE appropriation request includes $107 million for the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. The project aims to develop fusion-based electricity and the U.S. will pay 9% of the construction costs. Other collaborators include the European Union, Russia, Japan, India, South Korea, and China. The total U.S. share of the cost is estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. The FY2020 budget request for DOE includes funding for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, with the U.S. contributing between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. The Trump Administration's budget proposes to eliminate ARPA-E and redirect its funding into DOE's applied energy research programs. ARPA-E funds research on transformative energy technologies, and the program is set to be phased out by FY 2022. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level. Funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs would increase by 10%, with notable increases for the W80-4 LEP and initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The increase in the request for the W80-4 warhead is due to a new budget estimate, not the acceleration of missile development. The FY2020 request also seeks funding for the W87-1 warhead to be carried by the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. The FY2020 budget request includes $10 million for the W76-2 LEP, a low-yield modification of the W76 warhead. NNSA is seeking $51.5 million for surveillance of the B83 gravity bomb, with a 47% increase from FY2019. Funding for Plutonium Sustainment would increase by 97% to $712 million for FY2020 to produce plutonium pits for nuclear warheads. The Administration is seeking $410 million for conceptual design and pre-Critical Decision activities at Savannah River Site in South Carolina for nuclear warheads. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management is responsible for environmental cleanup and waste management at nuclear facilities, with a total FY2020 appropriations request of $6.469 billion, a decrease of $706 million from FY2019. The budget components include Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The FY2020 request also includes a proposal to transfer management of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program to the Office of Legacy Management. The FY2020 LM budget request includes $141 million for FUSRAP, a decrease from the $150 million appropriated in FY2019. USACE will continue cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis. No markups had been held for FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations. The bill includes four titles: Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and Independent Agencies.
