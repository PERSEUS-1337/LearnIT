    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act\" and allows for the offset of state judicial debts against income tax refunds. The \"Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the collection of past-due state judicial debts by reducing overpayments payable to individuals and paying the debt to the state judicial branch or agency. The Act allows for the collection of past-due state judicial debts by reducing overpayments and paying the debt to the state agency. Overpayments are reduced after liabilities for internal revenue tax, past-due support, and other debts are satisfied. The Act allows for the reduction of overpayments to pay past-due debts owed to Federal agencies, State income tax obligations, and covered unemployment compensation debts before crediting overpayments to future Federal internal revenue tax liabilities. If the Secretary receives notice of multiple debts owed to State agencies or judicial branches, overpayments will be applied to these debts in the order they accrued. The Act allows for the reduction of overpayments to pay past-due debts owed to State judicial branches. A past-due, legally enforceable State judicial debt is defined as a debt resulting from a court judgment in criminal or traffic cases that remains unpaid. The term 'State judicial debt' includes court costs, fees, fines, assessments, and restitution to crime victims. The Secretary will issue regulations for submitting notices of past-due debts and specify the types of debts eligible for reduction. Fees may be required to cover the cost of the reduction procedure. The Secretary can use funds to reimburse costs incurred in applying a procedure. States must promptly repay any erroneous payments identified by the Secretary. Amendments are made to the disclosure of return information under the Internal Revenue Code. Amendments are made to sections of the Internal Revenue Code, including reducing overpayments for past-due State debts and future federal tax liabilities. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include reducing overpayments for State judicial debts and future federal tax liabilities. Effective date for refunds is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2008."
