For fiscal year 2018, $18.67 billion is allocated to the Disaster Relief Fund for major disasters. $10 million is designated for audits and investigations by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General. The Federal Emergency Management Agency must disclose grant awards exceeding $1 million within 5 days. Additionally, details of mission assignments exceeding $1 million must be published within the same timeframe. The Administrator must provide updates on total cost estimates and amounts obligated for disaster declarations, including Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria. This information must be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations and published on the Agency's website monthly. The categories of spending to be reported on include public assistance, individual assistance, operations, mitigation, administrative, and other relevant categories. The Administrator must publish the Disaster Relief Monthly Report on the Agency's website within 10 days of each month. Up to $4.9 billion can be transferred to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program Account for direct loans to assist local governments affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, or Maria. Territories and possessions of the United States are considered local governments for this purpose. The paragraph discusses the conditions under which territories, possessions, and local governments can receive loans exceeding $5,000,000 based on projected revenue loss and cash outlays. The loans can have specific repayment terms and can be canceled at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines terms, conditions, and disbursement of loans to territories, possessions, and local governments. FEMA can transfer funds for administrative expenses and lending costs, with a portion for cost-sharing provisions of disaster assistance. The Congress designates the amount provided for an emergency requirement under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Up to $1,000,000 may be transferred for administrative expenses to carry out the Advance of Non-Federal Share program under the major disaster declaration for Hurricanes Irma or Maria. For \"Wildland Fire Management\", an additional $184,500,000 is allocated for urgent fire suppression operations, to be transferred to repay previous funds used in fiscal year 2017. This amount is designated as an emergency requirement. Additionally, a flame wildfire suppression reserve fund is established. Up to $1,000,000 can be transferred for administrative expenses related to Hurricanes Irma or Maria. An additional $342,000,000 is allocated for the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund for large wildland fire suppression operations of the Department of Agriculture. The funds are to be used for repayment of amounts transferred for wildland fire suppression in fiscal year 2017. The amount is designated as an emergency requirement. An additional $50,000,000 is allocated for urgent wildland fire suppression activities, with funds available for repayment of transfers needed for these costs. The amount is designated as an emergency requirement under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Sec. 301 states that funds appropriated in this Act are in addition to other appropriations for the fiscal year. Sec. 302 specifies that appropriations in this Act cannot be used beyond the current fiscal year unless stated otherwise. Sec. 303 outlines that terms and conditions for funds in this Act also apply to funds in another law. Sec. 304 mentions that amounts designated for emergency requirements can only be used if the President approves. Sec. 305 requires Federal agencies to submit reports to various entities by December 31, 2017. The Government Accountability Office will review internal control plans for funds provided by this Act. All programs receiving funds are considered susceptible to improper payments. Grants must be expended within 24 months unless a waiver is granted by the Director of OMB. The House of Representatives and Senate appropriations require grant recipients to return unspent funds within 24 months. Amendments are made to the Department of Housing and Urban Development grants for Indian tribes. Repurposed funds designated as emergency requirements are specified. Changes are made to the Department of the Interior, Environment, and related programs. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 is amended to cancel $16 billion of indebtedness under the National Flood Insurance Act. This relieves the Administrator and the National Flood Insurance Fund of liability. The National Flood Insurance Fund is relieved of $16 billion in debt under the National Flood Insurance Act. The canceled indebtedness is considered a reduction in total obligations, designated as an emergency requirement by Congress. Additionally, $1,270,000,000 of funds are allocated for the contingency reserve. In response to Presidentially declared disasters, funds are available for Puerto Rico for disaster nutrition assistance until September 30, 2019. Additionally, during fiscal year 2018, there is no dollar limitation on advance billing for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Act may be cited as the \"Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017\" and defines \"billing\" as per section 2208(l)(4) of title 10, United States Code."
