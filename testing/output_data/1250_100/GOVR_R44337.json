    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific-facing nations, pending congressional approval. It aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, potentially benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income, benefiting farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. The TPP aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. This trade agreement has elicited high interest from U.S. agriculture and food industry interests due to the potential for increased market access and higher farm productivity. TPP countries already play a significant role in U.S. farm and food trade, with agricultural exports averaging $63.5 billion and imports totaling $60.9 billion between 2011 and 2015. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, potentially enhancing competitiveness. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors, including agriculture. Key conclusions of the projected effects of implementing TPP for U.S. food and agriculture were summarized based on analysis by ITC and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The TPP agreement aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, potentially enhancing competitiveness. Key provisions in the agreement focus on market access for agricultural products in countries like Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, which have higher tariffs than the United States. This could benefit U.S. farm and food exports by lowering tariffs or expanding tariff rate quotas. The agreement lacks free trade agreements with five TPP countries, including Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. The TPP agreement aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products by lowering tariffs in countries like Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Japan and Vietnam are seen as key markets with high potential for growth, while existing trade advantages in Canada and Mexico under NAFTA may diminish as more competitors gain access through TPP. The TPP agreement aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products by lowering tariffs in countries like Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Potential competitors may gain an edge over U.S. exports if the U.S. does not implement the agreement, especially in key markets like Japan and Vietnam. Safeguard measures allow for additional tariffs to be imposed if imports exceed specified thresholds, with opportunities for export expansion phased in over time. Export competitors could gain a competitive edge over U.S. exports to Japan and other markets through existing preferential tariff arrangements or agreements similar to TPP without U.S. participation. For example, Australia benefits from preferential tariff rates on beef exports to Japan compared to the U.S. TPP would level the playing field for U.S. beef. The European Union is negotiating FTAs with Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, potentially enhancing its competitive position. The impact of Brexit on these negotiations is uncertain. The TPP does not address domestic subsidy regimes that distort trade. The TPP would provide significant benefits for U.S. agriculture by eliminating tariffs and expanding markets. A report by the ITC projected that in year 15 (2032), U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion (2.6%), while agricultural imports would rise by $2.7 billion (1.5%). Other effects include a $10 billion gain in U.S. agricultural output and a 0.5% increase in agricultural employment. Dairy product exports would increase by $1.85 billion (18%), while processed foods and beef would see gains of $1.54 billion (3.8%) and $875 million (8.4%) respectively. Corn and rice exports could be slightly lower. The TPP would boost U.S. farm income by $4.4 billion per year once fully implemented, with the majority of the increase concentrated in Japan and Vietnam. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports ratification of the TPP, projecting increased exports of dairy products, processed foods, and beef. This would result in a significant gain in U.S. agricultural output and employment. The TPP agreement would impact market access for various agricultural commodities and food products. Japan, the largest U.S. export market for beef, would reduce tariffs on beef products over a transition period, with Japan dropping its current tariff on beef from 38.5% to 27.5% in year one, and eventually to 9% by year 16. Vietnam would also eliminate tariffs on beef products over three to eight years. The United States would eliminate tariffs on beef and beef products within 15 years, with most instances seeing tariffs removed in fewer than 10 years. Japan would immediately cut its tariff on pork cuts to 2.2% and phase out the residual over nine years. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on pork and pork products within 10 years, while the United States would immediately eliminate most such tariffs. Canada would allow incremental increases in access to its poultry and egg markets over five years. Under the TPP agreement, Canada would allow incremental additional access to its highly protected dairy product markets amounting to 3.25% of its output for 2016 under TRQs that would be phased in over five years. This additional access would amount to about 0.3% of current U.S. milk production and would be open to all TPP countries. Under the TPP agreement, TRQs for dairy products like milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt would increase over 14 to 19 years and then remain fixed. Canada would allow duty-free entry for in-quota dairy products and eliminate its 208% over-quota tariff on whey powder over 10 years. Japan would remove tariffs on cheese imports within 16 years and on whey within 21 years. The US would phase out tariffs and establish TRQs for dairy products from Australia and New Zealand, with perpetual TRQs for Australian dairy products. New TRQs for Canadian dairy products in the US would increase annually until year 19, with specific TRQs for various dairy products. Japan would create a new CSQ for corn and corn products. Japan would establish a new country-specific quota for U.S. corn and potato starch, increasing to 3,200 tons in six years. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on corn and soybean products within specific timelines. Japan would also lower government-imposed markups on wheat imports over nine years. Japan would establish new duty-free, country-specific quotas for U.S. wheat and processed wheat products, with gradual reductions in markups over several years. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on certain agricultural products within specific timelines. Japan would also establish a new TPP-wide quota for barley, with a progressive reduction in markups over nine years. Japan would reduce its maximum markup on quantities under the TRQ from 7.6 yen to 4.4 yen over nine years and eliminate tariffs on feed barley. New duty-free CSQs would be created for U.S. unroasted and roasted malt, with increasing tonnage limits over several years. A duty-free quota for U.S. rice would be established at 50,000 tons initially, rising to 70,000 tons in year 13. U.S. tariffs on rice products would be eliminated within 15 years. Vietnam's tariffs on cotton would be eliminated in four years. Cotton: Vietnam's tariffs on cotton, up to 10%, would be eliminated in four years. U.S. tariffs on cotton, up to $0.314 per kg, would be removed within 10 years. Tree Nuts: Japan would immediately eliminate tariffs on certain nuts. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on walnuts and almonds within three years. Citrus Fruits: Japan would phase out tariffs on oranges over six to eight years. The higher tariff period for citrus fruits would be shortened to December through March, with a safeguard for seven years. Tariffs on grapefruit, orange juice, and grapefruit juice would be phased out over six to eight years. Japan's tariffs on non-citrus fruits like fresh apples, cherries, grapes, and raisins would be reduced or eliminated in stages over the next five to ten years. The United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, and Canada would eliminate or reduce tariffs on various fruits like nectarines, plums, strawberries, and sugar products. The US would also expand access to its sugar market through new quotas. The U.S. sugar imports are required, with additional TRQs expected to expand access to the market. Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on various sweetener and tobacco products over time. Vietnam would create a TRQ for unmanufactured tobacco imports that would increase annually. The TPP agreement includes tariff elimination for tobacco products over 16 years, with controversy over excluding tobacco manufacturers from ISDS protections for tobacco control measures. USDA provides detailed summaries on market access for various farm commodities and food products under the agreement. The TPP agreement includes provisions beneficial to U.S. agriculture, such as rules of origin, SPS, agricultural biotechnology, GIs, export programs, and TBT. Only goods of TPP origin can receive preferential tariff rates and TRQs. Criteria for determining TPP origin include products grown, raised, or obtained in TPP countries. The TPP agreement outlines criteria for determining the origin of goods, with a de minimis provision allowing for non-TPP content up to 10% of the transactional value. Exceptions to this rule include certain agricultural products like dairy, edible oil-bearing crops, citrus juices, and non-TPP fruits used in production. Tariff rates have been lowered for food products under the agreement. The TPP agreement addresses non-tariff barriers in trade, specifically focusing on sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) related to food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. It goes beyond the WTO SPS agreement by including obligations such as risk assessment, transparency, and rapid response to issues. TPP countries are required to base SPS measures on international standards or scientific evidence, allow for public comment on measures, and provide rapid notification of importation delays. The TPP agreement requires rapid notification of importation delays and addresses non-tariff barriers related to food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. It establishes procedures for resolving SPS disputes and encourages information sharing on agricultural biotechnology products to minimize disruptions in trade. The working group facilitates information exchange on trade issues related to biotech products. Parties are not obligated to change existing laws. Geographical Indications protect product quality and reputation. GIs can be valuable and provide relief from infringement. GIs are often applied to wines, spirits, and agricultural products. Controversy arises in international trade over protected GIs vs. generic names. Examples include Parmesan cheese and Champagne. The generic name for cheese in the United States is not recognized as \"feta\" in the European Union due to protected Geographical Indications (GIs). The TPP agreement requires transparency in recognizing GIs and provides a process for canceling GI protection. Parties can object to a GI if it causes confusion with a trademark, has a pending application, or is a customary term in a country's language. TPP members are not required to recognize a GI if it is identical to a grape variety's customary name in their territory.

Members are not required to recognize a GI if it is identical to a grape variety's customary name in their territory. Additionally, signatories commit to eliminating export subsidies, setting a standard for future multilateral reform. The TPP agreement sets standards for future reform on a multilateral basis, including commitments around export credits and cooperation on developing multilateral disciplines. It also discourages restrictions on exports of food and agricultural products, limiting such restrictions to 6 months and requiring consultation with TPP importing countries if imposed for more than 12 months. Additionally, the agreement addresses technical barriers to trade, with specific relevance to food and agriculture in the annexes to the TBT chapter.

It also discourages restrictions on exports of food and agricultural products, limiting such restrictions to 6 months and requiring consultation with TPP importing countries if imposed for more than 12 months. The agreement provides common definitions for wine and distilled spirits, limits information requirements for prepackaged foods and food additives, and encourages cooperation on organic products among TPP members. Numerous food and agricultural organizations have expressed support for the TPP agreement since its issuance on November 5, 2015. These include the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Peanut Council, American Seed Trade Association, American Soybean Association, International Dairy Foods Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Chicken Council, National Cotton Council, U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, National Corn Growers Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, Sweetener Users Association, and United Fresh. Several agricultural organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Pork Producers Council, U.S. Dairy Export Council, and U.S. Grains Council, supported the TPP agreement. Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees also endorsed the agreement, with the ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables highlighting benefits for growers and marketers. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners and Sweetener Products unanimously agreed that the TPP met negotiating objectives set by Congress. The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised aspects of the TPP agreement but did not endorse it outright. Criticisms included dairy product TRQs from Canada and Japan and a product-specific exception for tobacco products. Groups opposing TPP include the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA, U.S. Rice Producers Association, and UFCW. UFCW faults the agreement for lacking an enforcement mechanism against currency manipulation. USA Rice, among other agricultural interest groups, has not taken a clear stance on the TPP agreement. Trade ministers from the 12 negotiating countries signed the agreement on February 4, 2016. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force, with no time limit for action until legislation is introduced. Congress would then have up to 90 days to vote on the bill without amendments."
