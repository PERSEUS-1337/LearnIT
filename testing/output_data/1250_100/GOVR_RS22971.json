    "content": "Congressional and consumer interest in passenger natural gas vehicles (NGVs) has increased due to higher gasoline prices, environmental concerns, and policy proposals like the \"Pickens Plan.\" Despite availability for years, NGVs are mainly used in government and private fleets, with limited consumer adoption. Larger NGVs, such as transit buses and delivery trucks, receive incentives but face high costs and infrastructure challenges. In 2009, the Energy Information Administration estimated 114,000 CNG vehicles and 3,000 LNG vehicles in the US, with two-thirds being light-duty vehicles. In 2009, only 0.004% of new light-duty vehicles sold were NGVs. Currently, only two passenger NGVs are available for purchase by consumers. The purchase prices for NGVs are higher than conventional vehicles, but fuel cost savings over the vehicle's life can offset this difference. A tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles has expired, and the number of natural gas refueling stations is limited. The limited availability of natural gas refueling stations poses a challenge for purchasers of new NGVs. A home refueling system can be installed at a cost of $3,400 to $4,500, with a potential tax credit of $1,000 available until 2011. Annual fuel cost savings from switching to natural gas could be around $600, but the payback period for the CNG vehicle and refueling system is over 17 years, which may not be acceptable to some consumers. The payback period for CNG vehicles can be significantly reduced by factors such as fuel price differences, lower discount rates, or decreasing natural gas vehicle prices in the future. Other benefits of NGVs include reduced petroleum dependence, lower emissions, and domestic production of natural gas. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have benefits such as reduced petroleum dependence, lower emissions, and domestic production of natural gas. However, there are drawbacks to NGVs, including lower power, slower acceleration, shorter range, and reduced cargo space due to larger natural gas storage tanks. Converting existing vehicles to operate on natural gas is technically feasible with few problems. Converting existing vehicles to operate on natural gas involves changes to the fuel system, including a new fuel tank, fuel lines, and modifications to the vehicle's electronic control unit. EPA restrictions on fuel conversions have been reduced recently, but in the United States, NGV conversions can potentially violate the Clean Air Act. Vehicles must pass rigorous emissions tests, and any modifications to the exhaust, engine, or fuel systems after EPA certification may be considered tampering under the CAA. The EPA interprets tampering as any changes to a vehicle's engine or fuel systems that increase pollutant emissions after sale. In the 1990s, concerns arose about converted vehicles exceeding emissions standards, prompting stricter regulations. In 1997, the EPA tightened testing standards for LPG vehicle conversions due to concerns about emissions exceeding standards. The process of certifying vehicle conversions was costly, with each vehicle needing independent certification. Universal \"conversion kits\" were effectively prohibited, and it could cost up to $200,000 to certify a conversion for a single engine family. EPA issued final regulations on alternative fuel vehicle conversions in 2011. EPA issued final regulations on alternative fuel vehicle conversions in 2011, providing new flexibility for converters to certify their conversions without violating anti-tampering provisions. Requirements for \"new and relatively-new\" vehicles remain mostly unchanged, while regulations for \"intermediate age\" and \"outside of useful life\" vehicles have been relaxed, leading to reduced certification costs. EPA's certification now expires after one year, but the waiver of anti-tampering provisions remains in effect as long as the conversion kit is not modified. The expiration of vehicle certification may raise concerns, but conversions would not violate the Clean Air Act. Vehicle systems directly modified by the conversion may void the original manufacturer's warranty, but the conversion manufacturer's warranty would cover those systems. Bills like the Nat Gas Act aim to promote NGVs and infrastructure with incentives like reinstating tax credits and grants for automakers. The interest in natural gas vehicles (NGVs) has increased due to higher gasoline prices and concerns about U.S. oil dependence. However, the market for NGVs is limited, with few new passenger vehicles capable of running on natural gas. To promote the expansion of NGVs, new incentives such as tax credits and grants for automakers, as well as EPA regulations on conversions, may be necessary."
