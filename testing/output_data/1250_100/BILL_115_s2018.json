    "content": "The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit by eliminating the existing credit and inserting a new section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"American Family Act of 2017\" introduces a Child Tax Credit allowing a credit for qualifying children based on their age and the taxpayer's income. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is the adjusted gross income increased by any amount excluded from gross income under specific sections. The threshold amount varies based on marital status, with different amounts for joint returns, individuals not married, and married individuals filing separately. The applicable amount is determined by dividing the credit allowable under subsection (a) by a specific calculation. The tax code defines a qualifying child as a dependent under 19 years old, with exceptions for non-citizens. The $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) will be adjusted for inflation after 2017. The tax code requires taxpayers to include the name and taxpayer identification number of any qualifying child on their tax return. The taxpayer's identification number must have been issued before the due date for filing the return to qualify for the credit. Any increase in the credit amount must be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. No credit shall be allowed for a taxable year less than 12 months, except in case of taxpayer's death. Restrictions apply to taxpayers who fraudulently claimed credit in prior years, with disallowance periods of 10 years for fraud and 2 years for reckless claims. The taxpayer's claim of credit under this section may be denied for reckless or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, but not fraud. If denied credit, the taxpayer must provide necessary information to demonstrate eligibility in subsequent years. The credit allowed for a taxable year will be reduced by any advance payments received. Excess advance payments under section 7527A will increase the tax imposed for the taxable year if they exceed the credit allowed. A new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows for advance payment of the credit. \"Section 7527A allows for advance payment of child tax credit.\" The Secretary shall establish a program for making advance monthly payments of the credit allowed under section 36C to taxpayers, with limitations on the total amount of payments made to any taxpayer during the taxable year. The Secretary will establish a program for advance monthly payments of the credit under section 36C to taxpayers, with efforts to apply the limitation of section 36C(b) for payments made under the program. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS will implement a program for advance monthly payments of the child tax credit under section 36C, with adjustments to adhere to the credit limitation. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the advance payment of the child tax credit under section 36C. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the advance payment of the child tax credit under section 36C, including changes to section 24(e) and 32, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2016."
