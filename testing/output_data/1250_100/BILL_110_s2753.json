    "content": "The \"Credit Card Reform Act of 2008\" is also known as the Credit Card Reform Act. It aims to protect young consumers from prescreened credit offers. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to allow consumers aged 21 or older to authorize inclusion in lists provided by consumer reporting agencies. Additionally, consumers aged 18 and above may opt-in to include their name and address in such lists. Consumer aged 18-20 can choose to have their information included in consumer reporting agency lists for credit or insurance transactions not initiated by them by notifying the agency in writing. Consumer aged 18-20 can elect to be included in a consumer reporting agency list until their 21st birthday or until they notify the agency that the election is no longer valid. This election applies to all agency affiliates and does not limit the subsection's applicability. Consumer aged 18-20 can choose to be on a consumer reporting agency list until they turn 21, and can opt out after their 21st birthday. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON UNILATERAL CHANGES IN CREDIT CARD AGREEMENTS. Chapter 4 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include a new section 171, which prohibits credit card issuers from making unilateral changes to credit card agreements before the contract expires or renews. Cardholders also have the right to repay all existing balances on a terminated or expired credit card account. The Truth in Lending Act prohibits credit card issuers from making unilateral changes to credit card agreements before the contract expires or renews. Termination of an account due to refusal to renew or failure to agree to new terms does not constitute a default or trigger immediate repayment obligations for the cardholder. Changes in terms must be disclosed prior to renewal. The Truth in Lending Act prohibits credit card issuers from making unilateral changes to credit card agreements before the contract expires or renews. Changes in terms must be disclosed prior to renewal, as stated in the recent amendment to the Act. SEC. 4. STOPPING UNFAIR INTEREST RATES AND FEES. Prohibition on unilateral changes in credit card agreements. Section 163 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include limits on interest rate increases for credit card accounts under an open end consumer credit plan. The creditor cannot increase any annual percentage rate, fee, or finance charge before the scheduled renewal date of the plan, except in specific circumstances such as the expiration of an introductory rate or the application of a disclosed variable rate. The Truth in Lending Act limits interest rate increases for credit card accounts under an open end consumer credit plan. A creditor can only impose an increase in the annual percentage rate as a penalty for specific actions or omissions directly related to the account, as specified in the contract. Information not directly related to the account, such as adverse consumer information or changes in credit score, cannot be used as reasons for a penalty rate increase. The Truth in Lending Act limits penalty interest rate increases on credit card accounts. A creditor cannot raise the annual percentage rate by more than 7 percentage points above the previous rate. Additionally, any rate increase can only apply to new credit extensions, not retroactively to existing balances. SEC. 5. CAP ON FEES CHARGED BY CREDITORS. Section 164 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include limitations on late payment fees for credit card accounts under open end consumer credit plans. Credit card issuers must clearly state the payment due date and late payment fee on billing statements to avoid adverse consequences for consumers. The Truth in Lending Act now limits late payment fees for credit card accounts. Card issuers cannot impose fees or raise rates if payment is made on time. Fees must be reasonable and related to the cost of the default. The Truth in Lending Act limits late payment fees for credit card accounts, prohibiting card issuers from imposing fees or raising rates for on-time payments. The Act also requires fees to be reasonable and related to the cost of the default. Additionally, the Act mandates the Board to promulgate regulations to enforce these limitations. A conforming amendment to the Act strikes paragraph (12) of Section 127(b). SEC. 6. VERIFICATION OF ABILITY TO PAY CREDIT OBLIGATIONS. Section 127 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to require credit card issuers to verify a consumer's ability to pay before opening a new account or increasing credit limits. The Board will establish regulations for determining this ability based on income, obligations, and employment status. Prohibited acts or practices related to credit card accounts will also be addressed. The Board will identify credit card accounts that are unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade regulations, as well as those associated with abusive lending practices or not in the consumer's interest. SEC. 7. CURBING DECEPTIVE CREDIT CARD OFFERS. Section 603(l) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to define a \"firm offer of credit or insurance\" as an offer that specifies all terms and will be honored if the consumer meets specific criteria based on their consumer report. The offer must disclose the annual percentage rate, fees, and credit limit. The offer may be conditioned on verifying the consumer still meets the criteria. The consumer's credit worthiness or insurability can be determined for an offer by using information from a consumer report or application. Collateral requirements must be established before the offer and disclosed to the consumer. The amendments made by sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of this Act will take effect 6 months after enactment, with the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System starting to propose regulations to implement the amendments on or after the enactment date."
