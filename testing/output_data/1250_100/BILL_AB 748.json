    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 75.21 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to provide exemptions for supplemental assessments, as long as the property is not already receiving another exemption and the assessee is eligible. If the property had a previous exemption and the assessee is eligible for a greater exemption, the difference in amounts will be applied to the supplemental assessment. Any person eligible for an exemption against a supplemental assessment must file a claim within 30 days of notice to receive a 100% exemption. Unclaimed exemptions for property eligible for various exemptions will be canceled or refunded. For supplemental assessments, exemptions can be claimed to receive a reduction in tax, penalty, or interest. The exemption amount is 90% if filed before the first installment becomes delinquent, and 85% if filed thereafter. Provisions of Section 254.5 apply to property eligible for welfare or veterans' organization exemptions. For property eligible for veterans' or homeowners' exemption, a timely application must be filed to receive a cancellation or refund of tax. 80% of the exemption amount will be refunded if the application is filed before the first installment becomes delinquent. For disabled veterans' exemption, 90% of the exemption amount will be refunded if the application is filed on time, and 85% if filed thereafter. For property with other available exemptions, a timely exemption application must be filed to receive a cancellation or refund. Ninety percent of tax or penalty will be refunded if filed before the first installment becomes delinquent, and eighty-five percent if filed thereafter. Late filing provisions do not apply to assessments under this chapter. For the homeowners\u2019 exemption, veterans\u2019 exemption, or disabled veterans\u2019 exemption, a previously filed claim remains valid. A claim for these exemptions for a single supplemental assessment occurring between June 1 and December 31 applies to that assessment. For two supplemental assessments occurring between January 1 and May 31, one for the current fiscal year and one for the following fiscal year, a claim for these exemptions applies to both assessments. If granted, the exemption remains valid until the property changes ownership or becomes ineligible. An additional exemption claim may not be required for a supplemental assessment resulting from new construction on previously exempted property. In cases of a change in property ownership where the new owner already owns other exempted property, no additional exemption claim is needed. Otherwise, an application for exemption must be filed as per subdivision (c) of Section 271 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Section 271 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows for the cancellation or refund of taxes, penalties, or interest on property acquired by qualified organizations for specific exemptions within a certain timeframe. Property acquired by qualified organizations for specific exemptions within a certain timeframe shall be canceled or refunded based on certain conditions, including the type of property and the duration of qualification for the exemption during the fiscal year. Section 271.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to provide cancellation or refund of taxes, penalties, or interest on properties eligible for exemption under specific conditions. Taxes exceeding $250 will be refunded if imposed on qualified properties with exemption claims filed. Pro rata portions of taxes on properties acquired during the fiscal year will be considered for cancellation or refund. Section 271.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to state that if property receiving certain exemptions is sold or transferred, the exemption will cease and a new exemption may be available. Termination of the exemption will result in an escape assessment. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
