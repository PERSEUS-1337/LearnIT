    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006\" and pertains to alternative energy refueling systems. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include definitions for alternative energy refueling systems, which are used to refuel vehicles with various alternative fuels. Eligible entities are defined in the Act. The Solid Waste Disposal Act defines eligible entities as refueling vendors or owners/operators of facilities with alternative energy refueling systems. The Administrator will establish a reimbursement program for eligible entities to cover costs of purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems. The Administrator will provide reimbursement to eligible entities within 30 days of verifying the installation and operation of an alternative energy refueling system. An eligible entity cannot receive dual benefits if they already received a tax credit under section 30C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An eligible entity cannot receive reimbursement for an alternative energy refueling system if the cost was considered in calculating a tax credit. The entity is limited to 2 alternative energy refueling systems per facility. The reimbursement for an alternative energy refueling system is capped at 30% of the system's cost or $30,000. The Administrator cannot use Trust Fund funds designated for other projects. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 amend Section 9508(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The owner or operator must still comply with other provisions of this subtitle."
