    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Land Exchange Act of 2002\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has proposed a land exchange with the National Park Service to acquire the Yellow Face tract, benefiting the public by preserving important views and habitat for endangered species. The proposed land exchange with the National Park Service would benefit the Eastern Band by reclaiming the Ravensford tract, part of their ancestral homeland, and addressing the critical need to replace the current Cherokee Elementary School. The Eastern Band plans to construct a new three-school campus to preserve Cherokee traditions and reunify tribal lands. The educational village will teach Cherokee language and culture alongside the standard curriculum, benefiting the American public. The land exchange involves the Ravensford tract, free of threatened or endangered species, and the Yellow Face tract, with listed species and a higher value. Past approvals by Congress and the Department of the Interior support such land exchanges for mutual benefits. The Act aims to acquire the Yellow Face tract for National Park preservation and transfer the Ravensford tract to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for an education facility, promoting cultural integrity and partnerships within ancestral homelands. The Act includes a provision for a land exchange. The Secretary of the Interior will exchange the Ravensford tract in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for the Yellow Face tract near the Waterrock Knob Visitor Center on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The United States will hold the Ravensford tract in trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as part of the Cherokee Indian Reservation upon receiving the Yellow Face tract. The Eastern Band will deed parcels 88 and 89 of the Hornbuckle Tract in North Carolina for the exchange. The lands within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, known as the Ravensford Tract, consisting of 144 acres, will be held in trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The Secretary of the Interior will provide legal descriptions of the areas to the relevant committees within a year of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary may correct errors in legal descriptions filed for public inspection in National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. Government-to-Government Agreements will be established between the National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for cooperative partnerships and consultations regarding construction on the Ravensford tract. The National Park Service is authorized to enter into agreements with the Eastern Band for training, management, and preservation of natural and cultural resources. Construction standards will be developed in agreement with the Eastern Band to minimize adverse impacts on resources while meeting educational facility needs. In employing individuals for work in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, preference will be given to qualified members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The development on the Ravensford tract must adhere to environmental sustainability standards based on best practices. SEC. 5. GAMING PROHIBITION. This Act does not allow gaming on lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior in trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe after October 17, 1988."
