The \"Honoring Every Requirement of Exemplary Service Act of 2005\" or the \"HEROES Act of 2005\" includes enhancements to the death gratuity, increasing it to $100,000 for deaths resulting from combat-related causes or causes incurred in designated operations or areas. The HEROES Act of 2005 enhances the death gratuity to $100,000 for combat-related deaths. Subsection (d) is amended to include death gratuities under subsections (a) and (c). Additional gratuity is required for deaths before the effective date. The HEROES Act of 2005 increases the death gratuity to $238,000 for members of the Armed Forces who died as a direct result of wounds, injuries, or illnesses incurred in specific operations. Beneficiaries entitled to the regular military death gratuity will also receive the additional death gratuity. The additional death gratuity is payable to beneficiaries entitled to the regular military death gratuity. The amount payable to each beneficiary is determined based on the ratio of their share of the regular military death gratuity to the total amount payable to all beneficiaries. Definitions for \"additional death gratuity\" and \"regular military death gratuity\" are provided in this subsection. SEC. 3. SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE ENHANCEMENTS.
