    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the Federal Reserve System to regulate various consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has authority over deposit taking, mortgage lending, credit card lending, loan servicing, debt collection, and other financial activities. It serves as the primary federal supervisor for institutions offering these services and can implement regulations for existing consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate consumer financial products and services. The Bureau's powers became effective at different times, with most going into effect on the designated transfer date of July 21, 2011. The appointment of a Director also affects the Bureau's authority to exercise its powers. The CFP Act allows the Secretary to exercise some Bureau authorities until a Director is appointed. Section 1066 grants the Secretary interim powers over the Bureau, including providing administrative services before the transfer date. The definition of \"administrative services\" is not specified, raising questions about its interpretation. The Treasury Department's administrative support powers under section 1066(b) went into effect on the date of enactment and terminate on the designated transfer date. The Secretary's interim authorities under CFP Act subsection 1066(a) allow for performing limited functions of the Bureau until a Director is confirmed by the Senate. Unlike the temporary administrative powers, these authorities do not expire until a Director is appointed. The CFPB's authorities under subtitle F do not go into effect until the designated transfer date. Subtitle F transfers consumer financial protection functions from seven agencies to the Bureau, including rulemaking authority under consumer financial laws. The CFPB's authorities under subtitle F, including rulemaking authority under consumer financial laws, are transferred from seven agencies to the Bureau. This includes primary enforcement authority over larger depository institutions and the coordination of personnel transfers to the CFPB. The transfer of personnel must be completed within 90 days of the designated transfer date. The Bureau will gain authorities under subtitle F on the designated transfer date, allowing the Secretary to exercise these powers until a CFPB Director is appointed. These powers include consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions, rulemaking abilities for 18 consumer laws, and administrative support functions. The authorities under subtitle F do not cover all of the CFPB's powers, as the Bureau also has newly established consumer protection authorities granted by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB's newly established authorities under the Dodd-Frank Act include enhanced supervisory powers over non-depository financial institutions, new rulemaking powers, and consumer compliance enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions. The Bureau can supervise non-depository providers of payday loans, mortgage loans, mortgage brokerage services, foreclosure relief services, and student loans, with flexibility to identify other institutions for supervision. The CFPB has enhanced supervisory powers over non-depository financial institutions, including the authority to conduct examinations, impose reporting requirements, and enforce consumer compliance. These powers allow the Bureau to supervise non-depository institutions similar to how federal banking regulators oversee depository institutions. Additionally, the CFPB can require these institutions to register, meet eligibility standards, and enforce consumer compliance. The CFPB has expanded its supervisory powers over non-depository financial institutions, allowing it to conduct examinations, impose reporting requirements, and enforce consumer compliance. The Bureau's rulemaking powers, outlined in sections 1022 and 1024 of the CFP Act, enable it to prescribe regulations, issue orders, and provide guidance to administer federal consumer financial laws effectively. Subtitle C grants the CFPB the authority to issue specific regulations, such as declaring acts or practices related to consumer financial products as unfair, deceptive, or abusive. The CFPB's enforcement and supervisory powers over smaller depository institutions are limited, with the Bureau playing a back-up role to their banking regulators. The CFP Act allows the Bureau to refer potential enforcement actions against smaller depository institutions to their regulators and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. The Bureau can access examination reports prepared by banking regulators and may require smaller depository institutions to submit reports directly. The Bureau's limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions will take effect on the designated transfer date. The CFPB's limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions will take effect on the designated transfer date. The newly established powers are not considered \"administrative services\" and may not be exercised until a Bureau Director is appointed. The actions taken by the Bureau so far have been administrative in nature or in preparation for substantive authorities to be implemented. The Bureau has taken administrative steps such as talking to interested parties, collecting information, coordinating personnel transfers, hiring new staff, securing office space, and conducting planning meetings. These actions align with the Treasury Department's responsibilities and the Bureau's planned activities as outlined in the Federal Register notice. After the designated transfer date, the Bureau will acquire consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions, as well as rulemaking authority under TILA, RESPA, and other consumer laws. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may expand if a Director is not appointed, potentially leading to substantive actions impacting financial institutions. For example, the FRB proposed regulations under TILA to impose origination standards on certain mortgage lenders. The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011. Final regulations imposing mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau, not the FRB. The Secretary may have the authority to issue these regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed. The limits of the Secretary's authorities under the CFP Act may not always be clear. Lawsuits may be initiated against the Secretary for actions exceeding authority under the CFP Act, with unpredictable outcomes due to various circumstances."
