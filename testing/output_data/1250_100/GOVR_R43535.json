    "content": "The House and Senate have not reached agreement on a traditional budget resolution since FY2010. The sustained lack of agreement in recent years has led to calls for budget process reforms, such as replacing the concurrent resolution with a joint resolution requiring the President's signature. Congress has agreed to budgetary constraints in forms other than a budget resolution, such as the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 established enforceable budgetary parameters as alternatives to traditional budget resolutions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, enacted on December 26, 2013, includes provisions titled \"Establishing a Congressional Budget\" to substitute for a traditional congressional budget resolution for FY2014 and potentially FY2015. These provisions are compared to traditional budget resolutions and placed within the context of the budget process for those fiscal years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, enacted on December 26, 2013, resulted from negotiations between the Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees in association with the conference committee on the FY2014 budget resolution. The House and Senate agreed to convene a conference committee to resolve their differences on an FY2014 budget plan. Representative Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray announced a two-year budget agreement on December 10. The \"Ryan-Murray agreement\" was facilitated by a special rule using H.J.Res. 59 as the legislative vehicle. The agreement, known as the Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA), included the \"doc fix\" amendment. Representative Paul Ryan motioned for the House to send the BBA and \"doc fix\" to the Senate as an amendment to H.J.Res. 59, which was approved by the House and later by the Senate through unanimous consent. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA) was signed into law on December 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-67) after passing through the Senate with cloture and a vote to concur in the House amendment. The BBA modified spending caps and extended the mandatory sequester related to the Budget Control Act of 2011. It also included provisions for congressional budget resolutions for FY2014 and FY2015, allowing Congress to function similarly to a traditional budget resolution under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Budget Act enforces budget limits through points of order, with Sections 311 and 302 regulating spending and revenue levels. Section 311(a) prohibits measures that violate budget authority and revenue levels, while Section 302(a) allocates spending by committee. Legislation violating these allocations is generally prohibited. The Budget Act enforces budget limits through points of order, with Sections 311 and 302 regulating spending and revenue levels. Section 302(f) of the Budget Act prohibits spending measures that breach the Appropriations Committees' suballocations made under Section 302(b). When a budget resolution is not reached in a timely manner, enforcement for the upcoming fiscal year becomes complex, with prior year's budget levels remaining in effect. Changing economic conditions and technical factors may have rendered prior budget levels outdated, undermining their value for enforcing current policies. Without a budget resolution, there is no allocation of spending to the Appropriations Committees, leading the House and Senate to use mechanisms like deeming resolutions to establish enforceable budgetary levels. The term deeming resolution is not officially defined, nor is there any specific statute authorizing such legislation. Instead, it represents the House and Senate using legislative procedures to address enforcement issues. Budgetary enforcement has been provided for in statutory budget control legislation, allowing the Budget Committee chair to file a statement of budgetary levels in the absence of a budget resolution. For example, the BCA established enforceable budgetary levels in the Senate for FY2012 and FY2013 if no budget resolution was adopted. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is enforced for fiscal year 2014, with budgetary points of order in prior resolutions also enforced. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to determine its rules of procedure, allowing for enforceable budgetary levels in any legislative vehicle. This includes provisions for FY2015 in both the House and Senate. The use of an alternative legislative vehicle does not impact the enforceability of budgetary levels and other provisions in the BBA. The Budget Act allows Congress to set budgetary levels, which are enforceable even if established in statute. The FY2014 budget resolution in the Bipartisan Budget Act does not include specific dollar amounts but requires subsequent filing of budgetary totals, which become enforceable. Members agreed to this resolution within the BBA. The FY2014 budget resolution in the Bipartisan Budget Act does not specify dollar amounts but requires enforceable budgetary levels to be filed later. This provision is similar to the one in the Budget Control Act, where certain budgetary levels were filed as a \"deeming resolution.\" The levels specified in the Bipartisan Budget Act for filing did not include all required budgetary levels. The Bipartisan Budget Act did not include all required budgetary levels, such as the deficit level and public debt, but did include enforceable levels like overall spending and revenue. The Act functions in place of a traditional budget resolution and refers to previous actions concerning budget resolutions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 includes enforceable budgetary levels for FY2014 and FY2015, referencing previous budgetary actions. It can be supplanted by future actions and has specific provisions for the House and Senate. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 includes enforceable budgetary levels for FY2014 and FY2015, with provisions for expiration if a concurrent resolution on the budget for FY2015 is agreed upon by the Senate and House of Representatives. The Act allows for variations in content, format, and structure, which could impact the privileged nature of a measure intended to be considered as a budget resolution on the House and Senate floor. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 established budgetary levels for FY2014 and FY2015, with provisions for expiration if a concurrent resolution on the budget for FY2015 is agreed upon. The Act allows variations that could affect the privileged status of a measure as a budget resolution. The Act increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set budget levels for FY2014 and FY2015, with provisions for expiration if a budget resolution for FY2015 is agreed upon. It increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2014. A statement was submitted for publication in the Congressional Record detailing committee spending levels for FY2014, which were adhered to in the enacted appropriations. Section 111 also specified levels for mandatory spending and revenue, keeping them at current law levels. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set budget levels for FY2014 and FY2015, with provisions for expiration if a budget resolution for FY2015 is agreed upon. The levels were submitted in the House and Senate in January and became enforceable on the House and Senate floor. The BBA budget resolution included procedural provisions, adjustments, and reserve funds, giving authority to adjust budgetary allocations in the future under certain conditions. The Budget Committee chairman can submit revised levels to the chamber if certain conditions are met, allowing policies to be considered without violating budget resolution levels. Adjustments and reserve funds aim to be deficit-neutral, requiring excess amounts to be offset. Reserve funds may allow breaches in spending or revenue levels if policy legislation meets specified requirements. The reserve fund allows breaches in spending or revenue levels if policy legislation meets specified requirements, as long as it remains deficit-neutral. An example is the DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR A FARM BILL, where the Budget Committee chairman can adjust allocations for bills related to the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 without increasing the deficit. The Senate considered the Agricultural Act of 2014, known as the \"Farm bill.\" Senator Patty Murray revised budgetary levels for the FY2014 budget resolution related to the Farm bill conference report. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allows adjustments for deficit-neutral reserve funds, including one for the farm bill, ensuring it does not increase the deficit over specified periods. The conference agreement on H.R. 2642, the Agricultural Act of 2014, fulfills the deficit-neutral reserve fund conditions for a farm bill. Budgetary aggregates and allocations to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry are adjusted accordingly. Senators have concerns about adjustment provisions potentially allowing legislative questions to pass with a simple majority instead of a three-fifths threshold. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 includes provisions for FY2015 related to a budget resolution, with increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps. If by April 15, 2014, the House and Senate have not agreed on a budget resolution for FY2015, the Budget Committee chairs must submit allocations and levels by May 15 for enforcement. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 sets spending caps for FY2015 at $521 billion for defense and $492 billion for nondefense. If no budget resolution is agreed upon by April 15, 2014, Budget Committee chairs must submit spending levels for FY2015 by May 15. Mandatory spending and revenue levels are to remain consistent with current law. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 establishes enforceable budgetary levels for FY2015. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2015, but the Senate may still consider one. The Budget Committee chairs submitted spending levels for FY2015 as required by the Act. The Senate discharged the House-passed budget resolution for FY2015 (H.Con.Res. 96) to the Senate Budget Committee on April 11. Any Senator can make a non-debatable motion to proceed to consider the budget resolution."
