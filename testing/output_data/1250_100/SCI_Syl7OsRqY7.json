    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but recent studies reveal a limitation in assuming answers and evidence are in close proximity. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a new model that integrates evidence from multiple documents. It includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with respect to the query and a fine-grain module for scoring candidate answers by comparing occurrences across all documents. The CFC achieves a state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the Qangaroo WikiHop task, outperforming previous models by 3% accuracy. This model addresses the need for scalable question answering systems that can reason over multiple documents. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a multi-evidence QA model that selects answers from multiple documents by combining coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning. Inspired by recent studies on question answering, the CFC achieves a state-of-the-art result of 70.6% accuracy on the Qangaroo WikiHop task, outperforming previous models. This model addresses the limitations of existing datasets by focusing on reasoning over multiple documents to provide more accurate answers. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieves state-of-the-art results on the Qangaroo WikiHop test set with 70.6% accuracy, surpassing previous models. It improves exact match accuracy and F1 score on the TriviaQA task by focusing on distinct parts of input through hierarchical attention. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieves state-of-the-art results by aggregating large quantities of references and addressing errors caused by noise in distant supervision. The CFC consists of a coarse-grain module for summarizing support documents and a fine-grain module for retrieving specific contexts for each candidate. The model utilizes coattention and self-attention mechanisms to effectively represent potentially long support documents. The CFC model utilizes coattention and self-attention mechanisms to summarize support documents and compare them to candidate answers. It encodes sequences using bidirectional GRUs and builds codependent representations of support documents and queries. The model computes an affinity matrix between the document and query to facilitate the comparison process. The CFC model utilizes coattention and self-attention mechanisms to summarize support documents and compare them to candidate answers. It computes an affinity matrix between the document and query, followed by summarizing the coattention context using hierarchical self-attention. The CFC model uses coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and compare them to candidate answers. It computes an affinity matrix between the document and query, followed by summarizing the coattention context using hierarchical self-attention. The model then applies a coarse-grain module to produce a fixed-length summary vector of all support documents, which is multiplied with the candidate answer summary to generate a coarse-grain score. In contrast, the fine-grain module identifies the specific context in which the candidate occurs in the supporting documents. The CFC model uses coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and compare them to candidate answers. It identifies the specific context of the candidate in the supporting documents by summarizing mention representations through self-attention. This coattention context is then summarized again via self-attention to produce a fine-grain summary for scoring the candidate. The CFC model utilizes coattention and self-attention to summarize support documents and compare them to candidate answers. It calculates the fine-grain score of candidates by combining coarse-grain and fine-grain scores. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on multi-evidence question answering tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on WikiHop dataset and significant performance improvement on TriviaQA task. The WikiHop dataset facilitates multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in documents with a knowledge base. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves selecting the correct candidate answer from a set based on support documents. The unmasked version represents candidate answers with original text, while the masked version uses placeholders to remove correlations. Official blind test evaluation is done using the unmasked version. The CFC model achieves state-of-the-art results on both masked and unmasked versions of WikiHop, with a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind test set. It outperforms previous models by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The division of labor between coarse-grain and fine-grain modules allows for effective modeling of input. The CFC model achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA datasets by focusing on different parts of the input. It decomposes tasks into proposing candidate answers and reranking them. Ablation study on WikiHop shows the effectiveness of different modules. BiDAF++ is used for span extraction, and CFC is used for reranking. Top 50 answer candidates are obtained from BiDAF++ for reranking. The CFC model improves performance by reranking answer candidates based on F1 score. It enhances outputs from span extraction question answering models, with gains of 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 on TriviaQA dev set. Coarse-grain and fine-grain modules significantly contribute to model performance, while replacing self-attention and bidirectional GRUs has minimal impact. Contextual encodings capturing positional information are crucial for model success. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model in coreference resolution due to exact lexical matching. However, it performs better on examples with a large number of support documents or long support documents. The entity-matching coreference resolution captures dependencies more precisely than hierarchical attention. The CFC model's coattention layers focus on similar phrases between the document and query, while self-attention layers capture entity characteristics. The coattention and self-attention scores align the query to the context in the text. The mentions describe locations in Richmond upon Thames. The summary self-attention focuses on relevant documents for the query. Top support documents provide information on The Troll, its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse. The self-attention and coattention mechanisms in the model focus on relevant information in support documents for the query. Errors in the model are categorized into four types, with the first type being the model aggregating the wrong reference, as seen in an example with the query about the country of citizenship of Jamie Burnett. The errors in the model are categorized into four types: wrong reference aggregation, unanswerable questions, multiple correct answers, and complex relation types. Strategies to reduce errors include using robust pretrained contextual encoders, coreference resolution, and embedding relations using tunable symbolic embeddings. One method to reduce errors in models is to embed relations using tunable symbolic embeddings and fixed word embeddings. Question answering tasks involve aggregating information from various sources like Wikipedia, news articles, books, and trivia. Most QA tasks typically do not require reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence, but the Qangaroo WikiHop dataset encourages this. Another task that requires aggregating information from multiple documents is query-focused multi-document summarization. The development of large-scale QA datasets has led to the creation of end-to-end QA models. Recent advancements in large-scale QA datasets have spurred the development of various end-to-end QA models, including document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, cross-sequence attention models, and the use of reinforcement learning. These models utilize convolutions, self-attention, and reranking techniques to refine span-extraction output. The focus is on information aggregation through neural attention, with a particular emphasis on multi-evidence QA across documents. The CFC introduces a novel approach combining self-attention and coattention hierarchically to create effective conditional and codependent representations for processing potentially long documents. This coarse-to-fine modeling technique gradually introduces complexity to effectively model lengthy texts. The CFC is a state-of-the-art model for multi-evidence question answering, achieving 70.6% test accuracy on the WikiHop task. It combines coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning modules to extract different aspects of input effectively. The model uses simple lexical matching instead of coreference resolution systems. The CFC model achieves high accuracy on the WikiHop task by combining coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning modules.
