    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings of Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, and well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, self-esteem, and overall health. The increasing rates of childhood obesity and its economic impact are also addressed. The importance of physical education for children's health and well-being is emphasized by Congress. Inactivity and poor diet contribute to 300,000 deaths annually in the US. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not as active as recommended, with less than 1 in 4 getting enough vigorous activity. Recommendations for daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12 have not been fully implemented. Every student from kindergarten to grade 12 should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for adopting healthy lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Local educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary outlining plans to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. These programs should include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive development for students. The physical education program aims to promote lifelong healthy habits, social skills, and nutrition education for students. Teachers are encouraged to stay updated on the latest research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not considered part of the curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as large and small student populations. Funding applications can include private and home-schooled students. Reporting is required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving grant or contract funding. The report should detail activities conducted and progress made towards achieving goals. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on programs assisted under this part, their success in improving physical fitness, and recommendations for program continuation and improvement. Additionally, not more than 5 percent of grant or contract funds can be used for administrative costs. The Federal share for project assistance is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations includes $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2004 for this purpose."
