    "title": "AB 1847",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the low participation rate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to supplement the federal EITC for the poorest working Californians. The state aims to inform working poor individuals about the federal and state earned income tax credits to reduce their tax burden, increase their income, and boost the California economy. This will be done through notices from employers and state agencies to ensure eligible Californians claim both credits. The terms \"Employer\" and \"Employee\" are defined for the purpose of providing unemployment insurance in California. The Federal EITC and California EITC are also defined, along with state departments and agencies that serve those who may qualify for these credits. The Medi-Cal program falls under the State Department of Health Care Services. Employers must notify employees about eligibility for federal and California EITC when providing annual wage summaries. State departments and agencies must inform program recipients annually about potential eligibility for federal and California EITC, either between January and April or during regular contact. Communication can be direct or indirect through other entities serving eligible individuals. Effective methods should be used to provide notice, following the language requirements outlined in Section 19854. The employer must provide notification to employees about the availability of federal and California EITC either by handing it directly or mailing it to their last known address. Posting notices on bulletin boards or sending them through office mail does not fulfill this requirement. The notice must contain specific language as outlined in Section 19854 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Based on your annual earnings, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from the federal government. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. It does not affect certain welfare benefits like Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, food stamps, low-income housing, or temporary assistance for needy families. Even if you don't owe federal taxes, you must file a federal tax return to receive the EITC. Contact the IRS for more information on eligibility and how to obtain necessary forms. The California Earned Income Tax Credit (California EITC) is a refundable state income tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. To claim the California EITC, you must file a California income tax return and complete the California EITC form (FTB 3514). Contact the Franchise Tax Board for more information on eligibility and how to obtain necessary forms. Amendments to this section apply to notices furnished on or after the effective date of the act."
