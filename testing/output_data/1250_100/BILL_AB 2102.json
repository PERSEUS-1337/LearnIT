    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Controller, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, will divide the County Tribal Casino Account into Individual Tribal Casino Accounts for each tribe operating a casino in the county. Funds from these accounts will be used to make grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, based on each tribe's contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in the prior fiscal year. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee in each county where Indian gaming is conducted selects grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts or County Tribal Casino Accounts based on established priorities and requirements. The committee is responsible for establishing grant application policies, assessing eligibility, and ensuring grants mitigate the impact of the casino on the applicant. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee determines reimbursement for county administrative costs from the county tribal account, capped at 2 percent per fiscal year. The committee is composed of seven representatives, including two selected by the county board of supervisors. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee is composed of seven representatives, including two selected by the county board of supervisors and three elected representatives from cities near tribal casinos in the county. Additional local representatives may be chosen based on specific criteria. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee consists of seven representatives, including two chosen by the county board of supervisors and three elected from cities near tribal casinos. Two representatives are selected based on the recommendation of tribes paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in each county, or by tribes operating casinos in counties where no tribes contribute. The committee must adopt a Conflict of Interest Code in compliance with legal requirements. Sixty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is allocated for nexus grants to cities and counties impacted by contributing tribes. Grants are determined by a nexus test based on proximity to tribal casinos, with priority given to jurisdictions bordering Indian lands or providing access routes to casinos within four miles. Grants may be awarded on a multiyear basis and administered by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. Twenty percent of the specified amount in subdivision (c) will be awarded to local government jurisdictions meeting two of the nexus test criteria in paragraph (1). If no eligible jurisdiction meets this requirement, the funds will be available for grants to jurisdictions meeting the criteria in paragraph (2) or (3). Twenty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account will be allocated for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants will be available to all local jurisdictions in the county, regardless of specific tribal casino impacts. Grant selection will be done by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county. Multiyear grants may be awarded and accounted for annually. Twenty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is designated for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes not contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants are available to all local jurisdictions in the county, regardless of specific tribal casino impacts. Grant selection is done by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county. Grants are limited to addressing service-oriented impacts and one-time large capital projects related to Indian gaming impacts, subject to the sponsorship of the contributing tribe and committee recommendations. If a county lacks a tribal casino not contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, discretionary grants will be available for distribution to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos. Funds from the County Tribal Casino Account can be released for grants selected by the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee, following specified priorities and requirements. Unallocated funds revert back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Moneys allocated for the 2003\u201304 fiscal year can be spent until December 31, 2004. The priorities for grant moneys from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts include law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, environmental impacts, water supplies, waste disposal, behavioral health, planning, public health, roads, recreation, youth programs, and child care programs. Grant applications must mitigate impacts from casinos on local jurisdictions, and funds must be used for the intended purpose or revert back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants can only finance the proportionate share of expenditures that mitigate impacts from the casino. All grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts require tribal sponsorship and must have a reasonable relationship to casino impact and meet specified priorities. Grants cannot support opposition to Indian gaming and will be terminated if used for prohibited purposes. Unused funds will be reallocated for qualified nexus grants. (j) Local government jurisdictions receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts or County Tribal Casino Accounts must publicly disclose the funding source and the specific casino account it came from. Each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee must submit a list of approved projects for funding from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts to the Controller, who will release the funds to the approved local government entities. Any unallocated funds from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts will revert back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Funds allocated for specific fiscal years must be spent by a certain deadline. The local government receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts must deposit funds in an interest-bearing account for mitigating casino impacts. Any misuse of funds will result in reverting the remaining portion to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Compliance with expenditure requirements must be demonstrated to the county. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts. The Legislature intends to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California."
