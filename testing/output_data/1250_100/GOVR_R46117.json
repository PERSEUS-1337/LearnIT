    "content": "The TEACH Grant program provides grants to students pursuing teaching careers. Recipients must teach in high-need fields for at least four years or repay the grant as a loan. Over 300,000 grants totaling nearly $938 million have been disbursed since 2008. Challenges in administering the program include loan conversions for recipients who fail to submit required paperwork. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges with grant-to-loan conversions due to administrative issues. Two-thirds of recipients are expected to have their grants converted to loans, raising concerns about the program's effectiveness. Congressional attention may focus on program design issues, including identifying qualified teachers, grant benefit size, finding teaching placements, teacher preparation program quality, and the definition of a \"highly qualified teacher.\" Implementation challenges like certification of teaching service and the lack of an appeals process also need to be addressed. The TEACH Grant program was authorized in 2007 under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. It aims to address the shortage of qualified teachers in public schools. Challenges include grant-to-loan conversions, program design issues, and implementation challenges like certification of teaching service and the absence of an appeals process. Lawmakers may need to consider proposed changes and issues related to the program in the 116th Congress. The TEACH Grant program was authorized in 2007 to address the shortage of qualified teachers in low-income schools by attracting high-achieving individuals into the teaching profession through financial incentives to help subsidize the cost of college. This was in response to concerns about retirements, teacher quality standards, and retention issues in low-income schools. The TEACH Grant program aims to attract high-quality individuals to teaching by providing financial assistance upfront to influence career paths. It targets schools and subjects that struggle to retain staff, particularly in low-income areas. Critics argue that the program is poorly targeted and places a financial burden on taxpayers, lacking focus on increasing access to higher education for students in need. The TEACH Grant program underwent changes under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, including the development of a plain-language disclosure form for recipients. Recipients in fields no longer designated as \"high need\" could still fulfill their service requirement by teaching in that field. Extenuating circumstances could waive all or part of the service requirement. The TEACH Grant program, authorized under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, required ED to report to Congress every two years on recipients and schools served. Before TEACH Grants, the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program provided $5,000 per year to top 10% high school graduates for teaching service. The TEACH Grant program was administered as a formula grant to states, which selected scholarship recipients and monitored service requirements. It was repealed in 1998 due to being duplicative and costly to administer. Another similar program is the NSF's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, providing scholarships to STEM majors in exchange for teaching service. The curr_chunk discusses various service payback programs for students, including teaching certification in STEM subjects in exchange for serving as a teacher in high-need areas, military service in exchange for tuition assistance, studying less commonly taught languages in exchange for working in the federal government, and financial support for biomedical research training. The TEACH Grant program offers training to students in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research in exchange for engaging in health-related research or teaching for one year. Eligibility criteria include enrollment in an eligible program, citizenship requirements, and registration with the selective service system for male students aged 18-25. A male student must have registered with the selective service system when 18-25 years of age and maintain satisfactory academic progress. This includes a minimum GPA, passing a minimum percentage of credits, not being in default on Title IV loans, and repaying any fraudulently obtained funds. Disqualification factors include unusual enrollment history, drug convictions, and specific eligibility requirements for the TEACH Grant program. A student at an IHE participating in the TEACH Grant program must be in a TEACH Grant-eligible program of study. The program is for post-baccalaureate students who have completed a bachelor's degree and need courses for teacher certification. Academic achievement requirements include scoring above the 75th percentile on admissions tests or having a GPA of at least 3.25. The TEACH Grant program is the only HEA Title IV program with an academic merit requirement. If a student is a current or prospective teacher applying for the TEACH Grant program for a graduate degree, they must have expertise in a field with a teacher shortage or be using an alternative certification route. A student enrolled in a qualifying program may receive up to $16,000 for a bachelor's degree and post-baccalaureate program combined, with annual TEACH Grant awards of $4,000 each. Graduate students can receive up to $8,000 for a Master's degree. Part-time students are eligible for prorated awards based on attendance intensity. TEACH Grant awards cannot exceed the cost of attendance. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must undergo counseling and sign an Agreement to Serve. They must teach full-time for four years within eight years at a school serving low-income students. They must also meet the requirements of a \"highly qualified teacher\" as defined by the ESEA. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must teach full-time for four years within eight years at a school serving low-income students. Schools serving low-income students are defined as those where more than 30% of children meet a measure of poverty. Recipients must also teach in high-need fields such as bilingual education and English language. Qualifying schools are listed in the annual Teacher Cancellation Low-Income Directory (TCLD). If a school no longer qualifies, recipients can still fulfill their service obligation by continuing to teach there. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must teach in high-need fields, including bilingual education, English language acquisition, foreign language, mathematics, reading specialist, science, and special education. These fields are identified by the federal government, state government, or LEA and approved by ED. Recipients may need to declare a major and take coursework in a high-need field to be eligible for teacher certification. If a field on the Nationwide List is no longer designated as high-need when recipients start teaching, they can still fulfill their service obligation by teaching in that field. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must teach in high-need fields, such as bilingual education, mathematics, and special education. Even if a field is no longer high-need, recipients can still fulfill their service obligation by teaching in that field. After completing or leaving their program, recipients must provide initial and annual certification to the loan servicer, verifying their teaching service or intention to teach in a qualifying position. The loan servicer notifies recipients of certification deadlines and requirements. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must teach in high-need fields and provide initial and annual certification to verify their teaching service. The annual certification date is standardized as October 31 for all recipients. TEACH Grants convert to a loan if recipients do not fulfill service obligations, fail to submit documentation, or complete the required four years of service within eight years. Grant recipients must complete a four-year teaching service obligation within an eight-year period. If enrollment is ceased, the grant converts to a loan unless eligible for a suspension. Various circumstances allow for suspension, such as enrollment in another TEACH Grant-eligible program or military service. TEACH Grant recipients must complete a four-year teaching service obligation within an eight-year period. Suspensions are granted for various reasons, including enrollment in another TEACH Grant-eligible program or military service. Recipients can have their service obligations canceled in case of death or total and permanent disability. Additionally, recipients may be discharged from their obligations if called to active military duty for more than three years. TEACH Grants can be awarded for multiple programs of study, with four years of teaching service required for each program. Eligibility for disbursing TEACH Grants requires meeting general Title IV institutional eligibility requirements. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) to meet specific eligibility requirements for teacher preparation programs. These requirements include providing high-quality teacher preparation, financial responsibility, pedagogical coursework, clinical experience, and supervision and support services for teachers. To be eligible for TEACH Grants, an IHE must meet financial responsibility standards, offer accredited teacher preparation programs, and provide a minimum of 10 weeks of full-time clinical experience. The TEACH Grant-eligible IHE must offer pedagogical coursework, supervision, and support services to teachers. It should provide a two-year program of study acceptable for full credit towards a bachelor's teacher preparation degree or a bachelor's degree in a high-need field. Additionally, it must offer a bachelor's degree or post-baccalaureate program to prepare students to teach in a high-need field. A post-baccalaureate program offered by an IHE that also offers a bachelor's degree in education is not TEACH Grant-eligible. TEACH Grant-eligible programs prepare individuals to teach in high-need fields and lead to a bachelor's or Master's degree. Students can receive subsequent TEACH Grants to complete the program even if it becomes ineligible. Program administration responsibilities are divided among IHEs, the loan servicer, and ED. The TEACH Grant program involves various entities fulfilling specific roles: the Department of Education (ED) sets policy and provides oversight, the Institution of Higher Education (IHE) decides program eligibility and administers grants, and the financial aid office manages student eligibility, counseling, and grant distribution. The TEACH Grant program involves various entities fulfilling specific roles: the Department of Education (ED) sets policy and provides oversight, the Institution of Higher Education (IHE) decides program eligibility and administers grants, and the financial aid office manages student eligibility, counseling, and grant distribution. Grants are disbursed to students and teacher preparation program staff, with IHEs having flexibility in administering TEACH Grants. An ED-contracted loan servicer handles post-disbursement aspects due to the program's unique service payback structure. The ED-contracted loan servicer is responsible for tracking recipients' service obligations for HEA Title IV aid programs. They handle annual certification paperwork, remind grant recipients of deadlines, send quarterly notices on potential loan conversion, track loan repayment, provide billing services, and respond to customer inquiries. The loan servicer manages day-to-day administration while ED sets program policy and provides guidance to the loan servicer and IHEs. The ED oversees the TEACH Grant program by setting policy, providing guidance to loan servicers and institutions, monitoring program compliance, and addressing recipient complaints. They also conduct outreach on student aid and manage grant-to-loan conversions. The TEACH Grant program is treated as a federal credit program, with subsidies estimated annually according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The budgetary cost of direct loans and loan guarantees is measured based on their long-term cost to the government. Loan subsidy cost for TEACH Grants is calculated considering grant-to-direct loan conversion, repayment, and interest rates, excluding administrative costs. Loan terms and conditions include interest subsidies, deferments, and loan forgiveness. The TEACH Grant program is treated as a federal credit program, with subsidies estimated annually according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Loan subsidy costs are accounted for in estimates, with positive costs indicating a cost to the government and negative costs indicating budgetary savings. Subsidy costs are funded through permanent budget authority, while administrative costs are funded separately. The TEACH Grant program is not exempt from sequestration, with reductions in federal spending triggered by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The TEACH Grant program is subject to sequestration, with annual reductions in award amounts since 2013. Over 300,000 grants totaling nearly $938 million have been disbursed. Recent analyses show varying benefit take-up rates and conversion of grants to loans. The Government Accountability Office estimated a 19% grant receipt rate in the 2013-2014 academic year. In the 2013-2014 academic year, 19% of potentially eligible individuals received TEACH Grants. An AIR study found that 63% of recipients had their grants converted to loans by July 2016. ED estimates that 66% of TEACH Grant recipients will fail to complete their service obligation. Congressional interest has been sparked by issues in program design and implementation, with legislative proposals introduced to address them. These issues focus on the program's effectiveness in recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers in low-income classrooms. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges in identifying committed teachers for low-income classrooms. Data shows that some recipients convert their grants to loans because they no longer intend to teach. Early availability of grants may attract individuals who may not have considered teaching otherwise. Some recipients of TEACH Grants may lack a strong commitment to teaching, especially if they accepted the grant early in their academic career. Restricting TEACH Grants to juniors and seniors, who may be more committed to teaching, could lower grant-to-loan conversion rates. Some institutions limit TEACH Grants to upperclassmen and graduate students due to underclassmen changing majors frequently and struggling to maintain the required GPA. The AIR study found no difference in grant-to-loan conversion rates by undergraduate class or graduate school year, except for juniors and first-year graduate students. Data from the Noyce Scholarship study suggests it self-selects candidates committed to teaching, but is less effective as a recruitment tool. The Noyce Scholarship is more likely to influence individuals to teach in high-need schools. The AIR study shows that recipients find the grant more influential for teaching in high-need schools than for entering the teaching profession in general. One proposal suggests limiting TEACH Grants to upperclassmen and graduate students to ensure recipients are committed to teaching in high-need schools. Restricting TEACH Grants may limit recruitment of individuals considering teaching as a career. Some students use TEACH Grants for education funding without intention of teaching. Data shows grant recipients may exceed federal loan limits if grants were loans. Grant program offers up to $4,000/year for eligible students at eligible institutions. The TEACH Grant program offers up to $16,000 for undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students, and $8,000 for graduate students. The low take-up rate of TEACH Grants may be due to academic requirements or the risk of grants converting to loans. Financial incentives need to offset the cost of teacher preparation to effectively recruit and retain teachers in high-need schools. The Noyce Scholarship provides $10,000 per year for undergraduate students in their junior or senior year or graduate studies. An independent evaluator found that 90% of Noyce Scholarship recipients were teaching in high-need school districts. A legislative proposal aims to triple the TEACH Grant award to $12,000 annually but would also double the service requirement to eight years. Increasing the TEACH Grant amount may attract more participants, but failure to complete the service obligation could result in larger loan repayments. The TEACH Grant requires recipients to teach in schools serving low-income students and high-need fields. Despite many eligible schools, finding qualifying employment may be challenging. Increasing the grant amount to $12,000 annually could attract more participants, but failure to fulfill the service obligation could lead to larger loan repayments. The TEACH Grant recipients may struggle to find qualifying positions in high-need fields, leading to failure to fulfill their service requirement. Reasons include not being able to find a job in a high-need field, not wanting to teach in a high-need field, not being offered qualifying positions, or finding higher-paying jobs at non-qualifying schools. Other reasons include confusion about qualifying positions, changes in school designations, or not being certified in a high-need field. The GAO study found that TEACH Grant recipients face challenges in finding and keeping eligible teaching positions in high-need fields. Legislative proposals aim to expand qualifying fields to attract more individuals, but some additional fields may not truly have shortages in low-income schools. Identifying qualifying early childhood programs could also be a challenge for states. The HEA defines early childhood education programs as Head Start or Early Head Start programs, state licensed child care programs, or programs addressing children's development from birth to age six. Institutions may not support students in finding qualifying teaching placements. 70% of IHEs provide placement services for TEACH Grant positions, but these services do not lower grant-to-loan conversion rates. There is no central job search tool for identifying TEACH Grant-qualifying schools and fields. Expanding eligible teaching placements could improve retention rates in the classroom and grant-to-loan conversion rates. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships Program did not require high-need schools for recipients, but teaching in areas with shortages could reduce service length. A report on the program showed that most recipients completed their certification and were teaching, with some repaying the scholarship as loans. The North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program, similar to TEACH Grants, mandates teaching in North Carolina public schools. The North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program, like TEACH Grants, requires fellows to teach in North Carolina public schools. A study found that fellows are more likely to stay in public classrooms for five years or more, but also tend to teach more advantaged students. Expanding eligible teaching placements may go against the program's original goal of supporting low-income schools. Eligibility for TEACH Grants requires a high-quality teacher preparation program accredited by an ED-recognized agency or approved by a state, offering at least 10 weeks of full-time pre-service clinical experience and pedagogical coursework. The program must also provide supervision and support services to teachers. Title II of the HEA requires states and IHEs to publish report cards on the quality of teacher preparation programs. States must develop criteria to assess program quality, identify low-performing programs, and report this information to ED. In 2014, 12 states identified 45 programs as low-performing or at risk. Regulations linking program quality to teacher preparation program ratings were overturned in 2016. The regulations under the Congressional Review Act required states to identify effective teacher preparation programs and report on specific indicators for program performance. Programs identified as low-performing for two out of three years risked losing eligibility for the TEACH Grant program. Arguments for limiting TEACH Grant eligibility to effective programs included increased likelihood of fulfilling service obligations, while concerns against it included potential impact on low-income students entering the teaching profession. One legislative proposal aims to raise standards for teacher preparation programs by requiring them to not be identified as low-performing. This change could affect the eligibility of institutions for the TEACH Grant program, potentially impacting the entry of low-income students into the teaching profession. The TEACH Grant program requires recipients to meet criteria for being a Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) as defined under the ESEA. The ESSA reauthorized the ESEA and removed the HQT definition, affecting the TEACH Grant program. Recipients may need to meet both state and federal standards for teacher quality. Uncertainty remains regarding HQT requirements for service in private schools. A new definition of HQT was proposed with additional requirements for private school teachers. The TEACH Grant program now includes new requirements for private school teachers, such as passing competency tests recognized by multiple states. Implementation issues include challenges with certification of teaching service and the absence of a formal appeals process. Recipients must provide initial and annual certifications of their employment as a teacher in a qualifying position, including documentation of teaching in a low-income school and meeting HQT requirements. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges with annual certification paperwork, leading to issues for recipients. Complaint data shows that 64% of recipients had problems with submitting paperwork, and 41% whose grants were converted to loans did not fulfill service requirements due to certification issues. Anecdotal evidence suggests that students may not fully understand the requirements, despite counseling. Additionally, the ED-contracted loan servicer mistakenly converted 2,252 grants to loans between August 2013 and September 2014. The TEACH Grant program faced challenges with annual certification paperwork, leading to issues for recipients. An ED-contracted loan servicer mistakenly converted 2,252 grants to loans between August 2013 and September 2014. 19% of conversions were due to recipients not understanding grant terms or certification requirements, leading to significant consequences. Recipients whose grants were converted to loans were less informed about certification requirements. Recent news highlighted recipients whose grants were converted to loans for failing to certify on time, despite performing qualified teaching. Failure to certify may occur due to various reasons, such as submitting late or forgetting altogether. The TEACH Grant program faced challenges with annual certification paperwork, leading to issues for recipients. Recently, ED established a standardized annual certification date of October 31 each year to address certification issues. Proposed changes aim to simplify the certification process for recipients. The TEACH Grant program requires recipients to complete qualified teaching for a certain number of years within a specified timeframe. Failure to meet these requirements may result in grant-to-loan conversion unless recipients request otherwise. Errors in this conversion process can have negative consequences, leading some recipients to change their teaching positions for higher-paying jobs to make loan payments. Conversions from grants to loans can occur due to administrative errors, with 2,252 recipients affected from August 2013 to September 2014. Changes have been made to prevent these errors, including system checks and manual reviews by the loan servicer. Recipients who fail to meet teaching requirements may also have their grants converted to loans. Starting in January 2019, the Department of Education (ED) established a reconsideration process for TEACH Grant recipients whose grants had been converted to loans due to late certification paperwork. Recipients were notified via email or could request reconsideration through the loan servicer. As of May 2019, about 38% of the nearly 6,000 applicants had been approved for a reconversion to grants, with less than 0.3% denied. Proposed changes in rulemaking aim to address these issues. The Department of Education established a reconsideration process for TEACH Grant recipients whose grants were converted to loans. Proposed legislative changes include crediting teaching service, suspending service obligations, and providing credit repair support for grant-to-loan conversions. Bills propose a formal appeals process and reinstatement of grants if errors occurred. Additionally, recipients' service obligation periods may be extended for grants wrongly converted into loans. Some legislative proposals aim to amend the TEACH Grant program by allowing partial payback based on service completed, similar to other scholarship programs. This could encourage more students to participate but may detract from the program's goal of retaining teachers in high-need areas. In the 115th Congress, an amendment was proposed to allow teachers with changing roles to continue fulfilling their required teaching service. This could lead to greater retention rates among TEACH Grant recipients, but there are concerns that allowing other positions beyond teaching to qualify may detract from the goal of recruiting and retaining high-quality individuals in the teaching profession. Additionally, there have been proposals to replace TEACH Grants and other student financial assistance programs for teachers with a new program altogether. One proposal suggests providing teachers with a larger loan repayment amount based on their years in a qualifying position to incentivize high-quality candidates to stay in the teaching profession. However, creating a new program may increase costs for the federal government. Some bills have proposed eliminating the TEACH Grant program due to concerns about recipients fulfilling service requirements. The program is seen as a \"risky gamble\" for students, leading to significant debt."
