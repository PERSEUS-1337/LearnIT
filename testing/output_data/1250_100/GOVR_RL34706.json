    "content": "Some individuals in appointed positions in the executive branch may convert to career positions in the Senior Executive Service (SES) or excepted service, a practice known as \"burrowing in.\" This is allowed when following laws and regulations governing career appointments. Conversions often happen during transition periods between administrations. Appointees are typically selected noncompetitively for positions like Schedule C or noncareer SES, with salaries ranging from GS-12 to GS-15 levels. Career employees are chosen based on merit without political influence. The tenure of noncareer and career employees differs, with noncareer employees generally limited to the term of the Administration or serving at the pleasure of the appointing person. Career employees provide continuity regardless of administration changes. Pay, benefits, and job security of career positions contribute to individuals in noncareer positions wanting to \"burrow in.\" This is especially true for those without high-profile jobs or strong backgrounds to transition out easily. The conversion of an individual from an appointed position to a career position, known as \"burrowing in,\" raises concerns about limiting opportunities for other employees and potential conflicts with the new Administration's policies. This practice may increase tension between noncareer and career staff, hindering government operations. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by law and regulations. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by strict procedures outlined in Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These procedures aim to prevent prohibited personnel practices and ensure fair and open selection processes for career employees. Department and agency heads are responsible for enforcing civil service laws, rules, and regulations, as well as informing employees of their rights and remedies. The nine merit principles and twelve prohibited personnel practices outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a72301(b) and \u00a72302(b) must be adhered to in order to maintain a competitive and politically unbiased hiring process. Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations outlines regulations for career appointments, including Civil Service Rules 4.2 and 7.1 prohibiting discrimination based on race, political affiliation, or religious beliefs in the federal government. No inquiries or discrimination based on these factors are allowed, except as required by law. In his discretion, an appointing officer may fill positions in the competitive service based on merit and fitness, without considering political or religious affiliations, marital status, or race. OPM approval is required for certain position details, SES vacancies must be publicly announced, and Career-Reserved SES positions can only be filled by career employees. Financial awards are prohibited for certain appointees during the Presidential Election Period. Certain appointees, known as senior politically appointed officers, are restricted from receiving financial awards. Oversight by OPM and GAO ensures proper procedures are followed when converting employees from noncareer to career positions. OPM requires approval before selecting a political appointee for a competitive service position. Beginning on January 1, 2010, departments and agencies must seek prior approval from OPM before appointing a current or recent political appointee to a competitive or non-political excepted service position at any level. Written authorization from OPM is now required for these appointments. Beginning on January 1, 2010, OPM requires approval before appointing a current or recent political appointee to a competitive or non-political excepted service position. OPM will conduct merit staffing reviews for career SES selections involving political appointees before certification by the QRB. OPM Director John Berry delegated decision-making authority to career Senior Executives to uphold the merit system principles. \"Pre-Appointment Checklists\" are included for Competitive Service and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions. The OPM memorandum includes pre-appointment checklists for Service Positions and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions. The required documentation for submission to OPM includes position descriptions, information on current and proposed appointments, and details on the disposition of any vacated political positions. Additionally, the complete file for merit selection must be provided, including vacancy announcements, recruiting sources, qualification standards, job analysis, and applicant correspondence. The OPM memorandum outlines the required documentation for pre-appointment checklists for Service Positions and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions. This includes position descriptions, information on current and proposed appointments, and details on the disposition of any vacated political positions. Additionally, the documentation must include evidence of fair and open competition, recruiting sources, qualification standards, job analysis, and applicant correspondence. The OPM memorandum requires documentation for pre-appointment checklists for Service Positions and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions, including evidence of fair competition, recruiting sources, qualification standards, applicant information, and veterans' preference consideration. The memorandum also reminds departments and agencies not to create competitive or non-political announcements. OPM cautions against creating or announcing vacancies for political appointees, Schedule C employees, or Noncareer SES employees. The agency also publishes the Presidential Transition Guide for Federal Human Resources Management, offering guidance on ethical conduct, appointments, and compensation. GAO oversees conversions from political to career positions, with the latest evaluation in June 2010 covering 42 agencies and reporting 139 conversions, with 57% occurring in five specific departments. The evaluation of conversions from political to career positions in five agencies found that most conversions were done appropriately, but some may not have followed merit systems principles. Congress monitors these conversions, especially at DHS and DOJ. In the wake of leadership and management issues at DHS post-Hurricane Katrina and DOJ's improper procedures with US attorneys, recommendations were made for transitioning political appointees to career positions. This included appointing experienced professionals like Jay Ahern and Gale Rossides to key roles within DHS agencies. Training and cross-training of senior career personnel were also emphasized for continuity within the department. The DHS initiated a transition plan to ensure continuity of leadership, receiving letters from Congress to examine conversions. Representative Bennie Thompson expressed concerns about filling career positions with political appointees without a competitive process, emphasizing the need for experienced professionals in key roles. Representative Thompson and Senators Feinstein, Schumer, and Lieberman raised concerns about political appointees transitioning into career positions within government agencies, urging vigilance to maintain professionalism and independence. They requested directives to prevent such \"burrowing in\" practices to safeguard against potential disruptions to the new administration's policies. Senator Lieberman requested data on conversions from noncareer to career positions and information on staff responsible for reviewing and approving pre-appointment requests from April 2008 to December 2008. The data requested included the number of requests approved, denied, and withdrawn by OPM, along with timelines and documentation of the review process. OPM responded to Senator Lieberman's request for data on conversions from noncareer to career positions and staff responsible for reviewing pre-appointment requests. The agency rigorously examines each request against legal requirements and additional standards to prevent improper political influence. Requests for conversion to non-SES positions are reviewed by ten staff members, including three career Senior Executives, while requests for conversion to SES positions are reviewed by eight staff members, including two career Senior Executives. In February 2009, Senator Feinstein raised concerns about political appointees being improperly converted to career positions at the Department of Defense. The Washington Post also identified similar conversions at other departments. The OPM carefully reviews requests for conversions to prevent political influence in the hiring process. The Department of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Customs and Border Protection Agency, FEMA, and Labor are examples of \"burrowing in.\" Senators Feinstein and Schumer expressed concern to President Bush about political appointees being converted to career positions. White House policy does not encourage non-career appointees to seek career positions. The White House does not influence career hiring processes for political appointees seeking career positions. The process is managed by OPM, with guidelines for eligibility and selection based on qualifications. Organizations like the Senior Executives Association and AFGE have called for transparency in the conversion process, requesting evidence of fair selection and qualifications for former political appointees transitioning to career roles. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and other organizations have called for transparency in the conversion process of political appointees to career positions. Congress may consider additional oversight measures to ensure proper procedures and transparency in these conversions. Options include directing OPM to report to Congress on its current policy and potentially amending relevant laws for better oversight. OPM could provide information on conversions that did not follow proper procedures and the remedial actions taken. Congress could direct OPM to review awards granted in the executive branch and certify that awards were not granted during the Presidential Election Period. Congress could mandate that annual performance plans include detailed information on conversions during the fiscal year. The President could certify that awards were not granted during the Presidential Election Period. Officials with hiring authority must annually certify understanding of legal requirements on employee conversions and the prohibition on awards during the election period. Training sessions could be provided electronically for officials to review procedures. Failure to follow procedures could impact performance evaluations. GAO and OPM could expedite information on conversions for necessary remedial actions. Congress could increase penalties for violating Civil Service laws. Congress could consider amending Title 5, United States Code to prohibit conversion from political to career positions and create a misdemeanor offense for agency personnel who violate federal hiring statutes."
