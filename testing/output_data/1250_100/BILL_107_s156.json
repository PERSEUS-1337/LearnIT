    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and prevent youth from becoming victims of crime by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more unsupervised time alone, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are dire, and after school programs help address social issues. Governors and law enforcement officials support expanding after school programs. The Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of Police Associations, representing 360,000 police officers, urge public officials to provide after school programs with recreation, academic support, and community service for school-age children and teens in the United States. They emphasize the importance of safe and positive learning environments during after school hours. The Act aims to increase academic success, promote safe after-school environments, provide alternatives to negative activities, and reduce juvenile crime. It also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization. The Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to require recipients to provide a certain percentage of the annual cost of activities from sources other than federal funds. The Century Community Learning Centers Act now requires recipients to maintain their fiscal effort from non-Federal sources for activities funded under the project each year. SEC. 7. USES OF FUNDS.
