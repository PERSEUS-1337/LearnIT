    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, providing consumers with information on how their food is made. Congress recognizes the need for labeling due to material changes in genetically engineered food, and the right of individuals to know for various reasons. Many countries already have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. In 2011, Codex Alimentarius adopted a text allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification can preserve economic value in exports or sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered foods, with exceptions for certain types of foods like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving nucleic acid techniques. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to organisms produced through genetic engineering techniques, including in vitro nucleic acid techniques and cell fusion beyond taxonomic families. Genetically engineered foods must have clear disclosure, with exceptions for certain types of foods like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of genetically engineered material in food and amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding misbranded food. It also mentions the requirement for a guaranty or undertaking for food violations. The curr_chunk explains the requirements for a guaranty or undertaking for food violations, stating that the exclusion from penalties applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. The curr_chunk discusses the prohibition of avoiding responsibility for misbranded food violations through contracts, and the definition of 'genetically engineered' terms. Additionally, it amends sections related to false guaranties and unintended contamination in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for labeling requirements related to unintended contamination of food with genetically engineered material by agricultural producers. Regulations are being established for labeling requirements to comply with section 403(z) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
