    "title": "AB 1640",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to apply to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers, subject to certain laws and regulations. The article excludes certain entities and public employees from its application based on specific criteria outlined in federal and state laws. The article excludes certain public employers participating in a multiemployer plan under the Taft-Hartley Act before 2013, regulated by ERISA. The benefit plan applies to new public employees. Former employees transitioning to a new public employer after 2013 are subject to the retirement plan available to employees hired before 2013. An individual who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, without a separation from employment, and became subject to a different defined benefit plan in a different public retirement system offered by their employer shall be subject to that defined benefit plan as it would have been available to employees first employed on or before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower cost formula before January 1, 2013, they can continue to do so without being subject to certain requirements. However, if a new formula is adopted after January 1, 2013, it must meet specific criteria or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the lower cost formula or an approved one. If a public employer offers a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue to do so instead of a defined benefit pension plan required by this article. However, any new defined benefit plan or formula adopted after January 1, 2013, must meet specific criteria or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the existing defined contribution plan or an approved plan. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before. Other cities in Orange County can join this authority by January 1, 2017, with a limit of three cities. The formation of a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, must not exempt new employees or members from the requirements of the article. New members can only participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System is not required to adopt certain benefit formulas or compensation limitations. This article does not provide membership in a public retirement system for individuals ineligible under the system's rules. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
