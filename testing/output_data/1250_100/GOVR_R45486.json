    "content": "Child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, provide food to children in institutional settings. Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program operate in schools. The Child and Adult Care Food Program offers meals in child care settings, and the Summer Food Service Program provides food during summer months. These programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Child nutrition programs have been funded through annual appropriations acts. In the 114th Congress, efforts to reauthorize child nutrition statutes were initiated but not completed. Legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) died at the end of the Congress. There were no significant reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress, but the 2018 farm bill included some provisions related to child nutrition programs. The 2018 farm bill negotiations raised issues relevant for future Congress reauthorization efforts and policymaking, particularly regarding the nutritional quality and sourcing of foods in schools. Access issues include alternatives to on-site consumption in summer meals and the implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. This report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, drawing examples from legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. References to more detailed information are also provided. The child nutrition programs require school meals to meet specific nutritional requirements for federal reimbursement. These standards were updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which also mandated new nutrition standards for competitive foods. The Act required USDA to issue proposed regulations for competitive foods within one year and for school meals within 18 months after enactment. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated new nutrition standards for school meals within 18 months after enactment. It provided increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the requirements and funding for technical assistance. The nutrition standards were based on Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. The final rules for school meals and competitive foods were published by USDA-FNS in 2012 and 2016, respectively. The updated standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in meals, while also limiting calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins. Milk was restricted to low-fat and fat-free options. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods limited calories, sodium, and fat, while increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins. Milk options were restricted to low-fat and fat-free varieties. Implementation challenges included difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) advocated for changes to the nutrition standards for school meals, while other groups argued for maintaining the standards for children's health. USDA made adjustments to the standards in response to implementation challenges, including removing weekly limits on grains and protein. Congress also enacted provisions to loosen milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule that indefinitely changes aspects of the standards starting in SY2019-2020, allowing flavored, low-fat milk to be offered in school meals. The 2018 final rule modifies milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements for school meals, allowing flavored, low-fat milk alongside unflavored milk, a 50% whole grain-rich requirement, and new sodium limits. Changes to nutrition standards for competitive foods are minimal. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to review and revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. The bill required USDA to review and revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, focusing on research for school-age children, cost considerations, and maintaining healthy meals for students. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the House and Senate during the 114th Congress also aimed to alter nutrition standards, with the House proposing regular reviews and revisions of school meal standards and allowing fundraisers to bypass competitive food standards. The Senate proposed revising whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days of enactment. The Senate proposed revising whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days of enactment, reducing the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delaying the Target 2 sodium requirement for two years. Stakeholders have debated including frozen, dried, and canned fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, with a pilot project funded by the 2014 farm bill testing these alternatives in select states. The pilot project funded by the 2014 farm bill tested incorporating dried and canned fruits in schools, resulting in decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on snack days. Student satisfaction slightly decreased, parents' responses were mixed, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals to allow dried and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in the program have been considered but not enacted. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables, including tree nuts. The Senate committee suggested temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve canned or dried fruits and vegetables. Schools in the National School Lunch Program must comply with Buy American requirements to purchase domestic products whenever possible. The Buy American requirements mandate that schools in the National School Lunch Program purchase domestic products whenever possible. USDA guidance advises on implementing these requirements, including monitoring the USDA catalog for suitable products and incorporating Buy American language in procurement documents. Exceptions can be made by SFAs. The Buy American requirements mandate schools to purchase domestic products whenever possible. SFAs can make exceptions when U.S. products are not available or cost significantly more. State agencies must review compliance and take corrective action when necessary. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce compliance and ensure understanding of responsibilities within 180 days. The provision in the enacted bill amended the definition of domestic products for USDA's enforcement, emphasizing products processed in the U.S. and containing meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities produced domestically. Proponents advocate for stricter requirements due to economic and food safety concerns, particularly regarding sourcing from China. Some argue for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement, citing availability and cost-effectiveness challenges. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. In recent years, policymakers have explored alternatives to congregate meals in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option (SSO), particularly focusing on reaching children in rural areas. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided funding for demonstration projects like the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), which gives electronic food benefits to households with eligible children during the summer months. Participants in the Summer EBT program receive either $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. A study from FY2011 to FY2013 found a decrease in very low food security and improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Funding for Summer EBT projects has been provided by Congress, with the most recent allocation in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $28 million for the Summer EBT demonstration, with awardees including various states and tribal nations. USDA announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating from 2019 to 2021. There were proposals in Congress to expand Summer EBT, including allowing SFSP funding to cover Summer EBT and recommending nationwide expansion over 10 years. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) was funded through the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act and included initiatives to increase meal site operations, add recreational or educational activities, provide meal delivery in rural areas, and offer food backpacks for children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in the meal delivery and backpack programs. However, caution is advised in interpreting results due to small sample sizes and lack of comparison groups. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded the eSFSP, which aimed to increase meal site operations and provide meal delivery in rural areas. Exemptions from congregate feeding requirements were granted to outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat, with meals provided in alternative forms on hot days. Proposals in the 114th Congress suggested allowing offsite consumption of SFSP meals for children in rural and nonrural areas. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. Supporters argue that CEP improves meal access, reduces stigma, and lowers administrative costs. Some have sought changes to the option in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, the House's committee-reported child nutrition reauthorization bill (H.R. 5003) aimed to restrict schools' eligibility for the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to target resources better. CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs, such as the Title I-A program. Some students qualify for free meals, while others may have to pay for reduced-price or full-price meals, leading to concerns about students owing meal costs. The issue of unpaid meal costs in schools has gained attention, with some schools resorting to \"lunch shaming\" practices like taking away hot meals or imposing restrictions on students. Limited national data is available on the prevalence of such practices, but many school districts face financial burdens due to unpaid meal costs. Schools rely on student payments for meals as a primary revenue source, and collecting this revenue is crucial for funding operations. The issue of unpaid meal costs in schools has gained attention, with some schools resorting to \"lunch shaming\" practices. Schools rely on student payments for meals as a primary revenue source, and collecting this revenue is crucial for funding operations. Congress and USDA have taken actions to address unpaid meal costs, with USDA recommending clarifying and updating policy guidance on unpaid meal charges. USDA-FNS required SFAs to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with guidelines on handling unpaid meals. They provided further clarification through webinars and memos. Findings from a 2014 study and a Request for Information showed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school level. Responses indicated a preference for local control over national standards. In the 115th Congress, national advocacy groups supported national standards for school meal programs. Legislation such as the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 aimed to establish guidelines for how schools handle unpaid meal costs. States like Illinois have also passed laws addressing lunch shaming and unpaid meal debts. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced new requirements for schools regarding meal pricing. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced requirements for schools to review and potentially increase prices of paid lunches to ensure children receiving free and reduced-price lunches get the full value of federal funds. Prior to these requirements, federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other meal programs. Some argue that raising prices may reduce participation in paid lunches. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced requirements for schools to adjust prices of paid lunches to match federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. Schools must gradually increase prices if they do not meet the reimbursement difference. Additionally, revenue from nonprogram foods must go to the school food authority-run nonprofit school food service account. The USDA-FNS implemented regulations for school meal pricing adjustments starting in SY2011-2012, with exemptions granted for SFAs in strong financial standing through SY2017-2018. The FY2018 appropriation expanded exemptions, requiring only SFAs with a negative balance to potentially raise prices for paid meals. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses aimed to modify or eliminate the paid lunch equity requirements. The USDA-FNS oversees various food programs including NSLP, SBP, SFSP, and FFVP to ensure healthy meals for children."
