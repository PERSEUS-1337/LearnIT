    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that the right to vote is fundamental and should not be denied based on race, color, gender, or previous servitude. Congress has the ultimate authority over Federal elections to ensure fairness and equal protection. Discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections, including unequal participation and disparities based on where a person lives. The voting rights of individuals with felony convictions vary across states, leading to unequal access to voting. Approximately 3.9 million Americans, including half a million women, are unable to vote due to felony convictions. Disenfranchisement disproportionately affects ethnic minorities. Congress must ensure that state voting laws align with the Constitution to prevent discrepancies in federal elections. Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont do not disenfranchise felons, while other states have varying restrictions. Approximately 3.9 million Americans are disenfranchised due to felony convictions, with 73% not in prison but on probation, parole, or ex-offenders. In some states, ex-offenders face barriers to regaining voting rights, such as requiring a pardon or action from the Governor. Federal offenders also encounter additional obstacles in at least 16 states. In 16 States, Federal offenders cannot use the State procedure for restoring their civil rights. The only method provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights is a Presidential pardon. African American and Hispanic citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised. Congress should address these discrepancies to ensure equal opportunity for Americans to vote in Federal elections. The Act aims to restore fairness in Federal elections and help former offenders reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens of the United States. SEC. 3.
