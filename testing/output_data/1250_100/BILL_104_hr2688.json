    "content": "EXCEPTION FROM PROVISIONS REQUIRING REDUCTION IN ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL LIFE INSURANCE. The amendment to section 8714b of title 5, United States Code, allows for the continuation of additional optional insurance without reduction under certain conditions, such as a designation for payment to a permanently disabled individual. However, reductions may occur if the insurance is not paid as designated or if adequate arrangements are not made for the care and support of the designated individual. The amendment to section 8714b of title 5, United States Code, allows for the continuation of additional optional insurance for a permanently disabled individual. To be eligible for unreduced insurance, the insured individual must elect to pay the full cost as required by regulations. The amendment allows for the continuation of additional optional insurance for a permanently disabled individual by electing to pay the full cost as required by regulations. The election can be terminated if the insured individual revokes it, makes changes in the designation, or no longer meets the requirements for unreduced additional optional insurance. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for certain individuals not otherwise eligible to make an election for additional optional insurance. The election must be made within 1 year of the enactment of the Act by individuals who separated from service during a specific period and would have been eligible if the amendments were in effect. If the election is made, withholdings will be applied prospectively. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for individuals to make an election for additional optional insurance within 1 year of the Act's enactment. If benefits are paid upon the insured individual's death, a reduction will be made to reflect withholdings that would have been made if the amendments were in effect earlier. The Office will notify current and former Federal employees about the Act's enactment and benefits they may be eligible for. The notification will include procedures for making an election under the Act and any other relevant information."
