FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\" is a concise statement indicating the beginning of a section in a document where key findings and the purpose of the content will be outlined. Congress finds that billing practices by telecommunications carriers may not accurately reflect the costs of additional services provided to consumers. Some providers have introduced confusing line-item charges, such as \"Federal Universal Service Fees\", leading to customer confusion about the nature and scope of these fees. The State of New York is considering requiring telecom carriers to disclose fee changes to customers. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners supports accurate customer notice on end user charges. The purpose of the Act is to ensure accurate billing practices by carriers nationwide. The Act aims to investigate telecommunications carriers' billing practices. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting a joint investigation into the billing practices of telecommunications carriers to determine if bills accurately reflect additional fees paid by customers due to regulatory actions since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are investigating whether telecommunications carriers accurately reflect additional fees in customer bills due to regulatory actions since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The investigation includes assessing if fees imposed accurately reflect costs and benefits to carriers.

If bills do not accurately assess fees, disciplinary actions will be taken against the carrier. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have the authority to take actions against carriers if necessary. If they determine that they lack sufficient authority, they will notify Congress. Within 45 days of the Act's enactment, they must submit a joint report to Congress on their investigation results, including any recommendations for further legislative action. SEC. 3.
