This included the release of Alan Gross and a U.S. intelligence asset by the Cuban government, leading to a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba. The new policy focused on engagement rather than sanctions, with steps such as reestablishing diplomatic relations, reviewing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and increasing travel and commerce with Cuba. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing funding for Cuba democracy projects and broadcasting. The law allocated $27.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, with the possibility of transferring funds to the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Cuba also released Ladies in White member Sonia Garro from prison on December 9, 2014. Cuba released Sonia Garro Alfonso, her husband, and a neighbor from prison in December 2014. They were placed under house arrest while awaiting trial, raising concerns about a fair trial. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights reported a high number of short-term detentions for political reasons in 2014, along with 102 political prisoners in the country. These developments highlight ongoing human rights concerns in Cuba. Since the end of the Cold War, Congress has been actively involved in shaping U.S. policy towards Cuba through various legislative measures, including the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. These measures strengthened economic sanctions on Cuba while providing roadmaps for normalization of relations. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, making the U.S. a major source of food imports for Cuba. Recent debates in Congress have focused on U.S. sanctions, particularly on travel restrictions to Cuba. The George W. Bush Administration initially eased restrictions on family travel to Cuba in 2003 but later tightened them. In 2009, Congress eased restrictions on family travel and agricultural exports to Cuba. The Obama Administration further lifted restrictions on family travel, cash remittances, and migration talks in 2009. In 2011, restrictions on educational and religious travel, non-family remittances, and charter flights were eased. In 2014, President Obama announced a shift towards engagement and normalization of relations with Cuba. The report analyzes Cuba's political and economic situation, U.S. policy towards Cuba, and key issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. It includes historical background, current political and economic conditions under Ra\u00fal Castro, and U.S. policy changes from the Bush to Obama Administration. The report also discusses the debate on the direction of U.S. policy towards Cuba and legislative initiatives related to U.S.-Cuban relations. Cuba's history as a Spanish colony, its struggle for independence, and the role of the United States in granting Cuba independence in 1902 are highlighted. The Platt Amendment allowed the US to intervene in Cuba to maintain stability. After the Platt Amendment was repealed in 1934, Cuba's political system saw domination by authoritarian figures. Gerardo Machado became increasingly dictatorial during his presidency from 1925-1933. Fulgencio Batista, a military leader, took control behind the scenes until he was elected President in 1940. Batista's rule turned into a brutal dictatorship after a bloodless coup in 1952, leading to popular unrest and Fidel Castro's rise to power through the 26th of July Movement. Fidel Castro formed the 26th of July Movement in Mexico and returned to Cuba in 1956 to overthrow the Batista dictatorship. After Batista fled in 1959, Castro ruled for over 45 years, consolidating power, repressing dissent, and aligning with the Soviet Union. He declared the Cuban revolution socialist in 1961 and proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist. Cuba became a close ally of the Soviet Union, leading to deteriorating relations with the United States. Fidel Castro ruled Cuba for over 45 years, aligning with the Soviet Union and declaring the Cuban revolution socialist in 1961. The Cuban government enacted a new Constitution in 1976, establishing the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in state and society. Legislative authority is vested in a National Assembly of People's Power, with the president of the Council of State serving as the head of state and government. Castro served in this role until February 2008. Fidel Castro officially stepped down as president of the Council of State in February 2008, confirming his departure as the head of the Cuban government. His decision marked the beginning of a stable political succession to his brother, Ra\u00fal Castro. After Fidel Castro stepped down as President in February 2008, Ra\u00fal Castro officially became Cuba's President, with Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura as the first Vice President of the Council of State. Machado, a hard-line communist party ideologue, was a close friend of Ra\u00fal and seen as his official successor. Ra\u00fal began implementing economic reforms in 2008 while maintaining tight political control. Since Ra\u00fal Castro took over as President in 2008, there have been limited political changes in Cuba, with the government maintaining tight control backed by a strong security apparatus. The Cuban military has gained influence in the government, with key military officers serving as ministers. The Cuban Communist Party made some political changes at its sixth congress in April 2011, including Ra\u00fal replacing Fidel as first secretary and proposing term limits for top positions. The party's leadership structure was also reorganized, with a reduction in the number of members in the Political Bureau and Central Committee. At the April 2011 party congress, Ra\u00fal Castro proposed term limits for top positions in the party and government, aiming for rejuvenation. The January 2012 national PCC conference confirmed this change. Critics have faulted Cuba's leadership for staying in power too long and not passing leadership to a younger generation. The PCC approved a resolution allowing for the replacement of up to 20% of its Central Committee members. In February 2013, elections were held for over 600 National Assembly members and 1,600 provincial government representatives, mostly PCC members. Critics argue that these elections are controlled by the PCC. In February 2013, Ra\u00fal Castro was selected for a second term as president of the Council of State in Cuba, indicating it would be his last term due to new term limits. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado was replaced by Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez as the official successor, signaling a move towards generational change in Cuba's political system. D\u00edaz-Canel, a member of the Politburo since 2003, is described as an experienced manager with good military relations who worked his way up through the party. In February 2013, Esteban Lazo Hern\u00e1ndez was appointed as the new president of Cuba's National Assembly, replacing Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n. Lazo, the highest-ranking Afro-Cuban official, has been involved in top party positions and a vice president of the Council of State. While a generational transfer of power is underway in Cuba, it does not indicate a loosening of the tightly controlled regime. President Castro mentioned a gradual transfer of leadership to new generations. Observers predict a smooth leadership transition in 2018, but there may be an increase in factionalism without Castro. Cuba's Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a pastoral letter in 2013 calling for political reform and dialogue among diverse social groups. The Cuban government has a poor human rights record, restricting freedoms and harassing human rights groups. Two political prisoners conducting hunger strikes have died in recent years. Amnesty International reported in March 2012 on the Cuban government's campaign of harassment against political opponents, despite the release of political prisoners in 2011. The report highlighted ongoing human rights abuses, including intimidation, surveillance, and acts of repudiation. Several prisoners of conscience, such as Iv\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez Depestre, continue to be detained in Cuba. Amnesty International reported on cases of arbitrary detention by the Cuban government, including Iv\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez Depestre sentenced to three years for \"dangerousness\" after a peaceful protest, and the Vargas Mart\u00edn brothers convicted for \"public disorder.\" Other cases included the continued detention of Sonia Garro Alfonso, her husband, and a neighbor since March 2012. Amnesty International expressed concern about fair trials for these individuals. The Cuban government holds a significant number of political prisoners, with concerns raised about fair trials. The number of political prisoners has reportedly increased since 2012, with at least 102 political prisoners estimated in June 2014. In December 2014, Cuba agreed to release 53 political prisoners as part of a deal to restore bilateral relations, but their names have not been disclosed. Short-term detentions for political reasons in Cuba have been on the rise in recent years, with over 8,410 detentions reported from January to November 2014. The number spiked in March 2012 and December 2013, coinciding with significant events. Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 was killed in a car accident in 2012, along with another activist, prompting global sympathy. In a car crash involving Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 in 2012, Jens Aron Modig and Angel Carromero Barrios were also present. Carromero was convicted of vehicular manslaughter but claimed the car was struck from behind and he was drugged. Modig stated he was asleep during the accident. Calls were made for an independent investigation by Pay\u00e1's daughter and the U.S. Senate. The U.S. Department of State also called for an international investigation into the crash. Several independent Cuban blogs critical of the government have been established, prompting the Cuban government to create its own team of official bloggers to counter them. Blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez gained international attention for her website, Generaci\u00f3n Y, which criticizes the Cuban government. In 2014, S\u00e1nchez launched an independent digital newspaper in Cuba. Despite poor human rights conditions, Cuba has made some advancements in recent years. In 2008, Cuba lifted a ban on Cubans staying in hotels previously restricted to foreign tourists, known as \"tourist apartheid.\" The government has become more open to economic debates and the Catholic Church has been active in broadening social and economic discussions. In 2014, editors of Espacio Laical resigned due to pressure against church involvement in politics but later announced the launch of a new online forum, Cuba Posible. Cuba eliminated the exit permit requirement for travel abroad in January 2013, allowing prominent dissidents and human rights activists to travel freely. In January 2013, Cuba eliminated the exit permit requirement for travel abroad, allowing dissidents and activists to freely travel. Prominent dissident economist Oscar Espinosa Chepe, who was imprisoned in 2003 and released on medical parole in 2004, died in Spain in 2013. The State Department praised him as a champion for economic policy and human rights in Cuba. Cuba remained on the Tier 3 list in the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report. Cuba remained on the Tier 3 list in the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, with the government taking action against sex trafficking for the first time. The economy is state-controlled, with key sectors including tourism, nickel mining, and biotechnology. Remittances from abroad, especially from the United States, have also become significant. Remittances from relatives living abroad, particularly from the United States, are a crucial source of hard currency for Cuba, estimated at $1.4 billion to $2 billion annually. The sugar industry has significantly declined over the past two decades, with production dropping from 8.4 million tons in 1990 to 1.6 million tons in 2014. Cuba heavily relies on Venezuela for its oil needs, receiving about two-thirds of its consumption through a preferential oil agreement. However, setbacks in offshore oil development and economic challenges in Venezuela have prompted Cuba to diversify its trading partners and seek alternative energy sources. Cuba has made strides in health and education, ranking 44th in the UN's Human Development Report. With a high life expectancy of 79.3 years and nearly 100% adult literacy, Cuba's per capita income was in the upper middle range in 2012. Despite economic challenges after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba saw growth with market-oriented reforms, averaging 3.7% annually from 1994 to 2000. Economic growth peaked at 11% and 12% in the 2004-2007 period. Cuba's economy experienced strong growth in the 2004-2007 period, benefiting from tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, as well as support from Venezuela and China. However, it was hit by hurricanes in 2008 and the global financial crisis in 2009, leading to austerity measures and slower growth. Since 2010, growth has improved modestly, with forecasts for 2014 downgraded due to challenges in transitioning to a decentralized economy. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects stronger growth rates averaging 4% in the 2015-2019 period, but notes that withdrawal of support from Venezuela could jeopardize these forecasts. Cuba's economy needs a growth rate of 5% to 7% for development and job creation. The government has implemented economic policy changes, allowing more private sector activities. Self-employment and small businesses have increased, with over 440,000 self-employed individuals. Non-agricultural cooperatives have been established, and state-run restaurants are being converted to cooperatives. Analysts suggest more support for the private sector is necessary. The Cuban government has implemented economic policy changes to support the private sector, including expanding authorized activities and providing state support for credit to small businesses. However, the lack of money in circulation poses a challenge for small business development. Private sector activities catering to tourists and foreign diplomats are more successful than those serving the Cuban market. Questions have been raised about the government's commitment to the private sector due to crackdowns on certain privately run businesses. Ra\u00fal Castro warned against engaging in unauthorized economic activities, emphasizing the need to follow state regulations. The Cuban Communist Party approved economic guidelines in 2011 that include potential economic reforms such as liquidating state enterprises with financial losses and creating special development zones. The Cuban government has implemented economic policy changes to support the private sector, including expanding authorized activities and providing state support for credit to small businesses. Some economic analysts criticized the proposed changes as too limited to address Cuba's economic challenges, such as low wages and the dual-currency system. In October 2013, the government announced plans to end the dual-currency system and move towards monetary unification. The Cuban government announced plans to end the dual-currency system and move towards monetary unification in October 2013. In March 2014, instructions were provided for the removal of the CUC from circulation, referred to as \"day zero.\" Uncertainty surrounds the actual date and exchange rate system post-unification. Reforms under Ra\u00fal Castro have focused on the agricultural sector to boost food production, including giving farmers more control over their land. Despite efforts, overall food production has fallen below targets, with setbacks like Hurricane Sandy affecting the coffee sector in 2012. In November 2013, Cuba introduced a pilot program in Havana, Artemisa, and Mayabeque to end the government's food distribution monopoly and boost production. In March 2014, a new foreign investment law was approved, cutting taxes and offering incentives to attract foreign capital. The law aims to streamline approval processes and improve transparency, but doubts remain about its effectiveness in attracting investments. Cuba has closed joint ventures with foreign companies and arrested executives for corruption, leading investors to seek evidence of government willingness to allow profits. The Cuban government is seeking foreign investment in various sectors like energy, tourism, agriculture, and industry. State-run companies can now keep 50% of their profits, design their own wage systems, and have more flexibility in production and marketing decisions. Economists are pushing for more reforms and competition in the economy, criticizing the government's reliance on central planning. Cuba had extensive support from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, sustaining the economy with annual subsidies. With the end of the Cold War and the loss of Soviet support, Cuba had to open up its economy and develop trade relations with various countries. Venezuela, under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, provided significant support to Cuba with subsidized oil and investment. However, concerns arose after Ch\u00e1vez's death and Venezuela's economic challenges due to declining oil prices. Cuba's main trading partners in terms of exports were Canada, Spain, other European countries, and China. In 2012, Cuba's top trading partners for exports were Venezuela, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, while for imports were Venezuela, China, Spain, Brazil, and the United States. Relations with Russia have improved in recent years, with high-level visits and debt forgiveness. There were reports of Russia reopening a signals intelligence facility in Cuba, but President Putin denied these claims. Trade relations between Russia and Cuba are not significant. Two Russian energy companies have been involved in oil exploration in Cuba, with Gazprom and Zarubezhneft conducting drilling operations. Despite some unsuccessful attempts, agreements were signed with Cuba's state oil company for offshore exploration. Relations with China have also strengthened in recent years. Relations with China have grown closer in recent years, with Chinese trade and investment in Cuba increasing. Chinese President Hu Jintao and Vice President Xi Jinping visited Cuba multiple times, signing cooperation agreements focusing on trade and investment. The European Union and Cuba have made significant progress in talks for a framework agreement covering political, trade, and development issues. In 1996, the EU adopted a Common Position on Cuba, emphasizing the transition to democracy and human rights. All Latin American nations now have diplomatic relations with Cuba. Cuba has strengthened ties with Venezuela and is a member of ALBA. Cuba deployed doctors to Brazil, earning $225 million annually. Brazil has invested in the development of the port of Mariel. Cuba became a full member of the Rio Group in 2008. Cuba became a member of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in 2011, hosting the second summit in 2014. The summit addressed human rights issues and emphasized nonintervention in political systems. Cuba's exclusion from the Summit of the Americas was a contentious issue, with the US and Canada opposing its participation. However, in 2014, Panama announced that Cuba would be invited to the next summit. This decision was influenced by several Latin American nations threatening to boycott the summit unless Cuba was included. President Obama's new policy approach towards Cuba in 2014 paved the way for Cuba's participation in the summit, with a focus on human rights and democracy. Cuba's exclusion from the OAS in 1962 due to its Marxist-Leninist ideology was overturned in 2009, potentially leading to its reentry. In 2009, the OAS overturned the 1962 resolution, potentially allowing Cuba to rejoin the organization. Despite welcoming the decision, Cuba stated it would not return to the OAS. Cuba is active in international forums like the UN and has received support from organizations like UNDP and UNESCO. The UN has provided aid to Cuba, including after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Cuba is active in international organizations such as the World Trade Organization but is not a member of the IMF, World Bank, or Inter-American Development Bank. In 2013, a North Korean freighter with suspected illicit narcotics was detained in Panama after making stops in Cuba. Weapons were found hidden aboard the ship along with sugar, leading to a public broadcast by Panama's then-President Ricardo Martinelli. Cuba acknowledged a ship loaded with sugar and \"obsolete defensive weapons\" found in Panama. The weapons included anti-aircraft missiles and parts, with speculation that North Korea may have been involved in upgrading them. The shipment from Cuba to North Korea included missiles and MiG-21 jets, raising skepticism about whether the items were intended for repair or for North Korea's own use in military defenses. Additionally, the shipment also included small arms, light weapons, artillery ammunition, generators, batteries, and night vision equipment. The discovery of the Chong Chon Gang shipment of weapons from Cuba to North Korea raises questions about the nature of Cuban-North Korean relations. North Korean ships have made multiple trips to Cuba since 2009, with some vessels visiting the same ports as the Chong Chon Gang. Relations between the two countries have not been considered significant historically. North Korea provided 100,000 Kalashnikov assault weapons to Cuba in the 1980s. A high-level North Korean military delegation visited Cuba in July 2013, meeting with Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro to discuss boosting cooperative relations. Panama requested a U.N. investigation into the weapons shipment, leading to a visit by the U.N. Panel of Experts for North Korea in August 2013. In response, the U.N. Panel of Experts for North Korea visited Panama in August 2013 and concluded that the Cuban weapons found on the Chong Chon Gang violated U.N. sanctions. The panel's report in March 2014 stated that the shipment and transaction between Cuba and North Korea were sanctions violations, involving surface-to-air missile systems, MiG-21 aircraft, and other arms-related material. The extensive efforts to conceal the cargo and contingency instructions onboard the vessel indicated a clear intention to circumvent resolutions. On July 28, 2014, the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on the operator of the Chong Chon Gang, Ocean Maritime Management Company, Ltd, for arranging the concealed arms shipment. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power condemned the incident as an illegal attempt to circumvent sanctions. U.S.-Cuban relations have been tense, with events like the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis highlighting the hostility between the two countries. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved supporting guerrilla insurgencies, imposing economic sanctions, and maintaining an embargo on trade and financial transactions. Key events include the Mariel boatlift in 1980, the 1994 exodus of Cuban refugees, and the 1996 shootdown of U.S. civilian planes by Cuban fighter jets. President Kennedy initiated the embargo in 1962 under the Foreign Assistance Act, prohibiting all trade between the two countries. The United States imposed an embargo on Cuba in the early 1960s, initially under the Trading with the Enemy Act and later expanded with the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. These regulations prohibit most financial and trade transactions with Cuba, requiring licenses for exports and strengthening sanctions with acts like the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, prohibits U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry into the U.S. for vessels involved in Cuban trade. This law codified the Cuban embargo and limits the executive branch's ability to lift it without congressional approval. The Cuban embargo, known as the Helms/Burton legislation, imposes restrictions on U.S. subsidiaries trading with Cuba and limits entry into the U.S. for vessels involved in Cuban trade. The law includes provisions for holding those trafficking in U.S. property confiscated by Cuba liable for damages in U.S. federal court. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama have suspended the implementation of certain provisions. Additionally, U.S. policy includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and broadcasting to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for agricultural exports to Cuba with financing restrictions, making the U.S. one of Cuba's largest suppliers of agricultural products. The Clinton Administration made changes to U.S. policy after Pope John Paul II's 1998 visit to Cuba to support the Cuban people. This included resuming direct flights, cash remittances, and streamlining procedures for medical supplies. President Clinton announced further measures in 1999, broadening cash remittances, expanding passenger charter flights, and loosening travel restrictions to Cuba. The George W. Bush Administration tightened restrictions on travel to Cuba for certain categories of travelers, emphasizing stronger enforcement of economic sanctions and limiting remittances and humanitarian aid parcels. They established a Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba to support the Cuban people in bringing an end to the dictatorship. In June 2004, tightened restrictions were issued, followed by further restrictions on payment terms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba in February 2005. Recommendations for political change in Cuba were made in a report in July 2006, leading to increased U.S. funding for democracy and human rights efforts. The Bush Administration maintained a sanctions-based approach towards Cuba, urging peaceful, democratic change in the country. President Bush emphasized the need for Cuba to release political prisoners, respect human rights, and pave the way for free and fair elections in March 2008. During the Obama Administration, there was a dual-track policy approach towards Cuba, maintaining economic sanctions while also reaching out to the Cuban people through easing restrictions on travel and remittances. Efforts to improve relations were hindered by Cuba's imprisonment of USAID subcontractor Alan Gross in 2009. However, in December 2014, Cuba released Gross on humanitarian grounds. On December 17, 2014, Cuba released Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds and announced major changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba, including a restoration of diplomatic relations and new efforts towards engagement. The Obama Administration had previously lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances in April 2009, and further eased travel restrictions and allowed remittances to non-family members in January 2011. These measures aimed to increase purposeful travel to Cuba for religious, educational, and journalistic activities, as well as facilitate remittances for religious institutions. The Obama Administration prioritized empowering Cubans to determine their own future by building connections between Cuban and American people. This included policies on travel, remittances, and people-to-people interactions to support Cubans in accessing information, self-employment opportunities, and civil society strengthening. The Administration initiated engagement with the Cuban government in 2009 to improve relations, with President Obama seeking a new beginning with Cuba at the 2009 Summit of the Americas. The President sought a new beginning with Cuba, acknowledging the need to overcome mistrust. He expressed readiness to engage with the Cuban government on various issues, including human rights and democratic reform. Despite some progress in relations, tensions arose in 2009 with the arrest of an American subcontractor. A subcontractor working on Cuba democracy projects funded by USAID was arrested in Havana for providing Internet equipment to Cuba's Jewish community. Despite efforts for his release, the case hindered relations between the US and Cuba. In mid-2013, there was renewed engagement with Cuba on various fronts, including talks for direct mail service. Previous talks in 2009 did not lead to a resumption of direct mail service. The State Department characterized the September talks as \"fruitful.\" The September talks between the United States and Cuba were described as \"fruitful\" with the goal of establishing a pilot program for direct mail transportation. The Obama Administration resumed migration talks in 2013, with positive statements issued after each round. Cooperation on air and maritime search and rescue procedures was emphasized during the talks, with agreements reached on enforcement measures to save lives. In November 2013, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry discussed U.S. policy towards Cuba, emphasizing the need for updated policies. They acknowledged some cooperation between the U.S. and Cuba on common interests, while also recognizing the authoritarian reality of life for ordinary Cubans. Kerry welcomed changes in Cuba allowing more freedom for Cubans to travel and work for themselves. President Obama expressed concern about human rights violations in Cuba, highlighting the lack of freedom for ordinary Cubans to criticize their leaders. The handshake between President Obama and President Castro in 2013 sparked debate on thawing relations, with critics condemning the poor human rights record of the Cuban government. Human rights violations, including the deaths of hunger strikers, remained a key concern under the Obama Administration. In 2010 and 2012, hunger strikers died in Cuba, raising concerns about human rights violations. Despite the release of political prisoners, the US maintained criticism of Cuba's poor human rights record. US officials met with Cuban dissidents, expressing worries about the suppression of peaceful activities by civil society groups. The State Department continued to condemn Cuba's harsh tactics against civil society in 2013. In 2014, the State Department expressed deep concern about the human rights situation in Cuba, condemning arbitrary detentions, physical violence, and abusive actions by the Cuban government against advocates. They also criticized the detention of civil society members, activists, and the Ladies in White, as well as the violent assault of an independent journalist. The release of Alan Gross from prison in Cuba was a top U.S. priority, with efforts made through various channels including the Vatican. President Obama announced major developments in U.S.-Cuban relations on December 17, 2014. The Cuban government released USAID subcontractor Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds after five years of imprisonment, which was seen as an impediment to better relations. Additionally, the Cuban government released a U.S. intelligence asset in exchange for three Cuban intelligence agents who had been imprisoned in the United States since 1998. President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards normalization of relations by reestablishing diplomatic relations, reviewing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and increasing travel, commerce, and information flow. The White House fact sheet outlined policy changes to implement the third step towards normalization of relations with Cuba, including expanding travel, increasing remittances, allowing commercial sales/exports of certain goods, permitting imports of goods from Cuba, and facilitating financial transactions. The White House fact sheet outlined policy changes to implement the third step towards normalization of relations with Cuba, including expanding travel, increasing remittances, allowing commercial sales/exports of certain goods, permitting imports of goods from Cuba, and facilitating financial transactions. These actions will require changes to U.S. embargo regulations administered by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Commerce. The White House announced policy changes to further normalize relations with Cuba, including expanding travel, increasing remittances, allowing commercial sales/exports of certain goods, permitting imports from Cuba, and facilitating financial transactions. While the President cannot lift the embargo due to legislation, he plans to engage Congress in a debate about it. The embargo is tied to conditions in Cuba, such as the presence of a democratically elected government. The White House announced policy changes to normalize relations with Cuba, including expanding travel and increasing remittances. The President plans to engage Congress in a debate about amending or repealing laws that impede economic relations with Cuba. Cuba's participation in the Summit of the Americas in 2015 was a challenge for the Administration, with human rights and democracy being key themes. Several Latin American nations had vowed not to participate if Cuba was not invited. There are different approaches to achieving democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba, including maintaining pressure on the government, engaging in constructive dialogue, and normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Efforts in Congress have been made to ease sanctions on Cuba, with some measures being approved but later stripped due to presidential veto threats. In 2009, Congress took action to ease travel restrictions to Cuba, marking a significant change in U.S.-Cuba relations. Since the approval of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, there have been calls to reexamine U.S. policy towards Cuba following Fidel Castro's departure. Two policy approaches have been suggested: maintaining isolation while supporting the Cuban people, or increasing engagement to influence attitudes. Advocates for easing sanctions argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to peaceful reform in Cuba and prevent violent change or mass exodus to the U.S. The United States should adopt a more pragmatic approach towards Cuba, despite the absence of Fidel Castro. Supporters of policy change highlight international backing to lift the embargo, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering of the Cuban people. Proponents argue for consistency in dealing with remaining communist governments like China and Vietnam. On the contrary, opponents advocate for isolating Cuba while supporting its people as the best strategy for political change. They emphasize the conditions outlined in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 for normalizing relations and caution against softening policy without concrete reforms, which could strengthen the Castro government and prolong the communist regime. Opponents of softening U.S. policy towards Cuba argue for maintaining commitment to democracy and human rights, stating that sustained sanctions can be effective. They believe that Cuba's economic policies, not the U.S. embargo, are responsible for the country's hardships. Public opinion polls show majority support for normalizing relations with Cuba, with some division among Cuban Americans in Florida. A 2014 poll by the Atlantic Council found that 56% of respondents nationwide and 63% in Florida supported engaging more directly with Cuba. FIU polls in Miami-Dade County also showed a slight majority of Cuban Americans opposing the embargo. The FIU poll revealed that 51% of registered voters supported lifting travel restrictions to Cuba. Some Members of Congress praised Obama's new Cuba policy, while others criticized him for not securing concessions on human rights. U.S.-Cuban relations will be debated in Congress, which has historically influenced policy on travel, remittances, agricultural exports, and democracy projects in Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue for over 50 years, with changes in enforcement under different administrations. The restrictions are part of the overall embargo regulations administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The George W. Bush Administration increased enforcement of travel restrictions and tightened restrictions on travel and private remittances to Cuba. In 2003, travel for people-to-people educational exchanges was eliminated, and in 2004, further restrictions were imposed. Under the Obama Administration, restrictions on travel to Cuba were eased, including family travel and provision of humanitarian assistance. Changes in legislation in 2009 allowed for increased purposeful travel related to religious, educational, and journalistic activities, as well as easier remittances to non-family members in Cuba. The Obama Administration eased travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing for increased purposeful travel related to religious, educational, and journalistic activities, easier remittances to non-family members, and licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. The new measures were similar to Clinton Administration policies in 1999 but were curtailed by the Bush Administration in 2003 and 2004. People-to-people trips began in August 2011, with tightened restrictions in May 2012 requiring organizations to describe how travel would enhance contact with the Cuban people. The revised guidelines for people-to-people travel to Cuba require specifying how meetings with prohibited Cuban government officials would advance the purposeful travel by enhancing contact with the Cuban people, supporting civil society, or promoting independence from Cuban authorities. In 2012, there were reports of delays in license approvals for such travel programs, leading to trip cancellations and layoffs. In 2013, Members of Congress criticized Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z for their Cuba trip, raising concerns about potential tourism violations of U.S. law. The Treasury Department confirmed that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's trip to Cuba was authorized as a people-to-people exchange, with no apparent violations of U.S. sanctions. Members of Congress had criticized the singers for not meeting with oppressed individuals in Cuba, but the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General agreed that the trip did not violate sanctions. In 2013, House Democrats praised President Obama for easing travel restrictions to Cuba and called for further expansion of permissible travel categories. President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba on December 17, 2014, including general licenses for 12 categories of travel and an increase in remittance amounts. Arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include rights of Americans to travel, influencing conditions in Cuba, and the ability to travel to other communist countries. The legislative activity in the first session of the 113th Congress regarding the Cuba travel ban included different provisions in the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 Financial Services and General Government appropriations measure. However, none of these provisions were included in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure signed into law on January 17, 2014. The House version would have prohibited funding for people-to-people travel to Cuba. The House version of the FY2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act included provisions to restrict funding for people-to-people travel to Cuba. The Senate version aimed to expand the general license for professional research and meetings in Cuba for specific purposes related to disaster prevention and natural resource protection. The Secretary of Homeland Security provided information on travelers visiting relatives in Cuba since FY2007, including trip duration, spending per traveler, return trips, and total spending. Congress did not pass H.R. 5016, which included provisions on Cuba. Several bills in the 113th Congress aimed to lift travel restrictions to Cuba. U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed with restrictions for over a decade. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, with transactions conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. Cuba has purchased about $5 billion in products from the United States since 2001, mainly agricultural products. U.S. exports to Cuba increased significantly from 2001 to 2008 due to rising food prices and Cuba's increased food needs after natural disasters. The United States was the largest supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba from 2002 to 2010. In 2011, Brazil was Cuba's top agricultural supplier, but the United States regained this position in 2012. U.S. exports to Cuba saw fluctuations, with a notable increase in 2012 to $464 million due to Hurricane Sandy's impact on Cuba's agricultural sector. However, exports declined in 2013 and the first nine months of 2014. Leading products in U.S. exports to Cuba include poultry, soybean oilcake, corn, and soybeans. Analysts attribute the overall decline in exports to factors like Cuba's shortage of hard currency and other countries offering better credit terms. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) study in 2007 analyzed the effects of U.S. government financing and travel restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba. If restrictions were lifted, U.S. exports of agricultural products to Cuba, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, milk powder, processed foods, wheat, and dry beans, would increase significantly. The USITC study in 2009 updated the 2007 analysis on U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba, predicting a significant increase in exports if restrictions on financing and travel were lifted. U.S. agribusiness companies support easing restrictions to capitalize on the market, while opponents argue that current policy allows for substantial sales to Cuba since 2001. Since 2001, there have been substantial sales to Cuba. President Obama announced changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba in 2014, allowing for expanded commercial sales and exports to support Cuba's private sector. Legislative efforts have also been made to ease restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba. Regulations implementing these changes are expected to be issued soon. In response to objections from U.S. agricultural exporters and Congress, legislative provisions were enacted in FY2010 and FY2011 to redefine \"payment of cash in advance\" for exports to Cuba. This allowed payment to occur before goods were offloaded in Cuba, rather than before leaving a U.S. port. However, no similar provision was included in FY2012 legislation. The Senate bill in the 113th Congress included provisions related to Cuba, such as allowing direct transfers from Cuban financial institutions to U.S. financial institutions for licensed exports. Several bills were introduced to lift the embargo on Cuba and ease restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports to the country. Additionally, a draft report in July 2014 proposed directing the Treasury Department to coordinate with other departments for conducting certain activities related to Cuba. The Treasury Department is reviewing the impact of the prohibition on U.S. private financing for sales of agricultural commodities on small exporters and farmers. A trademark sanction related to Cuba has been in place for 15 years, preventing the U.S. from accepting payment for trademark registrations from Cuban nationals without the original owner's consent. This measure was enacted due to a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. over the Havana Club rum trademark. Pernod Ricard holds the rights to the Havana Club name through an agreement with the Arechabala family. The European Union challenged the U.S. law prohibiting the trademark, leading to a WTO ruling in 2002. The U.S. agreed to comply by January 3, 2003, but the deadline was extended multiple times. In 2005, the EU-U.S. bilateral agreement stated that the EU would not request authorization for trademark registration. In an EU-U.S. bilateral agreement, the EU reserved the right to retaliate in the future, while the United States agreed not to block a future EU request. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cancelled Cuba's Havana Club trademark registration in 2006, leading to legal battles over the origin of Havana Club rum in the United States. Pernod Ricard sued Bacardi over misleading rum origin labeling. US courts ruled in Bacardi's favor. Congress debates amending or repealing Section 211 regarding trademarks confiscated by Cuba. House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the issue. Several legislative initiatives were introduced during the 112th Congress to bring Section 211 into compliance with the WTO ruling, but no action was taken. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to either apply a narrow fix or repeal the trademark sanction. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 reduced pressure on Congress to comply with the WTO ruling. Since 1996, the U.S. has provided assistance to increase the flow of information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba. The US has provided funding for Cuba democracy efforts through USAID and the State Department, totaling $264 million from FY1996 to FY2014. The State Department has received slightly more funding in recent years and has transferred some assistance to NED. Congress allocated $20 million for FY2014, with $7.5 million directly to NED and up to $10 million administered by the State Department. No new programs or activities in Cuba can be funded by USAID under the Act. USAID's Cuba program has supported U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy, civil society, and human rights in Cuba. Current program partners include Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, Grupo de Apoyo a la Democracia, International Relief and Development, International Republican Institute, National Democratic Institute, New America Foundation, and Pan-American Development Foundation. The Administration requested $20 million in FY2012 for promoting democratic principles, which was supported by Congress. The FY2012 budget request aimed to enhance transparency, focus on Cuba, and expand support for civic groups. U.S. assistance would strengthen various elements of Cuban civil society, including marginalized groups, youth, legal associations, and women's networks. Programs would aim to increase community involvement, networking, document human rights violations, provide humanitarian aid to political prisoners, and build leadership skills. Additionally, support would be provided for disseminating information on market economies and economic rights. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2012 Department of State budget would have allocated $15 million for these efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2012 Department of State budget allocated $15 million in ESF for Cuba, including humanitarian and democracy assistance, economic reform, private sector initiatives, and human rights. The committee emphasized transparency in fund allocation and program implementation, with regular updates required from the USAID Administrator. In contrast, a draft House Appropriations Committee bill recommended $20 million for democracy-building in Cuba, excluding funds for business promotion, economic reform, and social development. The Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 allocated $20 million for Cuba projects in FY2012. USAID will administer $9.45 million, State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor will administer $9.85 million, and Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs will administer $0.7 million. Funding will support human rights initiatives, civil society and media programs, and program support. For FY2013, the Administration requested $15 million for human rights and democracy programs in Cuba. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act would have provided $15 million in ESF for Cuba, including support for humanitarian assistance, economic reform, private sector initiatives, democracy, and human rights. The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the bill would have provided $20 million in ESF, transferring and merging the aid with funds available to the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy and strengthen civil society in Cuba. Congress did not complete action on FY2013 appropriations before the deadline. In FY2013, Congress approved a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 117, P.L. 112-175) to continue funding through March 27, 2013, with an across-the-board increase of 0.612%. Full-year FY2013 appropriations were completed with the approval of H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6), which included $19.283 million for Cuba democracy programs. The State Department will administer $17.783 million of the appropriated funds. The State Department will administer $17.783 million for Cuba democracy programs in FY2013. In FY2014, $15 million was requested for human rights and democracy projects in Cuba to support civil society programs, promote democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression, provide humanitarian assistance, and promote uncensored information flow within Cuba. In FY2014, Congress considered bills that allocated $20 million in ESF assistance for Cuba to promote democracy and civil society. Ultimately, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, allocated up to $17.5 million for programs in Cuba, with restrictions on how the funds could be used. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated up to $17.5 million for programs in Cuba, with restrictions on how the funds could be used. For FY2014, the Administration provided an estimated $20 million in ESF for Cuba democracy programs, $5 million more than requested. In FY2015, the Administration requested $20 million for Cuba democracy programs to support civil society initiatives promoting democracy and human rights. The request for the FY2015 Department of State Appropriations bill aimed to strengthen civil society in Cuba by working with independent elements, facilitating information sharing, and supporting Cuban-led efforts to document human rights violations. The bill allocated $20 million for these purposes, with restrictions on business promotion and economic reform. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the measure, S. 2499 ( S.Rept. 113-195 ), would have provided up to $10 million in ESF for programs in Cuba and an additional $5 million for USAID programs to support the development of private businesses in Cuba. Congress completed action on FY2015 appropriations with a FY2015 omnibus appropriations measure ( P.L. 113-235 ) in December 2015, stating that ESF assistance should be made available for Cuba. NED's Cuba program is funded by regular appropriations from Congress and the State Department. For FY2014, Congress allocated at least $7.5 million for democracy assistance in Cuba to NED, which is double the amount spent in FY2013. NED's funding for Cuba projects in recent years has varied, with $3.4 million provided in FY2013 for various organizations and initiatives. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued reports since 2006 on USAID and State Department democracy programs for Cuba, highlighting significant problems with management and oversight. The programs have faced issues with internal controls, high shipping costs, and lax oversight, diminishing their effectiveness. The GAO issued a report in 2008 praising USAID's efforts to improve oversight of its Cuba democracy program by implementing competitive grants, hiring more staff, and enhancing financial services. However, the report also highlighted the need for USAID to increase staffing levels for effective grant oversight and to assess overall efforts to reduce grantee risks. In January 2013, GAO reported improvements in USAID's financial monitoring of Cuba democracy program funds, but found gaps in the State Department's monitoring. Recommendations were made to strengthen monitoring by using a risk-based approach and obtaining more information on implementing partners. In April 2014, an Associated Press report alleged USAID's involvement in a covert \"Cuban Twitter\" project to undermine Cuba's government. According to a press report, USAID was involved in a project called ZunZuneo, which lasted over two years and was used by thousands of Cubans. USAID maintained that the program was not covert but had a discreet profile to minimize risks. Some Members of Congress criticized USAID for lack of transparency, while others defended the agency. In another report, a USAID contractor sent youth from Latin American countries to Cuba for civic programs with the alleged goal of identifying potential social-change actors. USAID was involved in recruiting young Cubans for anti-government activism under the guise of civic programs. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor, was imprisoned in Cuba for his work on a democracy project. Despite calls for his release, he remained in prison, hindering U.S.-Cuban relations. Cuba linked Gross's release to the \"Cuban five\" espionage case, but the U.S. rejected the linkage. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor, was arrested in Cuba for installing internet connections for Jewish communities. He was charged with \"actions against the independence and territorial integrity of the state\" and sentenced to 15 years in prison after a two-day trial. The United States rejected linking his release to the \"Cuban five\" espionage case. In 2011, Alan Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Cuba. Despite appeals for his release due to health concerns and family issues, including his mother's lung cancer diagnosis and daughter's cancer treatment, his appeal was rejected. Concerns about his health, weight loss, and potential cancer diagnosis were raised by his wife in 2012. In November 2012, Alan Gross and his wife filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government and his employer, DAI, alleging failure to disclose risks. A settlement was reached with DAI in May 2013, but the lawsuit against the U.S. government was dismissed. USAID agreed to pay $3.2 million to DAI in December 2014. During Gross's imprisonment, U.S. officials and Congress members advocated for his release. Judy Gross urged President Obama to intervene in late November 2012. In late November 2012, Judy Gross urged President Obama to prioritize her husband's release and designate a special envoy to meet with the Cuban government. On December 3, 2012, the State Department called for Alan Gross's release and asked Cuba to allow him to visit his ill mother in the U.S. The Senate approved a resolution on December 5, 2012, demanding Gross's immediate release and access to medical treatment. The State Department continued to prioritize securing Gross's release during his incarceration. The U.S. prioritized securing Alan Gross's release, using diplomatic channels and seeking assistance from the Vatican and Uruguayan President. President Obama also raised the issue with Ra\u00fal Castro. Gross's detention hindered relations between Cuba and the U.S. His incarceration was discussed at migration talks, and he went on a hunger strike in April 2014. In early April 2014, Alan Gross went on a hunger strike protesting his treatment by the Cuban and U.S. governments. His lawyer stated that Gross planned to return to his family within the year, expressing concerns about his health issues during imprisonment. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez expressed interest in resolving the issue with the U.S. without preconditions. The release of U.S. prisoner of war Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl held captive by the Taliban since 2009 led to calls for similar efforts to secure the release of Alan Gross. Gross was ultimately released by Cuba on humanitarian grounds in December 2014. U.S.-government sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba\u2014Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2014began in 1985 and 1990 respectively, providing news and information to the people of Cuba through various media platforms. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) manages Radio and TV Marti, headquartered in Miami, FL. Legislation required OCB's relocation to South Florida in the 104th Congress. TV Marti programming has utilized various transmission methods over the years to reach audiences in Cuba. TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts via Internet and satellite TV 24/7. Transmission methods have evolved over the years, including aerostat and airborne platforms. AeroMart\u00ed was introduced in 2006 for live broadcasts but was eliminated in FY2014 due to cost effectiveness concerns. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) uses various web domains and anti-censorship tools to reach Internet users in Cuba, including SMS messaging to push information to mobile phone users. Funding for broadcasting to Cuba has ranged from $27.977 million in FY2012 to an estimated $27.043 million in FY2014, with additional funding potentially transferred from Economic Support Funds. In FY2012, Congress approved $28.475 million for Cuba broadcasting, meeting the Administration's request. For FY2013, the Administration requested $23.594 million, a decrease from the previous year. The BBG proposed eliminating the AeroMart\u00ed platform for a savings of $2 million due to cost effectiveness decreases. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act would have provided $23.4 million, $194,000 less than the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill would have provided $28.062 million, $4.468 million more than the Administration's request. Congress did not complete action on FY2013 appropriations before the end of the fiscal year. In September 2012, Congress approved a continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) to fund projects through March 27, 2013, with a 0.612% increase. Funding reductions due to sequestration were not stopped by the approval of H.R. 933 (P.L. 113-6) in March 2013. The BBG requested $23.804 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2014, a decrease from FY2013. Actual spending for OCB in FY2013 was $26.293 million. The BBG proposed program reductions for Cuba broadcasting in FY2014, including eliminating AeroMart\u00ed due to cost effectiveness and Cuban government jamming. They also planned to cut shortwave frequencies at night, eliminate positions, reduce contractors, and seek inter-agency agreements for funding. The House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee had different funding amounts for Cuba broadcasting in FY2014. Ultimately, Congress appropriated $27.043 million, which was above the Administration's request. In FY2015, the Administration requested $23.130 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), anticipating a possible $5 million transfer from the ESF foreign aid spending account for Cuba democracy programs. The FY2015 Department of State appropriations allocated $27.130 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), with funds potentially transferred from ESF to restore program reductions. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) received $27.130 million in FY2015 appropriations, with funds possibly transferred from ESF to offset program cuts. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies and funding cuts due to low audience numbers, with GAO reports indicating less than 2% of respondents tuning in to Radio or TV Mart\u00ed. The GAO report highlighted concerns with TV Mart\u00ed's viewership, adherence to broadcast standards, and interference with Cuban broadcasts. Recommendations included moving the Office of Cuba Broadcasting back to Washington and integrating it fully into the Voice of America. The GAO report examined the BBG's strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba, including audience sizes, transmission costs, obstacles, and cost effectiveness. It also analyzed program efficiencies and shared resources between Radio and TV Mart\u00ed and the Voice of America. The GAO report found that the BBG's strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba lacked key information, addressing only partially the requirements set forth in the conference report. A controversy arose in May 2012 when OCB Director criticized Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega, leading to calls for the Administration to reject the comments. This raised questions about OCB's editorial policy and adherence to broadcast standards. Cuba was added to the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism in 1982 due to alleged ties to terrorism. Countries on this list face restrictions on trade benefits and foreign aid. Validated licenses are required for exports to these countries under the Export Administration Act. Cuba was added to the State Department's list of states sponsoring international terrorism in 1982. In 1992, Fidel Castro announced an end to Cuba's support for insurgents abroad due to the breakup of the Soviet Union. Critics argue that Cuba's presence on the terrorism list is a Cold War relic, while supporters point to evidence of Cuba's support for terrorism. In 2013, the State Department reported that Cuba provided safe haven to members of ETA and FARC, but their ties to ETA have become more distant. Cuba supported peace negotiations between FARC and the Colombian government. The report stated that Cuba did not provide weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups. Cuba also harbored U.S. fugitives, providing housing, food ration books, and medical care. Several U.S. fugitives from justice, including convicted murderers and hijackers, sought refuge in Cuba in the 1970s and 1980s. Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of killing a New Jersey State Police officer in 1973 and escaped to Cuba in 1984. In recent years, fugitives wanted for Medicare and insurance fraud have also fled to Cuba. William Potts, who hijacked a plane to Havana in 1984, returned to the U.S. in 2013 to face charges after serving time in a Cuban jail. Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the United States on a case by case basis, but generally refuses to render fugitives judged as \"political.\" They have requested the return of Cuban criminals in exchange for extraditing fugitives to the U.S. This includes the case of convicted felon William Morales and other fugitives seeking safe harbor in Cuba to escape prosecution in the U.S. Cuba's commitment to combating money laundering and terrorism was highlighted in the 2012 terrorism report. The country became a member of GAFISUD in 2012 and is set to undergo a mutual evaluation in 2014. The EAA outlines two ways for a country to be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list. The EAA outlines two ways for a country to be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list, including submitting a report to Congress justifying the rescission and certifying no support for terrorism. Other provisions of law also authorize the designation of a foreign government as a state sponsor of terrorism. The bill H.R. 1917 aimed to rescind Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. President Obama instructed a review of Cuba's designation, stating that a nation renouncing terrorism should not face sanctions. Cuba and the United States reached migration accords in 1994 and 1995 to prevent mass exodus of Cubans. In 1994 and 1995, the United States and Cuba reached migration agreements to prevent a mass exodus of Cubans fleeing to the United States by boat. President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy in August 1994, announcing that Cubans rescued at sea would be taken to Guantanamo Bay. Talks between Cuba and the United States led to a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994, to facilitate safe and orderly Cuban migration to the United States. In 1995, the United States and Cuba reached an agreement where the U.S. would parole over 30,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo into the U.S. but intercept future Cuban migrants at sea and return them to Cuba. The U.S. Coast Guard has since interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to Cuba, while those who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy allows Cubans who reach shore in the United States to stay, while those interdicted at sea are returned to Cuba. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard fluctuated over the years, with reasons for decline including economic downturn and more efficient patrolling. However, from FY2011 to FY2014, the number of interdictions increased annually, possibly due to Cuba's poor economic and political situation. The increase in migrant interdictions from FY2011 to FY2014 was attributed to various factors such as Cuba's economic and political situation, improved communication between the U.S. Coast Guard and Cuban Border Guard, and easier payment of fees to migrant smugglers. Despite the U.S. Coast Guard's efforts, unauthorized Cubans still manage to reach the United States, with many preferring land-based entry at U.S. ports of entry, especially from Mexico. Cubans prefer land-based entry at U.S. ports of entry, particularly from Mexico, despite a migration accord between Mexico and Cuba in 2008. The number of Cubans entering the U.S. via the southwest border has been increasing, with over 13,500 as of July 2014. U.S.-Cuban talks on migration issues were restarted by the Obama Administration in 2009, with four rounds of talks held until January 2011. Another round of migration talks took place in July 2013 in Washington, DC. The State Department issued a statement after the July 17, 2013, talks in Washington, DC, emphasizing U.S. priorities on Cuba migration issues, cooperation in aviation safety and visa processing, and the need to ensure the goals of the accord are met. The Cuban delegation discussed joint actions to deter illegal migration and ratified protocols against smuggling and trafficking. They criticized U.S. policies like the \"wet foot/dry foot policy\" and the Cuban Adjustment Act for encouraging illegal immigration. Since the talks in 2013, two more rounds of migration discussions were held in 2014. The State Department and Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs addressed issues like aviation security, consular document fraud, and visa processing. Cuba expressed concerns about its consular services in the U.S. due to banking interruptions. Both governments agreed to enforce search and rescue operation procedures to save lives. Cuba had suspended consular services in the U.S. twice since 2013 due to banking issues. The State Department has been working with Cuba to resolve banking issues affecting consular services. Cuba suspended services twice since 2013 due to banking problems. In October 2012, Cuba updated its migration policy, eliminating the need for exit permits for travel abroad. The Cuban government announced a new travel policy in January 2013, which allowed health care professionals, including doctors, to travel abroad without exit permits. The policy went into effect on January 14, 2013, leading to long lines at migration offices. The U.S. State Department welcomed the change, stating that it aligns with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Notable dissidents and activists, such as Yoani S\u00e1nchez, took advantage of the new policy to travel abroad. Some activists have traveled abroad due to Cuba's new migration policy. The State Department changed non-immigrant B-2 visas for Cubans to be valid for five years with multiple entries. This aims to strengthen people-to-people ties and reduce burdens on Cuban travelers. Cuba's geographic location makes it vulnerable to narcotics smuggling, although it is not a major producer or consumer of illicit drugs. Cuba faces challenges with drug smuggling through its waters and airspace, leading to concerns from Cuban officials. The government has implemented measures to combat the issue, including stricter penalties for traffickers and cooperation with other countries on anti-drug efforts. Cuba has numerous anti-drug agreements in place and has focused on maritime and air interdiction through Operation Hatchet. In 2012, Cuba reported intercepting 3.05 metric tons of illegal narcotics, primarily from wash-ups on Cuban shores. Cuba has been actively combating drug smuggling since 2003, with a focus on internal enforcement and cooperation with the United States. In 1996, Cuban authorities seized 6.6 tons of cocaine from a ship bound for Miami, leading to increased cooperation between the two countries. This cooperation has continued to improve, with the stationing of a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana in 2000. According to the 2014 INCSR, the Coast Guard now shares information with Cuban authorities. The United States and Cuba have increased coordination in combating drug trafficking, with the Coast Guard sharing tactical information and responding to Cuban reports of suspected smuggling vessels. Law enforcement communication improved in 2013, with a professional exchange on maritime drug interdiction. Cuba has expressed willingness to cooperate and proposed a bilateral anti-drug cooperation agreement, which is still under review by the U.S. State Department. Such an accord could enhance counternarcotics efforts for both countries. The United States and Cuba have increased coordination in combating drug trafficking, with the Coast Guard sharing tactical information and responding to Cuban reports of suspected smuggling vessels. Greater cooperation in real-time information-sharing and improved tactics could lead to increased interdictions and disruptions of illegal trafficking. Senator Feinstein recommended expanding U.S. collaboration with Cuba on counternarcotics, emphasizing the importance of increasing cooperation between the two countries. The collaboration between the United States and Cuba on counternarcotics includes expanding Coast Guard presence in Havana, establishing ship-to-ship communication protocols, negotiating a bilateral agreement, and allowing Cuba to participate in the U.S.-Caribbean Security Dialogue. Cuba faced setbacks in offshore oil development in 2012, but potential reserves in the North Cuba Basin could reduce its dependence on Venezuelan oil. In 2012, Cuba produced about 51,000 barrels of oil per day onshore and consumed 171,000 barrels per day. Repsol's offshore drilling in Cuba came up dry, leading to their departure in 2013. Other companies like Petronas and Gazprom also explored for oil but found it not commercially viable. Venezuela provides Cuba with 100,000 barrels of oil per day. In 2012, Venezuela's PdVSA and Brazil's Petrobras explored for oil off the coast of western Cuba, but both projects were deemed not commercially viable. Other foreign companies like PetroVietnam, Sonangol, and ONGC also had exploration agreements. Russian energy companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft signed an agreement with Cuba's state oil company in 2014. The Scarabeo-9 oil rig left Cuba in November 2012 after three unsuccessful wells. This setback delayed Cuba's efforts to develop its deepwater offshore hydrocarbon resources, with experts predicting a long wait before companies return to drill in Cuba's offshore deepwaters. Some observers are skeptical about the prospects for the joint offshore project between Russian energy companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft in Cuba. In 2013, technical problems with the Songa Mercur oil rig led to its departure, delaying the completion of the exploratory well. Concerns were raised about Cuba's development of deepwater petroleum reserves near the US after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Relations between Cuba and the US further complicate addressing oil spill risks. The poor state of relations between Cuba and the United States could complicate addressing oil spill risks in the waters northwest of Cuba. If an oil spill occurred, currents in the Florida Straits could carry the oil to U.S. waters and coastal areas in Florida, posing a risk to marine and coastal resources. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill recommended negotiating with Mexico and Cuba to establish common standards and protocols for containment and response strategies in case of a spill. While the U.S. and Cuba are not parties to a bilateral agreement on oil spills, they are signatories to multilateral agreements for cooperation. The United States and Cuba are signatories to multilateral agreements under the International Maritime Organization for oil spill prevention and response. They finalized the Wider Caribbean Region Multilateral Technical Operating Procedures in 2014. U.S. oil spill mitigation companies can be licensed to provide support in case of an oil spill, and the U.S. Coast Guard is prepared for immediate response.
