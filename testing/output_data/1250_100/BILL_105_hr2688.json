    "content": "The Act titled \"Economic Development Information Act of 1997\" is declared in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings and declarations. Congress finds that accurate and timely information on economic development programs is crucial for maintaining the national economy and assisting regions with high unemployment. Previous efforts by the Economic Development Administration have been successful in aiding communities affected by military base closures or defense industry downsizing. To maintain the national economy at a high level, expanding the provision of economic development information is crucial. This information should be easily accessible to assist areas facing economic distress or long-term deterioration, offering access to various Governmentwide and other economic development resources in a user-friendly format. The Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on the Office of Economic Development Information. This aims to provide easily accessible economic development resources to areas in need. The Secretary will establish an Office of Economic Development Information within the Economic Development Administration. The Office will serve as a central information hub for economic development programs at the federal, state, and local levels, assisting applicants in finding and applying for assistance. It will also create electronic links to databases to facilitate the identification and application for resources under these programs. The Office of Economic Development Information will develop electronic links to databases containing relevant information on federal, state, and local economic development programs, including key contacts, application processes, eligibility criteria, and economic data and trends. The Office of Economic Development Information provides resources on economic development, technology utilization programs, best practices, and sources of capital for businesses. They also offer information on sustainable development initiatives and ensure public access to their information clearinghouse. The Office of Economic Development Information provides accessible resources through various means such as an Internet web site, toll-free telephone number, online electronic access, printed manuals, orientation workshops, and information specialists for person-to-person assistance. The Office of Economic Development Information offers resources for person-to-person assistance. The Secretary will coordinate with other federal departments for the objectives of economic development, including economic adjustment, disaster recovery, industrial retention, and defense reinvestment. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose."
