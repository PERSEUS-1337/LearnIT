    "content": "The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, reduce threats to endangered species, and provide efficiency tools for project streamlining. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community,\" \"at-risk forest,\" and \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines an authorized wildfire prevention project as measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and endangered species habitat on Federal lands. This may include activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest projects. Federal lands refer to National Forest System land or public lands. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" on Federal land is defined as areas crucial for endangered species or habitats identified in species recovery plans under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) allows for determining a species as endangered or threatened, and designating critical habitat. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects will be implemented in at-risk forests and on threatened and endangered species habitat to reduce surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects must enhance protection from wildfire for endangered species and comply with species recovery plan guidelines. In at-risk forests, authorized wildfire prevention projects can use grazing, timber harvesting, and thinning to reduce fuel loads and prevent catastrophic wildfires. The projects do not require revisions to land management plans. Public petitions for Federal land designation must be addressed within 60 days. Upon receiving a public petition for Federal land designation as at-risk forest or endangered species habitat, the Secretary must review and make a determination within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. Public Notice and Comment: The Secretary concerned must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register. The public can submit written comments within 30 days. Within 60 days of the initial notice, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit comments on the final designated project within 30 days. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws for wildfire prevention projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply if projects involve timber harvesting or grazing, with a 30-day deadline for preparing an environmental assessment. Failure to meet the deadline has consequences. The authorized wildfire prevention project is deemed compliant with environmental laws if the Secretary fails to meet the deadline for the environmental assessment. For livestock grazing projects, the assessment is valid for 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for 20 years. The Secretary is not required to consider alternatives in the assessment. Compliance with this section satisfies various environmental laws. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, and the Management Act of 1976 are key environmental laws that must be considered for compliance in various projects. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\nAdministrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted in accordance with the same Act.\n\nSEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS.\n\nBefore listing species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, research is conducted on the impact of listing on forest fuel loads. Endangered species recovery plans and critical habitat determinations must include wildfire risk assessment analysis."
