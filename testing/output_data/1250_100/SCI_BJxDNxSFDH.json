The model uses a Basis Function Learner network to encode basis functions and a Weights Generator network to generate weight vectors for novel tasks, outperforming current meta-learning methods in various regression tasks. Regression involves learning a model that relates inputs to outputs, typically trained on a large dataset. In this work, a few-shot learning model is proposed for regression tasks. The model utilizes a Basis Function Learner network to encode basis functions and a Weights Generator network to generate weights for new tasks. By modeling F(x) as a linear combination of sparsifying basis functions, the model can estimate F(x) with just a few samples. The model proposed for few-shot regression tasks utilizes a Basis Function Learner network to encode basis functions and a Weights Generator network to generate weights for new tasks. The system learns basis functions that result in sparse representation for various tasks and produces predictions for regression tasks. The model reformulates regression as a few-shot learning problem, allowing for regression tasks to be performed on tasks sampled from the same distribution. Meta learning, also known as learning to learn, aims at adapting models across different tasks. Meta learning, also known as learning to learn, focuses on learning an adaptive model across different tasks. It has been applied to style transfer, visual navigation, and few-shot learning problems. Some approaches use a similarity metric between new test examples and few-shot training samples, while others learn how to optimize the model directly. Finn et al. (2017) achieved good performance by learning an optimal initialization of models for different tasks in the same distribution. In the context of meta learning, various approaches have been explored to optimize model parameters effectively, including employing LSTM for optimization algorithms and using generative models to overcome limitations in few-shot settings. Neural Processes algorithms model output distributions of regression functions using Deep Neural Networks, similar to Variational Autoencoders, by employing a Bayesian approach in an encoder-decoder architecture. Our model uses a deterministic approach to learn basis functions for regression, producing predictions through a dot product. It compares favorably to Neural Processes in few-shot regression. The approach is similar to dictionary learning but with significant differences, such as continuous problems and limited samples. The proposed method aims to develop a model for few-shot regression, regressing to various equations with only a few training samples. Tasks are continuous for regression, with training and testing sets containing training and validation samples. The main idea is to model the unknown function y = F(x) with sparse representation, assuming each function is drawn from an unknown distribution. The proposed method aims to learn a sparse representation of the unknown function F(x) using a set of basis functions. By using the Fourier basis, a few samples can adequately approximate the function, making it suitable for regression tasks with limited training data. Under Fourier basis, a sparse representation of the unknown function F(x) can be achieved with a small number of significant weights w i, making it suitable for regression tasks with limited training data. The Basis Function Learner Network encodes the set of {\u03c6 i (x)} for sparse representation, while the Weights Generator Network maps K training samples to a constant vector w. This model is applied for prediction on any input x during meta-training. The model uses task-specific weights and learned basis functions to make predictions. The loss function includes a mean-squared error term and penalties on the weight vectors to encourage sparsity and reduce variance. The loss function is similar to Elastic Net Regression but tailored for meta-learning tasks. The model uses task-specific weights and learned basis functions for predictions. Experimental results for various regression tasks are presented, showing the performance of different methods. In the experiments, the model uses task-specific weights and learned basis functions for predictions. The learning rate is set to 0.001, and the Adam Optimizer is used for optimization. The experiments include 1D Heat Equation and 2D Gaussian regression tasks. For the sinusoidal regression task, the target function is defined as y(x) = Asin(\u03c9x + b), with parameters A, b, and \u03c9.

The experiments include 1D Heat Equation and 2D Gaussian regression tasks. For the sinusoidal regression task, the target function is defined as y(x) = Asin(\u03c9x + b), with parameters A, b, and \u03c9. Following the setup from Li et al. (2017), the model is trained on tasks with batch size 4 and 60000 iterations for 5, 10, and 20 shot cases. The comparison is made against Meta-SGD, MAML, EMAML, BMAML, and the Neural Processes family of methods. The results are shown in Table 1, with two variants of the model differing in the size of the Weights Generator. The \"small\" and \"large\" models have different architectures, with the former having 2 fully connected layers with 40 hidden units each, and the latter having 5 fully connected layers with 40 hidden units each. The Neural Process family of methods uses an encoder architecture of 4 fully connected layers with 128 hidden units and a decoder architecture of 2 fully connected layers with 128 hidden units, similar to the larger model. Additionally, two variants of EMAML and BMAML lack a separate network to generate weight vectors but are ensemble methods that aggregate results from multiple model instances. In this experimental setup, the model is evaluated on a sinusoidal task with expanded ranges for parameters A, b, and \u03c9, along with added noise. The model is trained on 1000 tasks and tested using an ensemble version with 10 separate instances. Results show superior performance in both 10 shot and 5 shot cases compared to recent few-shot regression methods. Regression methods were tested on challenging image data using MNIST and CelebA datasets. Each image is treated as a continuous function with normalized pixel values. Meta-training involved sampling points from images to form regression tasks, with MSE evaluation during meta-testing. The comparison was made with NP family models for different point samples. Deeper network structures were used due to the complexity of regression on image data. The study utilized deep neural networks with multiple layers and attention blocks for regression tasks on image data. Results showed that their method outperformed other NP models and approached the performance of the most recent ANP. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated on high-dimensional predictions from CelebA image data. The study also discussed the basis functions learned by their method, highlighting their sparsifying nature for regression tasks. The study demonstrated the sparsity of basis functions by selecting only the S largest weights and corresponding functions for regression tasks. Results showed that using a small number of basis functions could produce accurate predictions, highlighting the effectiveness of the method. Ablation studies were conducted to validate design choices in the model. The ablation studies focused on testing the effects of self-attention operations and penalty terms on the model's performance. By replacing self-attention operations with fully connected layers, the model showed improved performance on the sinusoidal regression task. Additionally, experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of different penalty terms on the generated weights vector. The study evaluated different variants of loss functions with L1 and L2-norm penalty terms for sinusoidal regression. Results showed that the combination of both penalties yielded the best performance. The model with only L1 penalty had the highest percentage of sparse weights, while the model with both penalties performed better overall. The study found that a model with both L1 and L2 terms performed better in regression tasks, maintaining a high percentage of near zero weights. They introduced a few-shot meta learning system focusing on regression tasks, using a Basis Function Learner network to encode basis functions and a Weight generator network to generate weights. The model showed competitive performance in various regression tasks, with 22 out of 40 basis functions being non-zero, representing different components of the sinusoidal function. The study focused on the importance of basis functions in sinusoidal regression tasks. By removing certain basis functions, the prediction accuracy was significantly affected. Even removing just 4 important basis functions resulted in a less accurate prediction than using only 10. This highlights the significance of specific basis functions in the prediction process. The Weights Generator Network architecture consists of self attention blocks followed by a fully connected layer. Each attention block includes a self attention operation, two fully connected layers, a residual connection, and layer normalization. The input to the first attention block is the input to the network, while subsequent blocks take the output of the previous block. The self-attention operation involves transforming the input into query, key, and value vectors for a scaled dot-product operation. The Weights Generator Network architecture includes self attention blocks with a fully connected layer. Each block involves a self-attention operation with query, key, and value vectors for a scaled dot-product operation. The method is evaluated on a 1D Regression task, specifically the 1D heat Equation task, where the goal is to model the temperature at each point of a rod after applying a heat source. The experiments involve setting the rod length to 5, sampling points on the heat equation curve, and evaluating the model on different shot cases. The results are compared to EMAML and BMAML on this regression task. The evaluation includes tasks like 2D Gaussian regression and CelebA dataset analysis. The model is compared to EMAML and BMAML on regression tasks. The results are presented in tables and figures for clarity. The proposed sparse linear representation framework for few shot regression is compared to dictionary learning. While both focus on efficient representations of signals, few shot regression aims to predict entire continuous functions with limited samples, unlike the discrete nature of dictionary learning. The Basis Function Learner network aims to predict entire continuous functions with limited samples, which is more challenging than typical Deep Learning algorithms. The basis matrix \u03a6 has infinite entries and is encoded by the network."
