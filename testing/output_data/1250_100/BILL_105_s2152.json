The \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\" highlights findings on severe poverty in the developing world, high child mortality rates, preventable deaths from malnutrition, and the challenges faced by women in poverty. Directly aiding the poorest, especially women, can positively impact family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Women in the developing world often lack stable employment and turn to self-employment for livelihood. The poor entrepreneurs face challenges accessing credit at reasonable rates, leading to high interest payments to money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to provide financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, benefiting nearly half of the world's absolute poor. Access to microcredit can significantly increase incomes and business growth for the poor. Through self-sustaining microcredit programs, poor individuals can combat hunger and poverty. NGOs like Grameen Bank, Accion International, and FINCA have successfully lent to the very poor with high repayment rates. Microcredit institutions reduce poverty, decrease reliance on foreign aid, and leverage resources through loan recycling. Sustainable microcredit institutions are crucial for a global poverty alleviation strategy. AID's Microenterprise Initiative aimed to increase funding for microenterprise programs, with a goal to support programs providing credit to the poorest with loans under $300. However, funding fell in fiscal year 1996, hindering progress towards the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID should expand funding to $160,000,000 in fiscal year 1999 to align with the growing capacity of microcredit institutions in the developing world. To achieve the Microcredit Summit's goal of reaching millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand successful microcredit institutions and provide assistance in developing their capacity. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions to help the very poor achieve financial sustainability. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations to reach large numbers of the very poor. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and NGOs to expand successful microcredit institutions and provide financial services to the world's poorest families. The Act aims to continue and expand AID's commitment to develop microcredit institutions, make microenterprise development a key economic growth strategy, and support the capacity of United States. The Act aims to support PVOs and NGOs in providing credit, savings, and training services to microentrepreneurs, with a focus on increasing access to credit for the poorest sector in developing countries, especially women. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"AID\", \"microcredit\", \"microenterprise\", and \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\".

Programs will be carried out by US PVOs and other organizations, including credit unions and private financial intermediaries.

The entity focuses on working with poor women and aims to achieve financial self-reliance by charging realistic interest rates. Funding levels for fiscal year 1999 are specified, with a minimum of $160,000,000 allocated for assistance under the Act. In fiscal year 1999, funding of at least $80,000,000 is designated for poverty lending, $35,000,000 for support of PVOs and NGOs, and $10,000,000 for a matching grant program.
