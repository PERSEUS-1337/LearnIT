    "content": "The U.S. Trade Representative announced intent to negotiate a free trade agreement with Malaysia in 2006. Talks faced challenges on issues like government procurement policies, market access for services sectors, intellectual property rights, and automobile exports. In December 2008, U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia James Keith mentioned 23 unresolved trading issues in the FTA negotiations. The negotiations remained controversial in Malaysia, with support for continuing on certain topics like government procurement and intellectual property rights. Concerns arose about opening Malaysia's financial markets to U.S. companies due to the U.S. financial crisis. Various interest groups, including SMEs, called for terminating the negotiations, fearing harm to Malaysia's SMEs. In November 2008, Tony Pua of DAP suggested a \"white paper\" be prepared to ensure FTA negotiations align with government policies. The FTA talks with the United States were temporarily halted in January 2009 due to Malaysia's concerns over U.S. support for Israel's military operations in Gaza. Minister Muhyiddin stated Malaysia would not rush to conclude negotiations while the U.S. supported \"Israel's cruelty to Palestinian people.\" The Obama Administration indicated intentions to resume U.S.-Malaysia FTA negotiations after the inauguration. President Obama emphasized workers' rights and environmental issues in trade talks. Only two rounds of talks were held in 2008, with the third postponed at the U.S.' request. Following the failure to complete FTA negotiations in 2007, there was a perception in Malaysia that the Bush Administration did not prioritize relations with Malaysia. Ambassador Keith reassured the press of the U.S. commitment to the region and Malaysia, citing the passage of House Resolution 518 commemorating Malaysia's 50th anniversary. U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Barbara Weisel confirmed the U.S.'s intention to conclude the agreement by summer 2008 and seek congressional approval once negotiations were completed. On January 14, 2008, Malaysia and the United States began their seventh round of formal negotiations in Kuala Lumpur over the terms of a possible U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement. The United States sought \"real, demonstrable progress\" during the talks, with no set deadline for completion. Ambassador Keith hoped for negotiations to finish by mid-2008. Key issues discussed included investment, trade, intellectual property rights, and legal matters. Both sides were optimistic about reaching an agreement by summer. Assistant USTR Weisel stated that significant progress had been made during the recent talks on the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement. However, there were conflicting reports on the status of the negotiations, with Minister Rafidah Abdul Aziz seeing no need for a deadline while Ambassador Keith hinted at focusing on other trade agreements if the FTA with Malaysia was not completed by July. The lack of a decision on the next round of talks also raised concerns about the agreement's timeline. The negotiations for the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement faced uncertainty over the date and place for the next round of talks. Despite some progress, Minister Rafidah suggested that further meetings may not be necessary. The eighth round of negotiations focused on various trade topics, but political events in both countries overshadowed the discussions. The U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement negotiations faced uncertainty due to political events in both countries. Key issues included foreign access to Malaysian government procurement contracts, market access for U.S. agricultural exports and service providers, and sensitive areas like agriculture. Progress was made during the eighth round of negotiations. During the eighth round of negotiations, Malaysia and the United States discussed business collaboration and capacity-building in the services sector under the Malaysia-U.S. FTA framework. The U.S. hoped Malaysia's government procurement reforms would advance FTA talks. Malaysia's willingness to discuss government procurement was seen as a positive step. The U.S. took a pragmatic approach in negotiations, but using the Singapore FTA model caused challenges in talks with Malaysia. The ninth round of negotiations scheduled for late 2008 was postponed. In late 2008, the ninth round of Malaysia-U.S. FTA negotiations was postponed after the U.S. presidential elections. Malaysia planned to hold the round in Kuala Lumpur in November 2008, but Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the FTA couldn't be concluded with the current U.S. administration. The U.S. government wanted to postpone further negotiations until the Obama Administration took office. U.S. Ambassador Keith expressed interest in concluding the FTA negotiations early in the new administration. Malaysia, as a predominantly Muslim nation, has a history of supporting the Palestinian struggle against Israeli oppression. Ahmad Badawi condemned Israel's military actions in Gaza, leading to calls for a boycott of U.S. goods in Malaysia. The Malaysian Bar Council urged a review of FTA negotiations with the United States in protest of perceived support for Israeli atrocities. The Malaysian government suspended FTA negotiations with the United States following calls for a boycott of U.S. goods due to perceived support for Israeli atrocities. The decision was made by Minister Muhyiddin in response to events in Gaza and was later postponed at the request of the United States until after the presidential inauguration. Key unresolved issues in the negotiations include intellectual property rights protection, market access for U.S. automobiles and agricultural goods, trade in services, and government. Malaysia has tightened its laws on intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement, but issues still persist. The Business Software Alliance reported high software piracy rates in Malaysia, leading to significant industry losses. Malaysia remains on the Special 301 Watch List for IPR improvements. The USTR acknowledged Malaysia's efforts to strengthen IPR protection but highlighted the need for further improvements, including the establishment of a specialized IPR court. Discussions on IPR protection for pharmaceuticals are ongoing in the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement negotiations. In Free Trade Agreement negotiations, Malaysia is concerned about U.S. push for stricter IPR provisions, particularly on compulsory licensing and data exclusivity for pharmaceuticals. This could impact access to affordable anti-retroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS patients in Malaysia. The Malaysian government has promoted its domestic automobile industry for years, with manufacturers like Proton and Perodua exporting vehicles to over 40 countries. The industry is protected by high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, with incentives for national car producers. However, the government is starting to dismantle these protections to comply with international trade agreements. The Malaysian government has been dismantling protections for its domestic automobile industry to comply with international trade agreements, such as the WTO and ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. Despite eliminating local content requirements, government policies like excise taxes still hinder open trade in the automotive sector. Malaysia imposes high tariffs on vehicles from outside ASEAN, with excise taxes ranging from 80-200% on automobiles. Negotiations may involve discussions on U.S. measures protecting its domestic automobile industry, including a special 25% tariff on pickup truck imports. The U.S. Automotive Trade Policy Council supports the proposed FTA as an opportunity to enter a market historically protective of domestic producers. Malaysia has designated rice as a \"strategic crop\" and excluded it from any FTA with the United States. Concerns about U.S. SPS regulations have been raised, with the U.S. pushing Malaysia to remove restrictions on agricultural goods trade. Financial services, particularly foreign ownership limits in banks, are also a challenging issue in the negotiations. Malaysia has lifted restrictions on foreign banks in the financial sector, allowing them to open new branches and seek credit without approval. However, concerns about foreign participation in the financial sector have been reignited due to the recent financial crisis in the United States. In telecommunications, foreign companies are also allowed to operate in Malaysia. In telecommunications and other sectors, Malaysia imposes restrictions on foreign participation, limiting equity stakes and licensing for professionals. The country uses a positive list approach for service sectors and is not a signatory of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Malaysia seeks to increase bumiputera participation in the economy by requiring foreign companies to have a local partner for bids. The government procurement process is considered non-transparent, with restrictions on Malaysian business for bumiputera causing issues in negotiations. Malaysian companies are interested in accessing the larger U.S. government procurement market. The United States has limited access to its government procurement, offering the opportunity to bid on $250 billion in contracts. The Malaysia government procurement market is valued at approximately $20 billion. Government procurement was not a major topic in negotiations in 2008. The proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA is of interest to Congress due to the need for approval, trade liberalization trends, potential controversial provisions, and impact on trade flows affecting U.S. businesses. Senator Max Baucus welcomed the USTR's 2006 FTA announcement. The USTR's 2006 FTA announcement received positive responses from Senator Max Baucus, Representatives Jim Kolbe and Dan Burton, and the National Association of Manufacturers. A U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Business Coalition was formed in March 2006. Some objections to the proposed FTA came from Malaysian and U.S. labor unions, farmers, fishermen, and academics. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA was part of the Bush Administration's strategy to promote global economic growth through free markets and free trade. The proposed U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aims to achieve the \"Bogor Vision\" of free and open trade in the Pacific. The FTA is seen as an alternative to the stalled Doha Round of multilateral trade talks. The USTR outlined four major goals for the FTA, including creating new opportunities for U.S. manufacturers and strengthening economic partnerships in the region. Other benefits mentioned include cementing a vibrant U.S.-Malaysia economic relationship, increasing exports, diversifying exports, and promoting knowledge sharing between companies. The Ministry of International Trade in Malaysia is leading the negotiations for the proposed U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Their objectives include seeking better market access for Malaysian goods and services, promoting bilateral trade and investment flows, enhancing competitiveness of Malaysian producers, and building capacity through technical cooperation. The FTA is comprehensive, covering liberalization of goods and services, trade and investment promotion, investment protection, and economic and technical cooperation programs. Malaysian industries are generally supportive of the FTA, expecting benefits from increased collaboration and market access. Malaysian industries, including clothing, textiles, ceramics, lumber, rubber, and consumer electronics, support the proposed U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for greater access to the U.S. market. Malaysia aims to attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve access to Southeast Asian economies through FTAs with various countries. Negotiations for a bilateral FTA with Chile have also begun. The U.S. government sees the FTA as a way to strengthen economic ties with Malaysia. The USTR aims to strengthen relations with Malaysia through a proposed FTA, highlighting Malaysia's strategic role in U.S. foreign policy. The FTA is expected to enhance cooperation in various areas and reinforce shared interests between the two countries. Opposition to the FTA has arisen from labor unions in the United States. Opposition to the proposed US-Malaysia FTA has emerged from labor unions, environmental protection organizations, and \"anti-globalization\" groups in the United States and Malaysia. The AFL-CIO opposes additional FTAs without meaningful protections for workers' rights and environmental standards. Labor organizations seek to bring partner countries' labor laws up to International Labor Organization standards and include dispute settlement mechanisms in agreements. Labor conditions in Malaysia have faced international criticism, with concerns about workers' rights and trade union activity. Only 9.5% of the labor force in Malaysia is represented by trade unions, with reports of delays in legal recognition. Immigrant workers, mainly from Indonesia, are reportedly facing abuse and exploitation. Opposition to a US-Malaysia FTA has been organized in Malaysia. Opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been organized in Malaysia, with concerns raised about the impact on rice farmers, fishermen, and pharmaceutical drug costs. Public Citizen criticizes the FTA model for promoting deregulation and privatization. Special interest groups and opposition parties in Malaysia have called for a halt to negotiations until a study on the economic and social impact is conducted. Opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been organized in Malaysia due to concerns about the impact on various sectors like rice farmers, fishermen, and prescription drug costs. U.S. support for Israel's military operations in Gaza has also complicated negotiations, as Malaysia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. Previous opposition concerns in other FTAs have been addressed through legislative provisions or commitments from the Administration. The Bush Administration promised $40 million for labor and environmental enforcement in the proposed FTA, ensuring no interference with the sugar program through FY2007. Commitments were made for the textile and apparel industry regarding rules of origin, customs enforcement, and promoting the use of U.S. fabric. Free trade agreements aim to reduce trade barriers, tariffs, import quotas, and non-tariff barriers, while also addressing intellectual property protection and dispute settlement processes. Free trade agreements (FTAs) aim to reduce trade barriers and address issues such as business visas, competition policy, and economic activity. Winners of FTAs are exporters, investors, and consumers, while losers are companies and workers in import-competing industries. FTAs with Malaysia would be the third FTA negotiation by the United States with a Southeast Asian nation. The United States also has FTAs with Australia and is negotiating with South Korea. Past FTAs usually provide for tariff-free trade with a phase-in period for sensitive sectors. An FTA with Malaysia would open markets restricted by tariffs and non-tariff barriers, benefiting U.S. exports like semiconductors and computer parts. However, competitive products like motor vehicles and polyethylene face high duties in Malaysia. The potential impact of an FTA depends on factors like the size of bilateral trade flows and existing trade relations. Malaysia's key economic indicators are summarized in Table 1. Malaysia has been one of the fastest-growing economies globally, with a significant GDP and per capita income. The country's purchasing power parity is higher than Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. The United States is Malaysia's largest trading partner and foreign investor. In 2007, Malaysia's per capita income was $6,724, but its purchasing power parity was estimated at $13,570. In 2008, U.S. investment in Malaysia totaled $1.8 billion, making it the second largest foreign investor after Australia. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) can impact trade flows by diverting trade towards involved countries, lowering tariffs, and causing a substitution effect. U.S. exports to Malaysia remained steady at around $10 billion from 2000 to 2005, increased to over $12.5 billion in 2006, and then declined to $11.7 billion in 2007. U.S. imports from Malaysia grew from 2001 to 2006 but declined in 2007, leading to a fluctuating bilateral trade deficit. According to Malaysia, exports to the United States increased by nearly 50% from 2000 to 2006, but then slipped in 2007. Malaysia's imports from the United States also fluctuated during this time. The trade surplus with the United States was $6.5 billion in 2000 and $11.6 billion in 2006. The United States is Malaysia's top export market, followed by Singapore, Japan, and China. Malaysia's exports to the United States declined from 19.7% to 15.6% over the last three years, while China's share increased. Japan remains Malaysia's top source of imports, with the United States sliding to fourth place since 2005. In 2005, China and Singapore surpassed the United States as Malaysia's top suppliers of imported goods. Malaysia has FTAs with Japan and Singapore and is negotiating with Australia, India, New Zealand, and Pakistan. China has an FTA with ASEAN, including Malaysia, with a trade in services agreement since July 2007. The proposed FTA with the United States would align U.S. exporters with China, Japan, and Singapore. Malaysia's services trade with the U.S. was less than $2 billion annually from 2000 to 2004, reaching just above $2 billion in 2005. The United States has a growing interest in improving access to Malaysia's domestic market, especially in sectors like telecommunications, financial services, and insurance. U.S. companies have invested over $15 billion in Malaysia, with a significant portion in manufacturing, particularly in computer and electronic equipment. Additionally, U.S. companies have shown interest in chemical manufacturing operations in Malaysia, with approvals for several projects worth $878 million in 2007. In 2007, U.S. companies invested $878 million in 33 manufacturing projects in Malaysia, with a focus on electronic equipment and chemical industries. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA faced challenges due to the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority, leading to uncertainties on how the proposed FTA might be considered by Congress. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA faced challenges due to the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority. Congress could consider the FTA under a new TPA law, pass temporary TPA, or proceed without TPA allowing for potential amendments. Legislative policy options include consultations, oversight hearings, and working with interest groups. Close consultations with the Executive Branch could lead to changes in the draft agreement before signing. Measuring the degree of protection provided by tariff barriers is a complex process, with average MFN tariff rates in Malaysia at 8.1% compared to 4.8% in the United States. Both countries have peaks in tariff rates on certain products. Both the United States and Malaysia have peaks in tariff rates on certain products. Malaysia protects its agricultural sector with high tariff rates on items of interest to U.S. agriculture, such as grains, rice, oranges, apples, wheat flour, prepared food, beef, pork, ham, yogurt, chocolate products, and baby food. In contrast, the United States imposes a 350% tariff on tobacco products exceeding the import quota, with a 12.1% tariff rate within the quota. Malaysia's average MFN tariff rate for non-agricultural products is 8.7%, compared to 4.0% in the United States. In Malaysia, tariff rates are particularly high in sectors where the government is fostering industry growth. For transport equipment, the average tariff rate is 25.6%, for non-electrical machinery it is 6.3%, and for electrical machinery it is 9.2%. Average applied tariff rates are indicators of a nation's actual level of tariff protection, with Malaysia having an average applied tariff rate of 8.4% in 2006. In Malaysia, the average applied tariff rate in 2006 was 8.4%, more than twice the U.S. rate of 3.7%. Industrial goods have a 9.1% tariff rate in Malaysia compared to 3.7% in the United States."
