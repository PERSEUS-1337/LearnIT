    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. President Bush signed the law on January 23, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. The additional pay adjustment for federal white-collar employees in 2004 was 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. OPM published revised salary tables on March 4, 2004. The pay adjustments are not based on cost of living. Federal employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1% in January 2003. In January 2003, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% pay adjustment. In 2004, they also received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. The report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. The Executive Schedule pay is adjusted annually based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI determines a 2.7% pay adjustment for January 2004. The President can issue an alternative plan in case of national emergency or economic conditions, as seen in President Bush's 1.5% adjustment in August 2003. Bush issued an alternative plan for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. GS employees, as well as employees in certain positions, will receive a locality pay adjustment in 2004. OPM published final regulations in December 2001 to clarify limitations on pay adjustments. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System will receive a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average percentage pay adjustment for white-collar employees, with a minimum increase in 2004 based on GS employees' adjustments. Blue-collar workers in Alaska, Hawaii, and other non-foreign areas receive a pay adjustment equal to GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees get the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental US receive a COLA allowance instead of locality pay. FEPCA established the locality-based comparability payments procedure to address pay disparities greater than 5%. The President can adjust locality-based payments in emergencies or economic crises. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to provide a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented the alternative plan, which was based on Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys documenting non-federal rates of pay in each pay area. The surveys were conducted under the National Compensation Survey program, not approved for use with previous locality payments. The National Compensation Survey program provides data for locality payments from January 2000 to January 2003. OPM compares federal and non-federal salaries to reduce the pay gap to 5% annually. FEPCA mandates closing a percentage of the gap each year, starting with 20% in 1994. The locality pay gap reduction process began in 1994 with a mandate to close a percentage of the gap each year. By January 2002, FEPCA specified that payments should not be less than the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The pay gaps used for locality payments are based on data that is 22 months old by the adjustment date. The locality pay gap reduction process started in 1994 to close the pay gap each year. By January 2002, payments were mandated to reduce the disparity to 5%. The gaps for locality payments are determined using outdated survey data, aged to a common reference date in March 2002. The Federal Salary Council reported in March 2002 that the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, recommended locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. Comparing 2003 locality payments with those recommended for 2004 resulted in recommended increases ranging from 11.90% to 25.23% in different pay areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 15.15% nationwide average net pay increase in 2004. The council suggested that areas with pay gaps below RUS receive the same adjustment as RUS. They also recommended not dropping certain pay areas in 2004 due to incomplete improvements in NCS and varying data sources. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas in 2004 and suggested criteria for determining locality pay areas, including population data and economic linkage. An exception was recommended for Barnstable County, MA, to be included in the Boston pay area due to its unique circumstances. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining current pay areas in 2004 and suggested criteria for determining locality pay areas. An exception was recommended for Barnstable County, MA, to be included in the Boston pay area due to its unique circumstances. St. Mary's County, MD, and Santa Barbara County, CA, have also been included in specific pay areas since 1994. New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA, have seen a decrease in employment below the 2,000 employee threshold. Santa Barbara County, CA, has fallen below the 2,000 employee threshold required for a pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining New London and Santa Barbara as pay areas for 2004, with plans to review the locality pay program in 2003. Monterey County, CA, and the State of Rhode Island are also recommended to be included in pay areas in 2004. Rhode Island was recommended to be included in the Boston pay area in 2004 as it meets the criteria for a \"Full State\" designation due to its small size. The state is considered as a single county and continues to be included in the pay area. Additionally, a portion of Edwards Air Force Base has been included in the Los Angeles pay area since 1994. The council recommended that Force Base be included in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004. Improvements were suggested for the BLS National Compensation Survey program, including using a three-factor system for grade levels and developing a model to estimate missing data. OPM and BLS collaborated to improve job classification and salary estimation by developing a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the Standard Occupational Classification System. They also implemented a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the level of work supervised. Testing of the new methods is planned for December 2003 surveys. The council recommended criteria to exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government. BLS methods were used to identify and exclude non-Federal jobs above GS-15. The council expressed concerns about the reliability of NCS data and recommended improvements. Additional resources should be allocated to increase survey sample sizes in localities with significant pay gaps. Metropolitan areas are defined using OMB definitions. The OPM published final regulations in 2003 regarding changes to locality pay areas based on OMB definitions of metropolitan areas. The GS locality pay regulations were modified to align with former OMB statistical area definitions, allowing for review before making recommendations in 2003. The council and Pay Agent in 2003 considered new statistical area definitions for the locality pay program, including the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas'. Changes in population density criteria and commuting thresholds were discussed in public meetings, with a recommendation to use the new definitions in the program pending further study. The report recommended using new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, with changes in demographics and criteria. The working group suggested using CSAs for pay adjustments in January 2005, expanding pay area definitions, and folding three pay areas with low pay gaps. The working group recommended folding current pay areas with low pay gaps into RUS to save resources for surveying other areas. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved by the Pay Agent and the President for the January 2005 pay adjustments. OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register for public comments. An amendment by Representative Sam Farr in H.R. 2989 states that funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Farr worked on the issue of pay reduction for federal employees in Monterey County, California. An amendment was passed to prevent the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. Section 644 of the Transportation/Treasury bill in FY2004 prevented the implementation of regulations for locality pay areas inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations. The Pay Agent's report recommended against locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, suggesting alternative approaches for Federal employee compensation. The Pay Agent's report recommended against locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. The cost of the January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion if the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5% were provided in January 2004 as required by FEPCA. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, as part of the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent stated that recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program focused on problems associated with the program. The Pay Agent's report recommended against locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. The Pay Agent stated that improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program focused on problems associated with random selection of survey jobs, matching federal and non-federal jobs, and excluding jobs above GS-15. The Pay Agent encouraged expedited completion of remaining improvements for the NCS surveys. Once annual and locality pay percentages are determined, pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic GS schedule by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The net increase in pay is derived by comparing the resulting pay rates with 2003 pay rates. President George W. Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay. The cost of the adjustment would be about $2 billion dollars, according to OMB and OPM. The alternative plan for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004 would cost about $2 billion dollars, according to OMB and OPM. Executive Order 13322 implemented this plan, which also included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989. The House passed legislation on July 30, 2003, contingent on the creation of a fund within OPM for performance pay plans. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the fund, believing it should be managed within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate on October 23, 2003. In the closing days of the 108th Congress, H.R. 2989 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The act provided $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, with funding contingent on the establishment of the fund within OPM. Approval from relevant subcommittees of jurisdiction was required before funds could be transferred to federal agencies for performance pay plans. The provision was enacted in P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The President's alternative plan warned of potential hiring freezes to cover higher pay rates above the proposed 2 percent raise. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. They suggested a broad-band system with fewer pay grades, allowing managers to determine pay based on competence and performance. Pay banding systems are already being implemented in various agencies. Pay parity provisions in P.L. 107-123 allow the SEC to raise salaries for certain employees. New HRM systems for civilian employees of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in P.L. 107-296 and P.L. 108-136. Changes to pay setting systems at both agencies are expected to include broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, setting amounts independently from the President's recommendations. The resolutions introduced in Congress aimed to achieve pay parity between military and civilian employees, with letters urging support for equal pay raises. The FY2004 budget proposed a 4.1% increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The House of Representatives passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 by a narrow margin. The House of Representatives passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 by a 215 to 212 vote on March 21, 2003. The resolution included language advocating for equal pay raises for civilian employees and members of the uniformed services. The Senate version also supported this provision as a Sense of the Senate. The resolution serves as a framework for Congress to consider spending legislation, with recommendations for civilian federal pay adjustments typically included in appropriations bills. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004 (H.R. 2989) proposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill does not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies approved the bill for consideration by the full committee, and the House Committee on Appropriations ordered it to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives. Representative Steny Hoyer, along with Representatives James Moran and Frank Wolf, proposed an amendment for the 4.1% pay adjustment, which was included in the bill. The House passed a bill proposing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, which the Bush Administration opposes. They suggest a 2.0% pay raise instead, citing concerns about the economy and proposing a Human Capital Performance Fund for higher pay raises for high-performing employees. The House passed a bill proposing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, costing DOD about $660 million. The Bush Administration opposes this increase, suggesting a 2.0% raise instead and proposing a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund for high-performing employees. The bill's 4.1% pay adjustment exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases, but does not address turnover issues. Federal employee satisfaction with pay rate is high, with a low quit rate of 1.7% per year. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security would limit flexibility. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 1589, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with the full committee approving the bill on a 29-0 roll call vote. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment for the pay adjustment, which was agreed to by voice vote. This adjustment would apply to employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, on a 91 to 3 vote on October 23, 2003, providing a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The pay adjustment would be absorbed within appropriated levels, with a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment recommended. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 incorporated this pay adjustment, with the House and Senate agreeing to the conference report in December 2003 and January 2004, respectively. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 provided a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, funded within appropriated levels. President Bush signed the bill into law, with additional 2.1% pay adjustment allocated through Executive Order 13332. The total cost of the pay adjustment was approximately $4.1 billion. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355, Federal White-Collar Pay: FY2005 Salary Adjustments. FEPCA provides that the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5%, with target pay gaps for each pay area. However, only a small percentage of the target pay gaps has been closed each year, falling short of the intended goal. The Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent report that the pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries averages 25.73% for 2004. Concerns have been raised about the flawed methodology for setting federal pay adjustments since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Despite these concerns, no proposals were made to change FEPCA, and the methodology remains a concern due to issues with survey data approval for determining locality payments in certain years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on methodological concerns regarding federal pay. The report highlighted the need for improvements in survey methodology. A white paper on compensation was issued in April 2002, discussing the review of current policies. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in November 2002 compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees, revealing that federal employees in certain occupations were paid less than their private sector counterparts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) compared federal employee salaries with private sector salaries, finding that 85% of federal employees were paid more than 20% less than their private sector counterparts. However, 30% of federal employees in technical and clerical occupations had salaries higher than those in the private sector. CBO noted concerns about the federal pay system, which does not vary pay raises by occupation, potentially leading to disparities in pay raises between different occupations. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) aims to provide federal pay comparable to the private sector, but implementing it fully would result in above-market salaries for some and below-market salaries for others. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimates reaching $8.830 billion. Unions advocate for pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal as inadequate. The unions criticized the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding of FEPCA. Bush's budget issues his standard rationale for failing to uphold FEPCA, citing problems with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability. The methodological problems seem to have spread to the Employment Cost Index component. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented. Executive Orders by President Bush provided a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment in January 2004, followed by an additional 2.1% pay adjustment in March 2004. The 2004 pay adjustments were calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) with the annual adjustment percentage and locality payment. The resulting pay rates were compared with 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online. MSA and CMSA refer to specific pay areas."
