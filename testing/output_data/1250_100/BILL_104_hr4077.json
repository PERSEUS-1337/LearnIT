    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 1996\". The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, later amended to include agreements with Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to regulate hunting of migratory birds to prevent overharvesting. Prohibitions on certain hunting methods, including baiting, have been in place for over 60 years and are widely accepted among the hunting community. The hunting of migratory birds using baiting or on baited areas has led to interpretive difficulties and inconsistent enforcement. Regulations need clarification to protect the bird resource while ensuring fair chase principles are upheld. Restrictions on habitat management may hinder the benefits for wildlife food crops. SEC. 3. CLARIFYING HUNTING PROHIBITIONS. Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to prohibit the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including traps, firearms with certain capacities, sinkboxes, and motor vehicles or aircraft. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including traps, firearms with certain capacities, sinkboxes, and motor vehicles or aircraft. Additionally, it prohibits hunting from motorboats or sailboats unless the motor is off and progress has ceased, using motor-driven conveyances to concentrate or stir up birds, and using live birds as decoys. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including traps, firearms with certain capacities, sinkboxes, and motor vehicles or aircraft. It also prohibits hunting with the aid of baiting or on baited areas where bait is present. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits hunting migratory game birds with bait present, except in specific circumstances such as on standing crops or lands where feed has been distributed for agricultural purposes or wildlife management. The presence of moist soil on emergent marsh plants is allowed if it occurs naturally or as a result of normal wetland habitat practices by the landowner or their agent. This includes various wetland plant species like watergrass, smartweed, bulrush, wild rice, and cattail. The term 'baiting' refers to intentionally placing feed to attract migratory game birds in areas where hunting is taking place. A 'baited area' is where such feed is intentionally placed, remaining so for 10 days after removal. 'Normal agricultural operations' include crop growing, erosion control planting, and grain distribution. The term 'baiting' refers to intentionally placing feed to attract migratory game birds in areas where hunting is taking place. 'Normal agricultural operations' include crop growing, erosion control planting, and grain distribution or scattering of grains in a region, excluding distributing or scattering of grain once removed from a field unless for feed for farm animals in the region. Other activities can be considered normal agricultural operations if approved by the Secretary of the Interior and published annually in the Federal Register. The terms 'attraction' and 'attracting' refer to the bait being a major factor in luring migratory birds within shotgun range, considering factors like location, hunting area characteristics, and methods used. SEC. 4 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to deposit fines into a conservation fund for acquiring bird refuges. SEC. 5 amends penalties to allow posting bond instead of seizing property."
