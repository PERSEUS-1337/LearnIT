Congress acknowledges the importance of infrastructure investments in creating jobs and addressing critical needs in the US. Data from the Brookings Institution shows that infrastructure jobs employ a significant portion of the workforce and offer competitive wages. The American Society of Civil Engineers has given low grades to the US infrastructure, highlighting the need for significant investment by 2025. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave a \"D+\" grade to the Nation's wastewater infrastructure, estimating a $150 billion investment needed by 2025. There are around 240,000 water main breaks annually in the US, wasting two trillion gallons of drinking water. The EPA reported lead exposure risks in drinking water, affecting 6.5 to 10 million homes with lead service lines. Congress established the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in 1996 to aid public water systems in meeting federal regulations. EPA conducts periodic surveys on water quality. In 2013, the EPA estimated $384 billion needed for drinking water infrastructure improvements over 20 years. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2 billion for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. Past appropriations are insufficient to address the infrastructure needs. Revolving Funds are inadequate to meet the significant need for investments in drinking water infrastructure in the US. Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2017 for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, and allowing the funds to remain available for 6 years, will help expand investments in communities. Restricting appropriations for the funds undermines economic recovery and disrupts planning, while emergency supplemental appropriations can improve infrastructure and create jobs. An emergency supplemental appropriation of $7.5 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in fiscal year 2017 will help improve drinking water infrastructure and create jobs in the United States. The funds will be available for 6 years, allowing states to distribute funds to eligible water systems and communities to develop improvement plans. An additional $7.5 billion is appropriated for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in fiscal year 2017, designated as an emergency requirement and exempt from sequestration under the Balanced Budget Act of 1985."
