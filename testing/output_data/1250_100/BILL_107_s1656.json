    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Benefits Administration Improvement Act of 2001\". The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for processing veterans' compensation and pension claims accurately and timely. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of claims processing, with new measurements showing lower accuracy rates than previously reported. Adequate training for claims adjudicators is crucial, especially with a potential 30 percent workforce loss by 2003. The Veterans Benefits Administration must improve processing of veterans' claims to avoid delays in providing compensation and pension benefits. In 2001, the expected appeals processing time was 621 days, and there was a backlog of 533,029 claims. The Veterans Benefits Administration must improve processing of veterans' claims to avoid delays in providing compensation and pension benefits. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF PROCESSING OF VETERANS BENEFITS CLAIMS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a plan for improving claims processing within 90 days of this Act. The plan includes mechanisms for better training of adjudicators, enhancing accountability standards, and improving data collection to avoid errors and delays in benefit payments. The plan for improving claims processing includes mechanisms for reviewing accuracy, evaluating the impact of training systems, setting quantifiable goals, consulting with veterans organizations, and implementing modifications as needed. The Secretary may modify the plan for improving claims processing, with any modifications taking effect after 30 days of notice. Reports assessing plan implementation must be submitted every six months, with funding from the Veterans Benefits Administration."
