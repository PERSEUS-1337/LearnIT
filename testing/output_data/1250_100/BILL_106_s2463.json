    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with African-Americans being overrepresented in executions and on death row. No state meets ABA standards for indigent prisoners' legal representation. The House Judiciary Subcommittee found that 89% of defendants selected for capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were African-American or Hispanic American. The General Accounting Office reported racial disparities in charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death penalty in 1990. Prisoner appeals have been limited, increasing the risk of imprisoning and executing innocent people. The Supreme Court has restricted death row prisoners' rights to appeal convictions and death sentences in Federal courts, even with compelling evidence of innocence. New legislation in 1996 further limited Federal court appeals. In 1996, new legislation restricted Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners. The Federal and State death penalty is currently on hold until Congress reviews the final findings and recommendations of the National Commission on the Death Penalty. This moratorium will continue until legislation is enacted based on the Commission's guidelines and procedures.
