    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. The Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act aims to provide local governments with funding for brownfields redevelopment independent of community development block grant funds, making it more accessible to communities. The purpose of the Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act is to increase accessibility to brownfields redevelopment funds for local governments and Indian tribes by allowing grants to be made independent of section 108 loan guarantees. SEC. 3. BROWNFIELDS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE. This section amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to add a new initiative for brownfields development. The Secretary may make grants to eligible public entities and Indian tribes for brownfield site development and redevelopment projects. Grant amounts must be used for specified activities and cannot reduce the financial responsibility of responsible parties for contamination. The Secretary may provide assistance for brownfield site development projects, but this does not absolve parties of liability for contamination. Grants do not have to be used in conjunction with loans guaranteed under section 108. Applications for assistance must follow established procedures. Selection criteria for assistance include the need for assistance, community distress levels, and the quality of proposed plans. The Secretary may provide assistance for brownfield site development projects based on the quality of proposed plans and the capacity of the applicant. The definition of a brownfield site includes sites meeting specific criteria under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. $50,000,000 is authorized for grants under this section for fiscal years 2007-2011. Technical amendment allows the use of CDBG funds for renewal communities. The amendment applies to funds for fiscal year 2007 and beyond."
