    "content": "The \"American Dream Downpayment Act\" is cited as the short title. The Act amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to include a Downpayment Assistance Initiative. The Secretary may grant assistance to low-income families for homeownership through downpayment assistance for single-family housing. Eligible families include low-income first-time homebuyers or those with uniformed employees or teachers in the participating jurisdiction. The downpayment assistance program is available to low-income families who meet income requirements set by the Secretary, with adjustments for family size. In high-cost areas, the income limit is raised to 150 percent of the median income. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a participating jurisdiction must include a description of grant use, conduct targeted outreach to residents of public housing, trailer parks, and manufactured housing, and ensure families receiving downpayment assistance are suitable for homeownership. The Secretary allocates assistance amounts based on a formula each fiscal year. The Secretary establishes a formula for allocating assistance to participating jurisdictions based on their need and prior commitment to homebuyer assistance. The formula considers various funding sources and factors, and reallocated amounts are distributed to other jurisdictions according to the formula. The formula for allocating assistance to participating jurisdictions is established by the Secretary based on need and prior commitment to homebuyer assistance. Reallocated funds from non-participating jurisdictions are redistributed to the State. Grants under this section are not subject to certain provisions of the title but are subject to specific requirements outlined in other sections. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act allows participating jurisdictions to use funds for administrative costs and planning. $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Additionally, a new section on relocation and downpayment assistance is added to the Act. The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 does not apply to downpayment assistance under this title. Passed by the House of Representatives on October 1, 2003."
