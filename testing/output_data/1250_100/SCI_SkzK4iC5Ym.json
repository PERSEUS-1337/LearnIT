    "content": "In this paper, a generalization of the BN algorithm called diminishing batch normalization (DBN) is proposed, updating BN parameters in a diminishing moving average way. The DBN algorithm maintains the structure of BN while introducing weighted averaging updates to some parameters, with an analysis showing convergence to a stationary point. This analysis, applicable to any activation function meeting common assumptions, is the first of its kind for convergence with Batch Normalization. The convergence analysis applies to any activation function meeting common assumptions, showing necessary conditions for stepsizes and weights to ensure convergence. In numerical experiments, more complex models with ReLU activation are used, showing that DBN outperforms BN on various datasets. BN addresses internal covariate shift by normalizing hidden layer inputs using batch statistics. This approach leads to a significant performance improvement in training deep neural networks. In this paper, a generalization of the Batch Normalization (BN) algorithm called Diminishing Batch Normalization (DBN) is proposed. DBN updates BN parameters in a diminishing moving average way, adjusting its output based on all past mini-batches. This helps to address the issue of BN depending on other patterns in the current mini-batch. A convergence analysis of DBN with a two-layer batch-normalized neural network and diminishing stepsizes is provided. The paper introduces Diminishing Batch Normalization (DBN), a generalization of the Batch Normalization (BN) algorithm. DBN updates BN parameters in a diminishing moving average way to address dependency on current mini-batches. The convergence analysis shows that DBN converges to a stationary point under specific conditions. Key contributions include necessary conditions for convergence and convergence to a stationary point under a nonconvex objective function. The paper introduces Diminishing Batch Normalization (DBN), a generalization of the BN algorithm. It presents main results showing that DBN outperforms BN. Previous works have shown the benefits of input whitening and decorrelation in deep learning. Various methods like local response normalization and standardization layers have been proposed, with BN serving as a basis for further improvements. Layer normalization BID2 is similar to BN but uses all inputs to compute mean and variance. It performs the same computation at training and test times. Different methods like weight normalization and normalization propagation aim to improve accuracy and reduce internal covariate shift. BN is the most popular technique, with various adaptations for different models like RNN and LSTM. Nonconvex convergence proofs are relevant for BN analysis. The optimization problem for a network involves an objective function with many component functions for data records. Parameters include common parameters updated by gradients and BN parameters introduced by the BN algorithm. The deep network analyzed has 2 fully-connected layers with D1 neurons each, and techniques can be extended to more layers. Each hidden layer computes y = a(Wu) with an activation function, and an intercept term is not needed due to the BN algorithm adjusting for it. The BN algorithm is applied to the output of the first hidden layer in the network. The computation in each layer is described to obtain the network's output. The notations introduced are used in the analysis, and the full structure of the network is shown in FIG0. The objective function for each sample is nonconvex with respect to the parameters. The algorithm studied involves using the full gradient instead of stochastic gradient descent in a Batch-Normalized Network. This method updates BN parameters using moving averages with diminishing alpha. The convergence properties of this method are compared to stochastic gradient descent. The algorithm studied involves using the full gradient instead of stochastic gradient descent in a Batch-Normalized Network. This method updates BN parameters using moving averages with diminishing alpha to improve convergence properties. The output of the BN layer becomes more general, reflecting the distribution of the entire dataset. Two strategies are used to determine the values of alpha, showing that Algorithm 1 outperforms the original BN algorithm in numerical experiments. The focus is on convergence analysis for nonconvex objective functions with specific assumptions. Assumptions for convergence analysis in nonconvex optimization problems include bounded parameters, diminishing updates, Lipschitz continuity of loss functions, existence of a stationary point, and Lipschitz activation functions. These assumptions are standard and hold for many common loss functions like softmax and MSE. The conditions for convergence analysis in nonconvex optimization problems include bounded parameters, diminishing updates, Lipschitz continuity of loss functions, existence of a stationary point, and Lipschitz activation functions. Theorems and lemmas are provided to specify sufficient conditions for convergence, with discussions on the convergence results of the algorithm. The main result of the study is Theorem 11, which does not immediately follow from Lemma 10 due to the lack of convergence proof for {\u03b8 (m)}. Necessary conditions for Theorem 7 and Lemma 8 are h > 1, h > 2, and k \u2265 1. Computational experiments were conducted using Theano and Lasagne on various datasets to compare the performance of DBN and BN algorithms. The study compares the performance of DBN and BN algorithms on various datasets using different neural network architectures. The models are trained with specific settings such as minibatch size of 100 and AdaGrad for updating learning rates. Results show that different choices of parameters converge properly. The study compares the performance of DBN and BN algorithms on various datasets using different neural network architectures. Results show that different choices of \u03b1 (m) converge properly, with \u03b1 (m) = 0.25 being the most robust choice. The selected set of efficient choices of \u03b1 (m) outperforms the original BN algorithm, suggesting the importance of considering mini-batch history for updating BN parameters. The DBN algorithm outperforms the original BN algorithm on various datasets with deep FNN and CNN models. An extension to more than 2 layers is feasible with significant notation augmentations. The proofs are condensed for submission. Proposition 12 states the existence of a constant M for any \u03b8 and fixed \u03bb. Lemma 14 discusses the convergence of a Cauchy series. The sequence {\u03bc} is a Cauchy series, with a constant M existing for any \u03b8 and fixed \u03bb. The convergence of the series is discussed in Lemma 14. The proof involves various inequalities and techniques to bound the derivatives with Lipschitz continuity. The convergence conditions for {\u03c3 (m) j } are the same as for {\u00b5}. These lemmas establish the proof of Theorem 7, with Proposition 17 providing an upper bound for |\u03bb (m) \u2212\u03bb|\u221e \u2264 am. The proof involves various inequalities and techniques to bound the derivatives with Lipschitz continuity. The text discusses bounding terms in equations 47 and 51 using Cauchy series and induction. Propositions 18 and 19 provide upper bounds under certain assumptions. The proof involves establishing inequalities and cases to bound derivatives with Lipschitz continuity. The text presents a proof involving equations and inequalities to establish bounds on derivatives with Lipschitz continuity. Lemmas 20 and 21 provide conditions for finiteness and sufficiency under certain assumptions. Theorem 11 is shown as a consequence of Theorem 7 and Lemmas 8, 9, and 10. The proof establishes bounds on derivatives with Lipschitz continuity using equations and inequalities. Lemmas 20 and 21 provide conditions for finiteness and sufficiency under specific assumptions. Theorem 11 is a consequence of Theorem 7 and Lemmas 8, 9, and 10. Lemma 8 holds based on the Cauchy series {\u03c3 (m)} and {\u00b5 (m)}. The proof is similar to Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis (2000). The conditions for \u03b7 (m) and \u03b1 (m) to satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 7 are h > 1 and k \u2265 1. The conditions for Lemma 8 are h > 2 and k \u2265 1."
