    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict among Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, shifting storage from current purposes like hydropower or navigation. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a key role according to the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal government has invested in water infrastructure primarily for flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose dams. Major projects were carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of large federal dams has slowed due to high costs and environmental concerns since the 1960s. Reservoir planning in recent decades has focused on balancing objectives for existing reservoirs, rather than new projects. Congress authorizes the Corps to construct dams and water infrastructure, with each dam operated to meet authorized purposes and federal laws. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Congress has also included additional requirements for all Corps facilities, such as fish and wildlife protection and recreation benefits. The 1958 Water Supply Act (WSA) and the Flood Control Act of 1944 provide the Corps with authority to allocate water for municipal and industrial (M&I) use. The focus is on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and the reallocation of storage in 44 Corps reservoirs. The 1944 authority for temporary M&I water supply is not likely to play a significant role in future reallocations. For legal issues related to the 1958 WSA, refer to CRS Report R40714 by Cynthia Brougher. The 1958 Water Supply Act (WSA) allows the Corps to allocate water for municipal and industrial (M&I) use, with limitations on decision-making without congressional approval. Congressional authorization is required for modifications that seriously affect the project's authorized purposes or involve major changes. The Corps developed guidelines for implementation, including criteria for when congressional approval is not needed for reallocations in reservoir projects. Modifications of reservoir projects to allocate storage for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply purposes do not require congressional approval if the reallocation is not greater than 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet. Questions have arisen regarding the Corps' discretionary authority and the number of reservoirs with storage reallocated. Lawsuits related to Lake Lanier in Georgia have brought attention to the issue, with a court order addressing whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes in operations. The court order in the Lake Lanier case found that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of the reservoir's storage without seeking congressional approval since the mid-1970s. This reallocation, totaling roughly 260,000 acre-feet, was primarily for municipal and industrial water supply. The court ruled that these actions exceeded the Corps' discretionary authority and raised concerns about similar reallocations at other Corps facilities. The Corps has reallocated water storage at various facilities, with 135 reservoirs holding 11 million acre-feet for M&I water. 44 reservoirs have M&I storage authority from the 1958 WSA, totaling less than 640,000 AF. Lake Texoma saw a reallocation of over 50,000 AF for M&I use, with four reallocations totaling 103,003 AF. A 1985 document approved an 84,099 AF reallocation from hydropower to M&I use at Lake Texoma, with compensation for lost hydropower. Other Texoma reallocations had specific congressional approval. The Corps reallocated water storage at various facilities under the 1958 WSA, with some exceeding the agency's policy limit without congressional approval. The reallocation at Cowanesque Lake was a mix of project-specific direction from Congress and discretionary authority. The 1958 WSA prohibits reallocations that seriously affect authorized purposes or result in major changes, with evaluations required before recommending to Congress. The 2009 court order questioned the Corps' evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations and the sufficiency of reallocation analyses. Unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses at Lake Cumberland have not been authorized or stopped. The extent of unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other Corps facilities is largely unknown. The 2009 court order raised concerns about reallocations at Corps facilities, including Lake Lanier. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation. Congress may need to address the Corps' use of discretionary authority for reallocations at federal facilities. Other issues include how multiple reallocations in a basin should be treated and the agency's discretion in making reallocations. The current policies on reallocations at Corps facilities involve decisions on M&I reallocations, financial arrangements, unauthorized withdrawals, and stakeholder agreements. Questions arise on how to handle transitions, charging for storage space, crediting return flows, and the federal role in municipal water supply amidst potential climate change effects. These issues prompt a reexamination of existing policies and tradeoffs. Addressing the national interest and challenges in current water resources infrastructure operations is complex due to differing opinions and difficulties in enacting changes."
