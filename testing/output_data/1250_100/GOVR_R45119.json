    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule finalized in 2015 to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Stakeholders have debated the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The CPP set national CO2 emission rates for existing power plants, allowing states to choose between rate-based or mass-based compliance approaches. The state would implement measures to achieve a statewide total emissions goal, providing flexibility in compliance options to minimize costs. EPA projected a 32% reduction in total power sector CO2 emissions nationwide by 2030 under the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The proposed repeal of the CPP marks a significant policy shift, based on a change in EPA's interpretation of its legal authority. The EPA estimated the benefits and costs of repealing emission goals for existing power plants, which would require measures outside the plants. The benefit-cost analysis of the repeal is significant as it shows methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, potentially impacting future regulations. Members of Congress are interested in understanding these changes, with 19 Senators requesting more information on the benefit-cost analysis. The EPA conducted a benefit-cost analysis for the proposed repeal of emission goals for power plants, showing methodological changes from the 2015 analysis. This analysis may influence future regulations on greenhouse gases and pollutants. The EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan, in accordance with Executive Order 12866. This order directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. The EPA follows Executive Order 12866 to analyze the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. Rules meeting specific criteria are considered economically significant and require detailed regulatory analysis according to OMB Circular A-4, which outlines best practices for assessing benefits and costs. The EPA follows Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 guidelines to analyze the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. The agency considers both quantified and non-quantified impacts in its regulatory decision-making process. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015, calculating state-specific emission rate goals. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under two illustrative scenarios for the Clean Power Plan using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). Compliance costs were based on changes in capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and other actions for compliance. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan, including costs for monitoring and reporting. The plan aimed to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with benefits monetized through the social cost of carbon. Additionally, human health benefits from reduced SO2 and NOx emissions were quantified as \"co-benefits.\" The EPA monetized human health benefits from reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. The estimates represented the value of reductions in premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to PM and ozone, with PM health effects accounting for most of the monetized health co-benefits estimates. The majority of the estimated PM health co-benefits came from reductions in premature deaths related to PM exposure, with SO2 emission reductions playing a significant role. Ozone health effects were also considered in the analysis. The EPA analyzed human health co-benefits in 2030 scenarios, with ozone effects contributing 6-12% of the estimated value. Under the Trump Administration, the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP, following the same rulemaking process. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) mandates adherence to the rulemaking process for promulgating, revising, or repealing rules. The repeal was based on a legal interpretation change, requiring a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. The EPA defined the benefits and costs of repealing the proposed CPP as avoided compliance costs and forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health benefits. EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. EPA used power sector modeling results from 2015 and 2017 to monetize compliance costs and benefits of repealing the CPP. They also changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings from negative costs to positive benefits. The EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2017 showed varying benefit-cost comparisons, with estimates ranging from net costs to net benefits. The 2015 analysis had consistently shown benefits outweighing costs, while the 2017 analysis presented a different picture. The 2017 estimates ranged from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits of the proposed repeal. The agency did not explicitly state its view on whether the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. The EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2017 showed varying benefit-cost comparisons, with estimates ranging from net costs to net benefits. The benefit-cost estimates derived from the AEO 2017 projections also showed a range of net costs and net benefits of the proposed repeal under different assumptions. The AEO-based estimates for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The effect of updated power sector projections on the proposed repeal's benefit-cost estimates is unclear. EPA noted that the benefit-cost estimates based on its 2015 power sector modeling did not reflect changes that have since occurred in the power sector. The AEO 2017 projections indicate changes in electricity demand, growth in renewable energy generation, retirements of older units, fuel price fluctuations, and regulatory changes. The projections suggest a shift to lower-emitting sources, potentially reducing CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA plans to update power sector modeling before finalizing the repeal. AEO 2017 also shows greater SO2 reductions and health co-benefits compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. The study found a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030 compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs, including revising estimates of the SCC, excluding international impacts, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes influenced the conclusions of the 2017 analysis. EPA and other agencies have used the SCC to value emissions reductions. The EPA and other federal agencies have used the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to value the climate benefits of CO2 reductions. The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. SCC values are calculated using models to estimate the monetary value of associated climate benefits. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) using SCC values developed by an interagency working group, ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. In 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates and disbanded the group. Executive Order 13783 directed federal agencies to develop new SCC values consistent with OMB Circular A-4, focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. The EPA developed new SCC values based on this directive, using the same models as the IWG but with different scope and discount rates. The EPA and the IWG used the same models for SCC estimates but with different scopes and discount rates. EPA approximated domestic SCC as 10% of global SCC from the DICE 2010 model. The interim domestic SCC estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. Stakeholders have debated using domestic or global SCC values. The EPA and the IWG disagreed on whether to use domestic or global SCC values. The IWG recommended global values due to the global nature of GHG emissions and their impacts. EPA agreed in 2015, citing the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Stakeholders supported global SCC, arguing that U.S. emissions cause damages beyond its borders. In 2015, stakeholders recommended federal agencies use domestic SCC estimates, citing OMB Circular A-4 guidance. Some criticized using global SCC values for U.S. climate regulations, stating it overstates benefits. EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis, following E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4 guidance. Circular A-4 allows consideration of global values but emphasizes benefits and costs accruing domestically. The 2017 EPA analysis focused on domestic SCC estimates, acknowledging challenges in accurately estimating the costs. Experts noted the difficulty in capturing relevant regional interactions, such as global migration and economic destabilization. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis. Circular A-4 provides discount rate recommendations for benefit-cost analysis, with rates of 3% and 7% based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate reflects the average saver's rate for future consumption, while the 7% rate represents the opportunity cost of capital. Discounting in the SCC calculation allows for economic impact comparisons over a long time period. The selection of a discount rate for calculating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. The current generation must choose a rate on behalf of future generations, impacting how climate change impacts are valued. Higher discount rates result in lower present values, while lower rates result in higher values, with SCC estimates being highly sensitive to the rate chosen. Ethical implications are acknowledged in benefit-cost analysis when comparing benefits. OMB Circular A-4 recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates for intergenerational benefits and costs. The Council of Economic Advisers suggested reducing the 3% rate to 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups for higher rates. Climate change studies often use lower discount rates according to published literature. The NAS recommended developing a new approach to calculate discount rates for climate change impacts studies, suggesting rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. EPA agreed with these rates in the 2015 CPP analysis, aligning with economic literature and OMB Circular A-4 guidance. The NAS emphasized the need for federal agencies to determine appropriate discount rates that capture uncertainty over long periods of time. The NAS recommended new discount rates for climate change impact studies, EPA used lower SCC values in 2017 analysis, reducing climate benefit estimates under the CPP. EPA acknowledged limitations and conducted sensitivity analysis with global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding human health co-benefits in some benefit-cost comparisons, which is inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. The agency used a threshold to reduce health co-benefits in certain comparisons, focusing on benefits from reductions in the targeted pollutant, CO2. EPA's rationale for focusing on targeted pollutants in regulatory actions and requesting public comment on the balance between benefits and costs. Stakeholders raised concerns about co-benefits and potential double counting of benefits in EPA's analysis. EPA's 2015 analysis stated that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations. Existing regulations of PM and emissions contribute to the formation of PM. OMB Circular A-4 and EPA's Guidelines emphasize the importance of considering co-benefits in economic analyses. OMB reports highlight that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. This practice is consistent with standard accounting practices and OMB Circular A-4 requirements. The EPA applied thresholds to estimate forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, diverging from past practices. They used thresholds based on federal air quality standards and the lowest measured levels from long-term studies to calculate PM mortality impacts. This approach assumed no deaths attributable to PM below the defined thresholds. The EPA used thresholds based on federal air quality standards and lowest measured levels from studies to estimate forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons. The PM air quality standard threshold had a greater impact on lowering estimates compared to the LML threshold. This approach aimed to enhance transparency and address uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks below the federal standard. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in the distribution of PM-related mortality benefits. EPA acknowledged uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits distribution, citing studies supporting a no-threshold model for PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. The agency's 2015 analysis recognized lower confidence in benefits at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold, stating federal air quality standards are not risk-free. The analysis concluded that benefits exist both above and below the federal air quality standard levels. EPA's 2017 analysis discussed estimating and reporting PM impacts, evaluating the benefit-per-ton approach, and conducting detailed air quality modeling. The analysis also mentioned the change in accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings. The EPA's 2017 analysis discussed the change in accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings, which resulted in higher estimates of costs and benefits for the proposed repeal of the CPP. This accounting change did not alter the net impact of the repeal but had significance in a cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771. The EPA's 2017 analysis included the results of its E.O. 13771 analysis, which reported cost savings from the proposed repeal of the CPP but omitted the forgone benefits. The cost savings analyzed under E.O. 13771 exceeded the compliance costs considered in the 2015 benefit-cost analysis. Benefit-cost analysis is crucial for informing policy decisions by providing a consistent framework for evaluation. The EPA's benefit-cost analysis informs policymaking by evaluating the effects of regulatory options. Decisionmakers consider various factors beyond monetary benefits, such as legal, technical, and ethical considerations. Quantifying benefits and costs can be complex, drawing upon scientific data and involving policy-based decisions. EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal illustrate this complexity. The EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal show how changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence benefit-cost estimates. The 2017 analysis reached different conclusions due to new SCC estimates and thresholds that altered economic impacts. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations. The decisions on regulations like the CPP can impact industries and the health of U.S. citizens. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. The 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates that differed from the IWG's estimates, impacting the estimated CPP climate benefits. The withdrawal of IWG SCC estimates may lead to differences in GHG-related regulations across federal agencies. EPA's 2017 analysis did not provide details on next steps for the SCC and its implications for other federal analyses. The EPA's 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates for regulatory analyses, with uncertainty on whether other agencies will follow suit. The Department of Energy continued using IWG SCC estimates in rulemaking despite their withdrawal. Congress may consider the precedent set by EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis for future air pollution rulemakings. The 2017 EPA analysis highlighted uncertainty in setting a threshold for PM reductions, departing from previous approaches. It also excluded health co-benefits in one benefit-cost comparison, contrary to federal guidance."
