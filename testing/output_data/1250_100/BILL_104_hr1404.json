    "content": "The policy of the United States aims to end animal suffering caused by steel jaw leghold traps by prohibiting their shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, along with fur from animals trapped in such traps. The Act defines terms such as \"article of fur,\" \"interstate or foreign commerce,\" \"import,\" and \"person\" for the purpose of regulating the fur trade. The term \"steel jaw leghold trap\" is defined as a device designed to capture an animal by snapping closed upon the animal's limb. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED ACTS AND PENALTIES.\n\nNo fur article can be imported, exported, or shipped if derived from an animal trapped in a steel jaw leghold trap. It is illegal to import, export, or possess such fur, transport leghold traps, or violate regulations. Violators face fines up to $1,000 for the first offense and up to $5,000 plus two years imprisonment for subsequent offenses.\n\nSEC. 4. REWARDS. The Secretary will pay half of the fine to anyone providing information leading to a conviction under this Act. Government officials are not eligible for rewards. The Secretary enforces the Act and regulations with the help of other agencies. Judges can issue warrants for enforcement. Individuals can detain, search, seize, make arrests without a warrant, and execute warrants for violations of the Act. Any item seized under this Act will be held by an authorized person pending criminal proceedings or forfeiture actions. The Secretary may allow the owner to post a bond instead. Forfeited items will be disposed of as prescribed by the Secretary. Fur or steel jaw leghold traps in violation of the Act are subject to forfeiture. The Attorney General can seek injunctions against violators. Any person alleged to violate provisions of this Act or its regulations may face legal action. The Secretary will create necessary regulations to enforce the Act, which will take effect one year after its enactment."
