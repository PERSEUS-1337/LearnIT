    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.67 of the Health and Safety Code adds regulations for online child care job posting services, defining them as businesses providing information on child care providers. Owners of these services must include specific information on their websites about each child care provider. Trustline is California's official background check for child care providers like babysitters and nannies. It has access to fingerprint records from the California Department of Justice and the FBI, as well as the Child Abuse Central Index. The trustline registry toll-free number is 1-800-822-8490, and the website is www.trustline.org. Free child care referrals are available in every county. The state-funded child care resource and referral program provides free child care planning services, including referrals to licensed caregivers, information on choosing child care, community resources, and help with paying for child care. To find your local program, call 1-800-KIDS-793 or visit www.mychildcareplan.org. Oliver's Law gives parents the right to information on complaints about child care providers, which can be obtained by calling the local licensing office or visiting www.ccld.ca.gov. The online child care job listing service must provide a one-click link on each child care provider profile with a written description of the background check offered. This description should include an overview of what is included in the background check, a chart listing databases checked for each county in California, and details on data sources, update frequency, and checking methods. The child care job listing service must include a clear indication of counties with no background check data available, a summary of the number of counties without data, lists of statewide/national and other background checks conducted, and relevant information as per specified requirements. Upon receiving a complaint, the department will review the named Internet website for online child care job postings. If a violation is found, a written notice of violation will be served to the owner, specifying the nature of the violation, the opportunity for a fair hearing, and potential fines for subsequent violations. The department will provide written notice of violations to the owner, who has 30 days to correct the violation or request a hearing. Evidence of compliance can be submitted, and fines of $1,000 per violation may be imposed for second and subsequent violations. Fines collected will go to the Child Health and Safety Fund."
