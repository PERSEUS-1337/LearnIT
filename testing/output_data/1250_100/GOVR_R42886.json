It oversees the transfer of radio frequencies to the commercial sector, with proceeds going to the U.S. Treasury. In 2013, the NTIA focused on supporting the innovation economy and promoting broadband infrastructure deployment. The NTIA is working towards promoting broadband infrastructure deployment and advocating for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet policymaking. They are also involved in identifying spectrum for commercial wireless use as part of President Obama's Wireless Initiative. Additionally, the NTIA administers grants programs, including the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), and is starting a $135 million grant program to help states plan for participation in a new nationwide initiative. The NTIA is launching a $135 million grant program to assist states in preparing for a new public safety broadband network. The program establishes FirstNet as an independent authority within the NTIA, funded through the Public Safety Trust Fund. FirstNet has access to $2 billion in advance from the U.S. Treasury and expects an additional $5 billion from auction revenues. The President's budget request for the NTIA in FY2014 was $52.1 million. In FY2011, the NTIA's budget increased by 4% to $41.6 million, with funding for the PTFP transferred to administrative expenses. The increase in funding for salaries and expenses was mainly due to broadband deployment costs. In FY2012, funding requests for grant programs totaled $32.3 million. For FY2013, $25.8 million was designated for broadband grant programs, primarily BTOP. In FY2014, $24.7 million was requested for broadband grant program oversight. NTIA also receives funding from spectrum management fees, with reimbursable funding estimated at $37.5 million for FY2014. The FY2014 budget request for NTIA includes $7.5 million for a new spectrum monitoring system program with staff increases. Funding of $1.25 million and five FTEs are requested for the Office of Spectrum Management for Wireless Broadband Access. Total FTEs for both funded and reimbursable programs are estimated at 309, compared to 302 in FY2013 and 257 in FY2012. The NTIA manages spectrum for federal agencies and collaborates with the FCC on spectrum access and policy. They work with the Department of State on international spectrum issues and participate in developing Internet policy. The NTIA also collaborates with NIST, FCC, and DHS on grants for building wireless networks. The NTIA, through its Office of Spectrum Management (OSM), develops plans and policies for effective spectrum use nationally and internationally. The OSM addresses federal government spectrum requirements, coordinates satellite networks, assigns frequencies to federal agencies, and certifies new radio communication systems. The Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) supports NTIA's role in advising on telecommunications policies. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) enhances U.S. companies' global competitiveness in information technology. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) works to enhance U.S. companies' global competitiveness in information technology and communications sectors by participating in international forums and promoting policies that open ICT markets and encourage competition. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) provides technical support to advance telecommunications and information infrastructure development. The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) administers grant programs to further technology deployment and national priorities. The Office of Public Safety Communications, created by the NTIA, focuses on public safety communication initiatives. The Office of Public Safety Communications, established by the NTIA in 2012, administers provisions of the Spectrum Act. Budget categories include salaries and expenses for Domestic and International Policies, Spectrum Management, Telecommunication Sciences Research, and Broadband Programs. Grant funding for the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program was terminated in FY2011. Grants in FY2010 supported broadcast and non-broadcast projects, with funds going to public radio and television stations for equipment replacement and expanding services to underserved communities. Grants also helped stations convert from analog to digital broadcasting, supporting the Emergency Alert system and Wireless Emergency Alerts. The Spectrum Act, part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, gives the NTIA responsibilities to support FirstNet in building a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. The NTIA also manages the Public Safety Trust Fund and oversees the State and Local Implementation Fund grant process through the Office of Public Safety Communications. The Office manages service-level agreements for FirstNet, an autonomous organization with broad powers. NTIA may have exceeded its role by setting its own requirements for FirstNet. Current funding practices hinder forward planning. The act re-establishes the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office. The act re-establishes the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to plan for next-generation systems (NG 9-1-1) and administer a grant program with $115 million in authorized funding. The ICO will provide matching grants for improvements in 911 emergency services and report on costs for NG 9-1-1 services. Additionally, the NTIA will ensure that auction revenues for the Public Safety Trust Fund are allocated to the Network Construction Fund for FirstNet's nationwide network. The NTIA is allocated funds for construction, maintenance, and grants for states to build radio access network links to FirstNet. The Public Safety Trust Fund has $1.908 billion available, with $1.902 billion for goods and services purchases. A State and Local Implementation Fund is established for grants to support planning and outreach activities. Expenditures from the fund include $300,000 for administrative costs in FY2012. Grants totaling over $116 million were awarded. Grants totaling over $116 million were awarded to 54 states and territories in FY2013 under the BTOP program. The Spectrum Act partly suspended funding to broadband projects for public safety to allow evaluation by the FirstNet board. FirstNet was granted the national license for public safety broadband, with lease agreements required for spectrum access. Negotiations on leasing agreements began in February 2013, with four BTOP grant recipients eligible to receive the balance of their grants. The Spectrum Act updated procedures for reallocating spectrum from federal to commercial use, requiring collaboration between NTIA and FCC to identify specific bands for release. The Spectrum Act outlines provisions for repurposing spectrum resources from federal to commercial use through auction or sharing, with a focus on exclusive, non-federal uses through competitive bidding. It establishes a Technical Panel within the NTIA to review federal agency transition plans, with members appointed by key government officials. The NTIA has published interpretations of the act's provisions, including requirements for dispute resolution. The Administration and Congress are working to increase radio frequency spectrum for mobile services like Internet access, especially for smart phones and tablets. Proposals include clearing federal users from designated frequencies for commercial use, sharing federal frequencies with specific commercial users, improving federal spectrum efficiency, and using emerging technologies for network management. The NTIA supports increasing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz and has produced a 10-year plan to identify bands of spectrum for commercial wireless broadband service. The NTIA prepared a \"Fast Track Evaluation\" recommending the availability of 15 MHz of spectrum between 1695 MHz and 1710 MHz, and 100 MHz within bands from 3550 MHz to 3650 MHz. Additionally, two 20 MHz bands within 4200-4400 MHz were suggested for possible repurposing at the World Radio Conference (WRC-2015). The WRC is a key forum for international spectrum negotiations. Federal spectrum decisions are made through the Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC), which includes representatives from the U.S. military and federal agencies. The NTIA is advised on spectrum policy by the Commerce Spectrum Advisory Committee (CSMAC). The NTIA studied federal spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, estimating an $18 billion cost to clear federal users. Recommendations included sharing frequencies between federal and commercial users, with some frequencies cleared for auction. The GAO testified on undeveloped spectrum sharing technology and policies at a House Committee hearing. The GAO identified options to encourage spectrum sharing, including spectrum usage fees, identifying more spectrum for unlicensed use, and improving regulatory processes. The Department of Defense offered to release frequencies in the 1755-1780 MHz band for sharing, estimating lower relocation costs if the band was shared. The NTIA endorsed the DOD proposal for releasing spectrum. The NTIA endorsed the DOD proposal for releasing frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz, but their cost estimates for relocating federal agencies were challenged in a congressional hearing. The GAO presented preliminary findings on DOD's reallocation costs for these frequencies, noting that the estimates partially met best practices. The NTIA leads interagency efforts to develop Internet policy, works with other governments and international organizations on relevant issues, and plays a role in the Internet Policy Task Force. It also oversees the Domain Name System and supports a multi-stakeholder approach for its coordination. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Boulder, CO, conducts research and engineering services for the NTIA. The NTIA's Institute for Telecommunication Sciences provides core research and engineering services to promote competition, new technology deployment, and efficient spectrum use. Activities for FY2014 include evaluating federal spectrum repurposing, overseeing FirstNet, and leading Internet policy formation. The NTIA's role as liaison may lead to overlapping responsibilities and duplication of effort across agencies. Rapid advances in communications technology have changed the NTIA's mission in areas such as spectrum policy. The NTIA's role in overseeing spectrum policy and communication policies may need to be reevaluated by the 113th Congress. Congress may consider transferring some of NTIA's shared obligations to its partners to focus on key economic growth policies. Oversight may include examining the efficacy of NTIA's spectrum management activities and its compliance with the Spectrum Act."
