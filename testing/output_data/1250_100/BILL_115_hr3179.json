    "content": "The Act is named the \"Transparency and Accountability for Business Standards Act\". It includes a requirement for cost-benefit analysis for certain prudential regulations. The appropriate Federal banking agency must provide a rationale and cost-benefit analysis before adopting a prudential regulation more stringent than an international standard. This includes assessing impacts on credit availability, market liquidity, institution competitiveness, employment, economic growth, and monetary policy execution. The appropriate Federal banking agency must publish a proposal to repeal or amend a superseded prudential regulation before implementing an international standard. If not, they must provide a rationale including a cost-benefit analysis. Before the enactment of this Act, each appropriate Federal banking agency must issue a report to Congress within 180 days regarding any prudential regulation that is more stringent than an international standard or has been superseded. Definitions for \"appropriate Federal banking agency\" and \"banking organization\" are provided in this section. The term \"corresponding international prudential standard\" refers to an international standard that serves as the basis for a prudential regulation. Prudential regulation encompasses rules related to capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements imposed on banking organizations. The term \"international prudential standard\" refers to standards adopted by international institutions like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board. These standards relate to capital, leverage, liquidity requirements, and minimum requirements on a banking organization's capital, debt, or liquid assets. The term \"superseded prudential regulation\" refers to regulations that address similar risks or achieve similar goals as international standards."
