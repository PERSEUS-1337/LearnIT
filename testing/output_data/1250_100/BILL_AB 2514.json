    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance is set at 5% of property tax allocated to the successor agency for a specific period, with a minimum threshold of $250,000 unless reduced by oversight board or agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller, with a minimum of $250,000 per fiscal year. This amount can be reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies to administrative costs regardless of payment source, except for costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The administrative cost allowance approved by the oversight board is the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. \"Designated local authority\" refers to a public entity formed under Section 34173. \"Enforceable obligation\" includes specific criteria. \"Enforceable obligation\" encompasses bonds, loans, and payments mandated by federal or state entities. Bonds must cover debt service, reserves, and other necessary payments. Loans must adhere to repayment schedules or mandatory terms. The 1990 Joint Powers Agreement and cooperation agreement confirm federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base, including member contributions and a state water contractor. Costs incurred for passthrough payments by the county auditor-controller and legally enforceable payments related to agency employees, such as pension payments and collective bargaining agreement obligations, are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. Layoff or termination costs for city employees who worked for the former redevelopment agency are also included. Employee obligations remain payable from property tax funds if the employee is transferred to the entity assuming housing functions. The successor agency must reimburse the housing entity for any employee obligation costs. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or settlements against the former redevelopment agency. Legally binding agreements or contracts can be terminated with approval from the oversight board, with compensation provided if necessary. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, shall be paid out of the administrative cost allowance starting January 1, 2016. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds are repayable. If not, the funds are considered a grant and not repayable. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. For the purposes of this part, enforceable obligations do not include agreements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former agency. Written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding prior obligations by June 27, 2011, may be deemed enforceable. Loan agreements within two years of the agency's creation may also be considered enforceable obligations. The redevelopment agency may have enforceable obligations, including agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements and repayment of loans from federal agencies. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas that were not properly authorized shall be void, except for housing-related contracts. Indebtedness obligations refer to financing instruments issued for redevelopment projects. Oversight boards are entities established under Section 34179. The Oversight board is established under Section 34179 and oversees recognized obligations listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The schedule outlines minimum payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations until June 30, 2016, and from July 1, 2016, onwards for each fiscal year. Taxing entities, including cities, counties, special districts, and school entities, receive passthrough payments and property tax distributions. Successor agencies replace former redevelopment agencies. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to property taxes, the Department of Finance, sponsoring entities, final judicial determinations, and housing entity administrative cost allowance from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency. If there are insufficient funds, the unpaid amount can be listed on subsequent payment schedules until fully paid, without a five-year time limit."
