The Council is composed of research managers from various agencies with expertise in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Non-Federal individuals can also serve as ex officio members. The Chairperson is elected by members for a two-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. Members are entitled to compensation for travel expenses. Interagency cooperation is emphasized.
