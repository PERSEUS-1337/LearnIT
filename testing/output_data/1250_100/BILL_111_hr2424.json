    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to the Federal Reserve. The Congress found that in August 2007, liquidity dried up in credit and securities markets, initially affecting financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed securities. This lack of access to credit spread globally, leading the Federal Reserve to establish a target range of 0 to 0.25 percent in response to the crisis. The Federal Reserve has responded to \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" multiple times since the financial crisis, providing assistance to nonmember institutions and purchasing debt obligations from government-sponsored enterprises. Additionally, joint programs with the Department of the Treasury were established to aid financial markets. Chairman Ben Bernanke affirmed commitment to transparency in Federal Reserve lending programs during a House of Representatives testimony on February 10, 2009. SEC. 3. REVIEWS OF SPECIAL FEDERAL RESERVE CREDIT FACILITIES. Section 714 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to allow the Comptroller General to conduct reviews of credit facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any Federal reserve bank, including onsite examinations when deemed necessary. This includes reviewing the establishment of credit facilities for providing temporary assistance to private institutions as the lender of last resort. The Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009 lists various credit facilities including the Money Market Investor Funding Facility, Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and others. The Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009 includes provisions for the Mortgage Backed Securities Purchase Program and the purchase of debt obligations from a Government Sponsored Enterprise. It also outlines the termination of authority after a 5-year period and requires a report on each review conducted by the Comptroller General to be submitted to Congress within 90 days. The Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009 includes provisions for recommendations for legislative or administrative action as determined by the Comptroller General. SEC. 4. ACCESS TO RECORDS. The Comptroller General shall have access to the officers, employees, contractors, and other agents and representatives of any agency or credit facility established by an agency at any reasonable time as requested. Copies of records may be made and retained by the Comptroller General. Unauthorized access to records is prohibited."
