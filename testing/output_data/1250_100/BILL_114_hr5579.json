    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Secure E-Waste Export and Recycling Act\" and includes export controls on electronic waste. The \"Secure E-Waste Export and Recycling Act\" defines electronic waste as used items containing electronic components, including computers, data center equipment, mobile computers, televisions, video display devices, and digital imaging devices. The \"Secure E-Waste Export and Recycling Act\" includes electronic items such as printers, copiers, facsimile machines, digital cameras, projectors, cellular phones, GPS devices, and other electronic items deemed necessary by the Secretary. The \"Secure E-Waste Export and Recycling Act\" exempts certain electronic waste items, including tested, working used electronics, low-risk counterfeit electronics, and recalled electronics. Tested, working used electronics are determined to be fully functional for their intended purpose. The term \"low-risk counterfeit electronics\" refers to electronic components that have been rendered unusable for their original purpose through destruction processes. The term \"recalled electronics\" refers to electronic items subject to a recall notice due to a defect in design or manufacture, as issued by relevant authorities. These items are then recycled in a reclamation process in a foreign country, meeting their laws. The term \"counterfeit good\" refers to any good with a counterfeit mark. The term \"feedstock\" refers to raw materials for an industrial process. A counterfeit military good is a product falsely labeled as meeting military specifications or intended for military use. A counterfeit mark is defined in section 2320 of title 18, United States Code. Export Administration Regulations refer to regulations for exports and reexports as defined in the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Administration Regulations prohibit the export or reexport of electronic waste, with exemptions for listed entities meeting certain requirements, including registration and filing export information. The regulations allow for the export of exempted electronic waste items under certain conditions, including providing information on the recipient country and consignee, ensuring compliance with export laws, and meeting export declaration requirements. The export of exempted electronic waste items requires documentation of registration, a signed declaration of compliance, a description of contents, testing methodologies for working equipment, consignee information, and written consent for low-risk counterfeit electronics if needed by the importing country. The Secretary may provide exceptions for exports or reexports of electronic components intended for personal use or to entities under the exporter's ownership. Recordkeeping requirements apply, and the section will take effect after a 1-year period. The Export Administration Regulations will be modified within 1 year of the enactment of this Act. Violations of this section will result in penalties under the Export Administration Regulations."
