    "content": "The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" improves veterans' benefits for former prisoners of war. The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" amends section 1112 of title 38, United States Code, by repealing the minimum period of internment for presumption of service connection for certain diseases and adding additional diseases presumed to be service connected. The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" amends section 1112 of title 38, United States Code, by adding new subparagraphs for heart disease, stroke, diabetes (type 2), and osteoporosis. It also grants the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to determine additional diseases warranting a presumption of service connection for prisoners of war based on medical and scientific evidence. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for a presumption of service connection for diseases in prisoners of war based on medical evidence. Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War and other scientific information will be considered. The association between a disease and being a prisoner of war will be deemed positive if credible evidence supports it. The Secretary receives recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War regarding establishing a presumption of service connection for diseases. If warranted, proposed regulations will be issued within 60 days. If not warranted, a notice will be published with an explanation. If a disease is already included in regulations, the presumption may be removed within 60 days. The Secretary shall issue final regulations within 90 days of proposing them. If a disease is removed from regulations, veterans and survivors will still receive compensation. The Secretary will consult with the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War. The title is amended to include a new provision."
