The Office of Personnel Management will study and submit a report to Congress on the need for a separate pay system for Federal law enforcement officers. If deemed appropriate, a demonstration project will be implemented to assess the benefits of this system within 12 months. The Office of Personnel Management will conduct a demonstration project to evaluate a separate pay system for Federal law enforcement officers. The project must comply with relevant provisions of title 5, United States Code, and a report with recommendations must be submitted to Congress before the project's termination date. The term \"Federal law enforcement officer\" is defined as per sections 8331 or 8401 of title 5, United States Code. The Office of Personnel Management will submit a report to Congress on the definition of a Federal law enforcement officer for pay and benefits under title 5, United States Code.
