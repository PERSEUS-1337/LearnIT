The term \"historic building or structure\" refers to those listed on the National Register of Historic Places or within designated historic districts. The Secretary mentioned is the Secretary of the Interior. Grants are provided for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at historically women's public colleges or universities. The Secretary awards grants to historically women's public colleges or universities for preserving and restoring historic buildings. Grants are funded through the National Historic Preservation Act for fiscal years 2002-2006. Grantees must agree to conditions including no alterations without Secretary's approval and allowing public access for educational purposes. Matching requirements apply to buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Secretary may provide funds for grants related to historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks, or within historic districts. Grantees must match 50% of the program costs with non-Federal funds. In-kind contributions can also count towards the non-Federal share. Funding is capped at $16,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006. For fiscal year 2002, $2,000,000 is allocated for grants under subsection (a) to specific universities in different states. For fiscal year 2002, $2,000,000 is allocated for grants to universities in different states. If less than $16,000,000 is available, the amount for each institution listed will be reduced. Funds for fiscal years 2003-2006 will be distributed to eligible grantees on a uniform basis. The Secretary will promulgate necessary regulations to carry out this Act."
