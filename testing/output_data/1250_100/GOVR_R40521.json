    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education and related services for children with disabilities. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all eligible children, identify and evaluate children with disabilities, create individual education programs (IEPs) for each child, and involve parents in the planning process. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures children with disabilities receive special education services and mandates inclusion in general education settings whenever possible. It provides procedural safeguards, including due process hearings and appeals, and was enacted in 1975 to address the education rights of children with disabilities. IDEA has undergone multiple reauthorizations, with the most recent in 2004. Currently, Congress is considering potential issues for the next reauthorization. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical and requires special education and related services. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court determined that a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD met the IDEA criteria for serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments. In court decisions, children with disabilities such as ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome were found to be covered by IDEA even if their educational performance was not significantly impacted. The need for special education services was emphasized in these cases. In court decisions, children with disabilities such as ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome were found to be covered by IDEA even if their educational performance was not significantly impacted. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that a child with schizophrenia was not disabled because it did not affect her school performance. The Ninth Circuit held that a child with ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder was not eligible for IDEA services. The Fifth Circuit also found no adverse educational effect from a child's ADHD. The Second Circuit found that a child with dysthymic disorder did not meet the requirements for seriously emotionally disturbed under IDEA regulations. It was also noted that even if the child qualified, there was insufficient evidence of adverse educational performance. IDEA mandates that states have policies in place to identify, locate, and evaluate children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a student who exhibited concerning behavior could lead to a due process complaint. The Supreme Court is considering a case involving a parent alleging negligence by school officials for failing to provide an educational program for their child with a disability. The issue is whether due process suits are allowed for negligence or only intentional decisions. The core requirement of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established the requirements of FAPE under IDEA, stating that children with disabilities must be provided with personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. This instruction should be at public expense, meet state educational standards, and approximate grade levels used in regular education. The Supreme Court established in the Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley case in 1982 that children with disabilities must receive personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. The child's Individualized Education Program (IEP) should align with state educational standards and grade levels, and should enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade when mainstreamed. The FAPE requirement is met as long as the child is progressing and making measurable gains, without the states being obligated to maximize each child's potential. The responsibility for education lies with state and local educational agencies, with courts cautioned against imposing their views on educational methods. The Supreme Court's decision in Rowley established that children with disabilities must receive personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. The Court did not establish a specific test for determining educational benefits, but emphasized the importance of access to education. Lower courts have varied in their interpretation of Rowley, with some courts supporting schools' IEPs even if educational progress is minimal. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the court held that an IEP was adequate despite low reading proficiency scores. Some courts interpret the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) differently, with some emphasizing the provision of educational services over medical services. Courts like the Third Circuit in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 and the Fifth Circuit in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. have held that an Individualized Education Program (IEP) must provide more than minimal educational benefit and must be meaningful. The Cypress-Fairbanks court identified four factors to determine if an IEP meets this standard. The courts have different interpretations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), with some focusing on educational services. In Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, improved SAT scores and excellent grades were considered as evidence of receiving a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) under IDEA. However, in Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit emphasized that children with above-average intelligence require more than a negligible benefit. Procedural violations must impact the child's substantive rights to constitute a violation of FAPE. For example, services mandated by an IEP should be implemented promptly after development. Inaccessible facilities may not necessarily violate FAPE. The Ninth Circuit found that failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability and unilaterally scheduling an IEP meeting without parental agreement can constitute a denial of FAPE. The interpretation of \"educational standards\" has evolved, leading to confusion in applying the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current controversies. The term \"educational standards\" now refers to specific content-based standards outlining what a child should know and be able to do in their education. Recent amendments to IDEA have emphasized standards-based education, requiring IEPs to include present levels of performance, measurable goals, and access to the general curriculum. This shift aligns with the focus on high expectations and access to the general curriculum for children with disabilities. The education movement, reflected in IDEA and NCLBA, has raised questions about the current application of Rowley. Parents of students with disabilities argue that FAPE requirements have been affected by NCLBA. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA require specially designed instruction based on peer-reviewed research. This requirement may conflict with Rowley's educational benefit standard. The court in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District rejected the argument that an IEP must be based on peer-reviewed research, stating that an \"eclectic approach\" was sufficient under IDEA. The court emphasized that decisions must meet IDEA requirements, not necessarily be the best decision. IDEA mandates an Individualized Education Team to create an IEP with specific components like academic goals and services. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a key component of IDEA, ensuring that children with disabilities receive educational benefits. Courts use the Rowley two-part inquiry to determine compliance with IDEA and the adequacy of an IEP. Flaws in an IEP may not violate IDEA if they do not compromise the child's right to education or deprive them of benefits, as seen in court cases like Joshua Renollett and Cabouli v. Chappaqua Central School District. The adequacy of the IEP, including the child's recent social progress, indicated that the child would likely make educational progress under the IEP. The lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not necessarily invalidate it. Courts have ruled that procedural violations that do not harm the student substantively are not a violation of IDEA. However, an IEP that does not provide educational benefits violates IDEA, as seen in cases like A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board and M.L. v. Federal Way School District. In M.L. v. Federal Way School District, the Ninth Circuit found that excluding a regular education teacher from the IEP team denied FAPE. However, in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA did not mandate the child's current special education teacher's participation. Courts have limited parental control over IEP content, allowing schools to conduct independent medical evaluations without consent. In Lessard and Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District, the First Circuit ruled that an incomplete IEP was not procedurally deficient. In the IEP context, courts have found in favor of parents in cases where there was a lack of prior notice to proposed IEP changes, failure to inform parents of their due process rights, and determining a child's placement before the IEP meeting. IDEA's requirement of a free appropriate public education includes special education and related services like transportation and supportive services. Related services under IDEA include a range of support services such as speech-language pathology, audiology, psychological services, therapy, social work, and medical services for diagnostic purposes. Two Supreme Court cases have addressed the provision of medical services, with one ruling in favor of a child requiring clean intermittent catheterization. The concept of related services aims to assist children with disabilities in benefiting from special education. The Court ruled that services for a child's medical and educational needs must be provided under IDEA if the child has a disability requiring special education, the service is necessary for the child to benefit from special education, and can be provided by a qualified non-physician. The case of Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. involved a paralyzed child who needed extensive medical services, but the school denied the parents' request for these services. The Court rejected the school's proposed test for related services under IDEA, stating that the medical services exclusion only applies to physician or hospital services. The 2004 reauthorization established risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds to assist LEAs serving these children. Recent IDEA cases have emphasized the federal court's discretion in defining necessary services for children with disabilities to benefit from special education. IDEA requires children with disabilities to be educated with non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. Recent court decisions use a two-pronged approach to determine if an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment. The first prong considers if education in a regular classroom with supplementary services is feasible, while the second prong assesses if the school has mainstreamed the child adequately. Factors include the school's efforts to accommodate the child and the educational benefits in a regular classroom. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the impact of a child with disabilities on other students in a regular classroom, noting disruptive behaviors such as loud vocalizations, removal of shoes and socks, and difficulty toileting. The court upheld the decision that the child could not be satisfactorily educated full time in a regular classroom. P.L. 94-142, the original version of IDEA, provided grants to states for education of children with disabilities and outlined specific requirements for receiving federal funds, including the \"stay put\" provision in case of disputes between schools and parents. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA ensures that children with disabilities remain in their current educational placement during disputes. The Supreme Court case of Honig v. Doe highlighted the importance of this provision in preventing schools from unilaterally expelling disabled students. The Supreme Court case of Honig v. Doe established the school's right to seek judicial relief, known as a Honig injunction, in cases where a student poses a threat to safety. Congress later amended IDEA to allow schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting if they bring a firearm, weapon, or drugs to school. The 2004 reauthorization expanded the stay put provision to include situations where a student inflicts serious bodily injury at school. Courts have debated if the provision applies during a transition from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The Third Circuit ruled in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit that the provision requires continued services until disputes are resolved, while the Eleventh Circuit disagreed in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County. The Eleventh Circuit ruled in Sammons v. Polk County School Board that the stay put provision does not apply to a request for mediation under the IDEA regulations. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit determined that a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents cannot use the stay put provision to continue private school placement. Similarly, in E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court held that the stay put provision applies to the placement recommended by the IEP team. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District that the stay put provision applies throughout the appeals process. In N.D. v. State of Hawaii, the court found that the stay put provision does not cover system-wide changes in public schools. The House passed the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act\" in response to increased congressional interest in the use of seclusion and restraints. The House passed H.R. 4247, the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act,\" addressing the use of seclusion and restraints for children with disabilities under IDEA. The Department of Education clarified that while IDEA promotes positive behavioral interventions, it does not outright prohibit the use of restraints. State laws may dictate the use of restraints, but they must align with the child's IEP and consider positive behavioral supports. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed this issue. The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA. Despite the lack of specific language in IDEA regarding the use of restraints and seclusion, cases have been brought alleging that their use violates a child's right to a free appropriate public education. Generally, courts have not found violations of IDEA where the seclusion or restraint was deemed necessary to keep the child from hurting himself or others, or where the child was progressing academically and the school had tailored the child's IEP to address behavioral issues. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, parents challenged the use of seclusion and restraint procedures on their child, leading to her withdrawal from the school. The Eighth Circuit ruled that dissatisfaction with education must be addressed through IDEA due process procedures while the child is still in the school district. IDEA has also been used by parents to challenge a New York State regulation banning \"aversive interventions\" due to concerns about IEP revisions without parental consent. The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against the regulation on aversive therapies, finding it informed and rational. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE under IDEA. Courts have differing views on tying harassment claims to IDEA and exhaustion of administrative remedies under ADA and Section 504. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act may lead to retaliation actions for advocating violations of IDEA. Section 615 of IDEA outlines procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including provisions for a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Parents or schools can file a due process complaint within two years of knowing about the violation. The 2004 reauthorization allows schools to also file complaints, leading to potential district court suits after an administrative decision. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added a resolution session requirement before due process hearings, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Mediation provisions were added in the 1997 reauthorization and retained in current law, with judicial enforcement of agreements. Court decisions have addressed issues like confidentiality of resolution session discussions and the inclusion of school board attorneys. Several court decisions have addressed the inclusion of school board attorneys in settlement discussions and the enforceability of mediation agreements in federal court. The courts have generally limited judicial enforcement to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation, as seen in cases like Amy S. v. Danbury and Ballard v. Philadelphia. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination that a due process complaint did not meet IDEA's pleading requirements. The court quoted from the Senate report stating that the determination of complaint notice adequacy should be made on the face of the complaint, with no hearing or appeal allowed. The court found it troubling that a state official could summarily dismiss a complaint based on federal law without proper review. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action without prejudice. Courts have ruled that LEAs cannot bring actions against SEAs for IDEA noncompliance. IDEA limits complaints to matters related to child identification, evaluation, or placement. LEAs have no private right of action under IDEA to litigate issues not raised by parents. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court ruled that parents have the right to bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights regarding their child's education. The Court emphasized that IDEA grants parents independent rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, ensuring children with disabilities and their parents are protected. This interpretation considers the entire statutory scheme of IDEA. The Supreme Court ruled in Winkelman v. Parma City School District that parents have the right to bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights regarding their child's education. The Court emphasized that IDEA grants parents independent rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, ensuring children with disabilities and their parents are protected. These provisions support the finding that parents of a child with a disability have a particular and personal interest in the goals of IDEA, including both procedural and substantive rights. Justice Kennedy noted that IDEA does not differentiate between the rights accorded to children and parents, and concerns about increased costs to states were not sufficient to argue that IDEA failed to provide clear notice before imposing new conditions or obligations. Additionally, IDEA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to prevailing parties. Kennedy observed that IDEA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing educational agency when a parent has brought an action for an \"improper purpose.\" The Supreme Court's emphasis on a parent's rights has led to the conclusion that a non-attorney parent can assert their own claims. Parents have personal rights to enforce FAPE and can survive attempts to dismiss their claims. However, parents cannot use their rights to circumvent existing consent decrees. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, parents' claims were dismissed as not personal to them. Parental rights under Winkelman have been extended to cases under Section 504. In D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District, the court found that Winkelman's parental rights do not apply to Section 504 and the ADA. Blanchard v. Morton School District raised the issue of recovering damages under IDEA, with the Ninth Circuit stating that money damages are not available for a child with a disability. Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City addressed the rights of a noncustodial parent under IDEA. The Fuentes court emphasized that a noncustodial biological parent lacks legal authority to make educational decisions for the child. IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA are federal statutes addressing the education rights of individuals with disabilities, with each playing a significant role in ensuring equal access to education. IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides additional programs for children with disabilities, while Section 504 and the ADA, enacted in 1973 and 1990 respectively, prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA has broader coverage than Section 504, not tied to federal funds. Courts have examined the interaction of these statutes, noting differences in coverage. IDEA ensures FAPE with due process requirements, including impartial hearings. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing was clarified in the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast. In the case of Schaffer v. Weast, the Supreme Court clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments that the burden should be on the school system, noting that parents have rights to information and safeguards under IDEA. Under IDEA, parents have rights to information and safeguards, including the right to an independent educational evaluation, details about options considered by the school district, disclosure of evaluations and recommendations, and the possibility of receiving attorneys' fees if they prevail. The issue of services required for children with disabilities in private schools and who pays for them has been controversial. Current law allows for children with disabilities to be placed in private schools by the LEA or SEA, with the full cost covered by them. If parents unilaterally place their child in a private school, the cost is not covered unless certain findings are made. IDEA mandates some services for children in private schools, even if they are unilaterally placed there. The IDEA allows for reimbursement of private school placement costs if a child with a disability is enrolled without consent from the public agency. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed tuition reimbursement for parents who place their child in a private school without prior special education from the public school. In a 2007 decision, the Supreme Court allowed private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability, even if the child had never received special education services from the public school. This decision did not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unsettled. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that reimbursement for private special education services is authorized when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of prior special education services. Recent lower court decisions have determined that as long as a child is making educational progress with an IEP provided by the public school, they are not entitled to a private school placement. This was exemplified in a case where parents were denied tuition reimbursement for a private school placement because the child's IEP was deemed adequate. The courts have also applied similar standards when parents want to place their child in a different private school. Additionally, if a private school does not meet the child's educational needs, reimbursement may not be required. Simply having a high percentage of children with disabilities in a private school does not automatically make it an appropriate placement. Private school tuition reimbursement may be barred if parents do not notify the LEA of issues with their child's IDEA services or if they act unreasonably towards the school. However, reimbursement may still be possible if the child has not received special education services before. If a school district fails to provide FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education aims to make up for past inadequate programs and is based on the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts. Courts have differed in how compensatory education is awarded for violations of FAPE. Some courts grant compensatory education for the same amount of time services were withheld, while others focus on providing appropriate education under IDEA. The IEP for children receiving compensatory education may require more services than a general IEP to compensate for the denial of appropriate education. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for deprivation of rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States, but IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted first. The IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted before filing a \u00a71983 action. Courts have debated the application of damages for pain and suffering under IDEA. Some courts allow damages, while others do not. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson limited remedies for prevailing parties under IDEA to those in the statute, stating that using other statutes for attorneys' fees would be inconsistent with Congress' scheme. Congress responded by enacting the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to address this issue. The Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986 provided for attorneys' fees under IDEA, with amendments in 1997 and 2004. The 2004 reauthorization allowed attorneys' fees for the state or local educational agency against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The ADA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to prevailing parties, rejecting the \"catalyst theory\" for fees. The Court rejected the theory that attorneys' fees are available without a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. Buckhannon has been consistently applied to attorneys' fees provision in IDEA, with fees awarded in various situations such as prevailing in administrative or judicial proceedings. Fees have been given for misclassification of a child's disability but not for cases where the child's disability under IDEA has not been determined. Judicial approval is required for attorneys' fees obtained through a settlement agreement. Attorneys' fees are not awarded for voluntary settlements or private agreements not judicially approved. In Drennan v. Pulaski County Special School District, fees were denied for not fulfilling court-ordered duties. Representation by consultants or parent-attorneys is not eligible for fees, but relatives like grandparents may receive them. Courts have discretion in awarding fees based on the party's success, sometimes awarding less than requested. Refusal of a settlement offer may result in denied or reduced fees. The Fifth Circuit has ruled that refusal to attend a meeting when a settlement has not been offered does not justify reducing the award. A fee cap on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia has been in place since FY1999. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party if the parent's complaint is found to be frivolous or unreasonable. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit allowed attorneys' fees to be awarded to the LEA against a lawyer. The Fifth Circuit allowed attorneys' fees to be awarded to the LEA against a lawyer who used stonewalling tactics. The Sixth Circuit found that fee-shifting provision did not apply to private schools. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that lawyers should not be discouraged from taking on meritorious IDEA cases. The courts have examined whether the LEA was the prevailing party in cases like El Paso Independent School District v. Richard R and District of Columbia v. Straus. In District of Columbia v. Straus, the D.C. Court of Appeals did not award fees to the school district as they were not considered a prevailing party. The court highlighted concerns that if the district was deemed prevailing, it could ignore legal obligations until sued by parents. Some lower courts have interpreted IDEA's language on attorneys' fees to potentially include expert witness fees for prevailing parents. In Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, parents argued that costs could cover expert witness fees. The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Justice Alito, held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees they have paid to experts. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 were introduced in the 112th Congress to amend IDEA to include the fees of expert witnesses. The term 'attorneys' fees' under IDEA includes expert witness fees and necessary test costs for case preparation. IDEA offers dispute resolution through due process procedures and state complaint resolution. The Department of Education monitors IDEA implementation. P & A's advocate for individuals with disabilities through class action lawsuits for systemic violations. Class action lawsuits have targeted systemic violations of rights, including cases involving special education students and access to student records."
