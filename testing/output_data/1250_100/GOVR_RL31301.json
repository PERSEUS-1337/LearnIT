    "content": "The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7, H.J.Res. 2) signed into law by the President includes $74.25 billion in funding for USDA and related agencies, with $17.545 billion for discretionary programs. Additionally, $3.1 billion in supplemental disaster assistance is provided for farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters in 2001 or 2002. USDA, with approximately 100,000 employees, carries out various responsibilities beyond agriculture. In FY2002, USDA gross outlays were $79.95 billion, with food and nutrition programs accounting for the largest portion at $37.5 billion. In FY2002, USDA spending totaled $79.95 billion, with the largest portion allocated to food and nutrition programs. The second largest mission area was farm and foreign agricultural services, accounting for $22.9 billion. Other areas of spending included natural resource and environment programs, rural development, research and education, marketing and regulatory activities, and meat programs. In FY2002, USDA spending totaled $79.95 billion, with the largest portion allocated to food and nutrition programs. Other areas of spending included farm commodity price and income support programs, federal crop insurance program, agricultural conservation and trade programs, and meat and poultry inspection. Approximately three-fourths of total spending within the U.S. Department of Agriculture is classified as mandatory, with programs like food stamp and child nutrition programs funded through annual appropriations. The USDA budget consists of mandatory and discretionary programs. Mandatory programs include food and nutrition programs, farm commodity support, crop insurance, conservation, and trade programs. Discretionary programs are funded through annual appropriations acts and include Forest Service programs, rural development, research, agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat and poultry inspection, and food marketing. Funding for USDA discretionary programs (excluding the Forest Service) is provided by the annual agriculture appropriations act. Funding for Forest Service programs is included in the annual Interior appropriations act. The House Appropriations Committee oversees annual appropriations for USDA, FDA, and CFTC, excluding mandatory emergency supplemental appropriations. Mandatory programs have set eligibility rules and benefit formulas, while discretionary programs are controlled by annual appropriations acts. The Administration's budget request for FY2003 was released on February 4, 2002. The Bush Administration released its budget request for FY2003 on February 4, 2002, requesting $74.062 billion for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies. This amount is $814 million higher than the FY2002 enacted appropriation. The requested $17.421 billion for discretionary accounts is $1.145 billion above the total FY2002 discretionary appropriation. The increase in discretionary spending includes a legislative proposal for federal agencies to assume the full cost of accruing employee pensions and retiree health benefits starting in FY2003. The 107th Congress did not pass H.R. 5263 or S. 2801 for FY2003 appropriations for USDA. The 108th Congress considered an omnibus bill for USDA appropriations. The House completed markups for the bill totaling $74.306 billion, with $17.601 billion for discretionary programs and $56.705 billion for mandatory programs. The House bill for FY2003 appropriations included $17.601 billion for discretionary programs, $1.325 billion higher than FY2002. The Senate adopted an omnibus appropriations measure for USDA, including the full-text of outstanding regular bills. Until the bill was enacted, USDA spending was governed by continuing resolutions. The Senate reported the FY2003 agriculture appropriations bill (S. 2801) with total funding of $74.66 billion, $1 billion above the FY2002 enacted level. The 107th Congress adjourned without completing action on S. 2801, which was later combined with other appropriations bills into an omnibus package (H.J.Res. 2) adopted in January 2003. Funding levels for USDA in H.J.Res. 2 were close to those in S. 2801, with additional amendments providing $3.1 billion. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (H.J.Res. 2) provided $3.1 billion in farm economic and disaster assistance, along with $500 million in emergency famine relief for Africa. The bill was adopted by the House and Senate in February 2003, with the President signing it into law as P.L. 108-7. The total budget authority for USDA and related agencies in P.L. 108-7 was $74.25 billion, with $17.55 billion for discretionary programs and $56.70 billion for mandatory programs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $17.55 billion for discretionary programs and $56.70 billion for mandatory programs. The discretionary appropriation was slightly lower than the House-reported level but higher than the enacted FY2002 level. The bill also included $3.1 billion in disaster assistance offset by reductions in a mandatory conservation program. Additionally, there was a 0.65% across-the-board rescission in almost all discretionary programs. The report tracks congressional action on FY2003 agriculture appropriations, comparing various bills and funding levels for USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. Most spending for USDA's mandatory programs is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation, which can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. These funds support farm commodity price and income support activities, agricultural conservation, and trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a key funding source for various agricultural programs, including emergency supplemental spending for farm disaster payments and market loss payments. The CCC must repay funds borrowed from the Treasury, but its losses are replenished through congressional appropriations to maintain its borrowing authority. In recent years, the CCC has received an indefinite appropriation to cover funding needs for previous and current year losses. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has received indefinite appropriations in recent years to cover losses and maintain borrowing authority. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act concurred with the Administration's request for an estimated $16.285 billion for the CCC. Additionally, a separate supplemental appropriation of $3.1 billion was provided for farm disaster assistance. The Senate-passed version of the measure (H.J.Res. 2) provided a similar amount of disaster assistance as in P.L. 108-7. The cost of the package is offset by a spending limitation on the Conservation Security Program. The major provisions include Crop Disaster Assistance, which allows eligible producers to receive payments for crop losses exceeding 35% in 2001 or 2002. The Crop Disaster Assistance program provides payments to producers for crop losses exceeding 35% in 2001 or 2002. Producers must choose between a 2001 or 2002 payment, with limits on the amount to prevent exceeding 95% of the crop's value. Livestock Assistance offers $250 million for forage or feed losses due to natural disasters. The Livestock Assistance Program (LAP) provides assistance for forage or feed losses caused by natural disasters in disaster-declared counties. Producers can choose between 2001 or 2002 losses. The program also removes date restrictions for eligibility for the Livestock Compensation Program (LCP), with an estimated cost of $100 million. Additionally, the omnibus act provides various forms of assistance to commodities, including disaster payments to sugar beet producers, payments to sugarcane producers and processors for hurricane losses, and compensation for tobacco producers. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The program is funded through the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, which covers expenses such as premium subsidies and indemnity payments. The FY2003 appropriation for RMA salaries and expenses is $70.708 million. The FY2003 appropriation for RMA salaries and expenses is $70.708 million, which is slightly below the House-reported level. The Administration requested \"such sums as are necessary\" for mandatory expenses of the crop insurance program, estimating an FY2003 appropriation of $2.89 billion. This request was virtually equal to the FY2002 estimate. The FY2003 budget for the crop insurance program was $2.89 billion, similar to the FY2002 estimate. Legislative enhancements in 2000 increased farmer participation, leading to concerns about windfall profits for private insurance companies. The FY2003 budget proposal included a plan to limit underwriting gains for private companies, but no legislative action has been taken yet. Senate report language directed USDA to follow current procedures before making any risk-sharing changes. For more information on crop insurance, refer to CRS Report RL30739. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 (P.L.106-224) funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The USDA's Farm Service Agency administers various farmer programs, including commodity support, farm loan programs, and food assistance. The FSA Salaries and Expenses account, funded by appropriations and transfers, received $976.7 million in FY2003 from the omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7). Additionally, FSA can access up to an extra $70 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Farm Service Agency received $976.7 million in FY2003 from the omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) and can access an additional $70 million for administrative costs. The requested FY2003 appropriation for FSA salaries and expenses was $993.6 million, with $50 million in new mandatory funding for new farm bill programs. The omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $228.3 million for FSA farm loan programs, which serve as a lender of last resort for family farmers. The funds are used for direct farm loans, loan guarantees, and subsidies to help farmers with operating expenses and recover from natural disasters. The omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $228.3 million for FSA farm loan programs, supporting $3.937 billion in total direct and guaranteed farm loans for FY2003. This funding level allows FSA to offer nearly double the amount of direct operating loans compared to the previous year. Additionally, supplemental funding has been provided in recent years to address low farm commodity prices, which have hindered farmers' ability to secure commercial loans. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides funding for USDA international activities, including food aid programs, market development, export subsidies, and export credit guarantees. The program level for USDA's international activities was about $6.1 billion in FY2003, reflecting increased spending for food aid. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers these programs, including P.L. 480 Food for Peace. The administration of P.L. 480 Food for Peace is shared between USDA and USAID. USDA handles Title I, providing loans to developing countries for U.S. food purchases, while USAID manages Title II and Title III for commodity donations and bilateral food grants. P.L. 108-7 allocates $1.477 billion for USDA's international activities, with $1.2 billion authorized for humanitarian commodity donations. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act includes $1.2 billion for humanitarian commodity donations under P.L. 480 Title II, with an additional $250 million for emergency relief activities. The total for appropriated international programs is $344 million greater than enacted for FY2002, with most of the increase going to humanitarian food donations in response to urgent food needs in various countries. The increase in food aid appropriations is due to estimated global food needs and the Administration's decision to phase out food aid based on commodity surpluses. The FY2003 budget proposal recommended shifting food aid programs to USAID, reducing CCC funding for Section 416(b) commodity donations, and excluding CCC funding for Food for Progress. The Administration proposed increasing P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations to compensate for the phase-out of Section 416(b) donations. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized the Food for Progress program with continued reliance on CCC funding, complicating the Administration's efforts. The Administration's efforts to phase out CCC-funded food aid programs were complicated by the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 108-7), which required a minimum volume of commodities and expanded agreements to include PVOs and intergovernmental organizations. The use of commodity surpluses for U.S. food aid has faced criticism from the European Union and other countries for potentially circumventing WTO export subsidy reduction commitments. This issue is being pursued in multilateral trade negotiations. The U.S. is phasing out CCC-funded food aid programs, facing criticism for potentially circumventing WTO export subsidy reduction commitments. The President's budget assumes $118 million for programming under Section 416(b) in FY2003, mostly surplus nonfat dry milk. Other USDA international programs are funded through CCC borrowing authority, including $4.225 billion of CCC export credit guarantees for U.S. agricultural exports. The actual export value of credit guarantees in FY2003 will depend on market conditions. U.S. export credit programs have also been raised as an issue in multilateral trade negotiations. The U.S. export credit programs have been a point of contention in WTO agricultural trade negotiations, with the EU and other trading partners claiming that it gives the U.S. an unfair advantage. Negotiations in the OECD did not succeed, and any changes to the program would face strong congressional support. Additionally, CCC-funded programs assist in developing overseas markets for U.S. agricultural products, with $110 million allocated for the Market Access Program and $34 million for the Foreign Market Development Program. The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) funding is limited to $28 million, resulting in savings of $450 million from the authorized level. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is anticipated to receive $57 million, while the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED) has $100 million allocated for FY2002, with additional funding in subsequent years. The International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED) began as a pilot project during the Clinton Administration, funded by $300 million in CCC funds and commodities. The Administration planned to expend $100 million of CCC funds on IFED in FY2003. Conservation spending combines discretionary spending of over $1 billion in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) and mandatory funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation, estimated at almost $3.0 billion. Funding for the Forest Service is provided in the annual Interior appropriations bill. The mandatory conservation spending is estimated at almost $3.0 billion, with $1 billion authorized by the 2002 farm bill. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.028 billion for discretionary conservation programs within USDA. The difference between congressional levels and the Administration request includes funding for the Emergency Conservation Program. The FY2003 enacted level for discretionary conservation programs is $29 million lower than the FY2002 appropriation. The largest program, Conservation Operations (CO), received $825 million in FY2003, less than the Administration's request of $841 million. The increase in funding would have supported technical assistance for animal feeding operations to comply with clean water regulations. The law identified 114 earmarks for CO with a total cost exceeding $110 million. The appropriations bills in previous years included numerous earmarks, with S. 2801 containing 83 earmarks totaling about $90 million. The largest earmark, $21.5 million, is for the grazing lands conservation initiative. P.L. 108-7 allocated $110 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $11.2 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning, and $30 million for Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The Administration proposed no appropriation for these programs in FY2003, instead requesting $110 million for Emergency Watershed Protection. The Administration proposed $110 million for Emergency Watershed Protection, but the House recommended funding for other programs instead. The Senate recommended funding for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, Watershed Surveys and Planning, and Watershed Rehabilitation. P.L. 108-7 includes provisions limiting spending for technical assistance. P.L. 108-7 limits expenditures for technical assistance to $45.5 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and $1 million for protecting threatened species. The act provides $51 million for the Resource Conservation and Development Program, slightly more than the Administration's request. No funding is allocated for the Emergency Conservation Program or the Forestry Incentive Program. The 2002 farm bill eliminated NRCS technical assistance funding, leading to a dispute over funding limits for mandatory programs. The Administration proposed a new farm bill technical assistance line item at $333 million in FY2003, but Congress rejected it. Section 213 of P.L. 108-7 prohibits the use of discretionary funds for mandatory conservation programs. The Administration's FY2003 request did not include reauthorizations or increases for mandatory conservation programs, except for level funding for EQIP at $200 million. Most other programs had reached their ceilings or were unfunded due to previous legislation. The $3.1 billion in agricultural disaster assistance in P.L. 108-7 limited spending on the new CSP, which aims to pay farmers for conservation practices on productive land. The limitation in P.L. 108-7 prohibits funding in FY2003 and limits total ten-year funding to $3.773 billion. The bill includes provisions limiting or prohibiting funding for certain conservation programs, such as the Wetlands Reserve Program and EQIP. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program is also affected, with $45 million in mandatory funds prohibited for use in FY2003. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act does not address the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which pays farmers to retire environmentally sensitive land. USDA reported 35.1 million acres enrolled in the CRP, nearing its ceiling of 39.2 million acres. The budget allocates $1.856 billion for existing and new contracts. Other programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program and EQIP will see significant growth as reauthorized by the 2002 farm bill. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $2.506 billion for USDA's research, education, and economics agencies, exceeding the Senate-passed bill and House-reported bill. The final law is $61 million above the FY2002 enacted level. USDA's REE function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, and Economic Research Service. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.172 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.053 billion supporting research programs and $119.5 million for modernizing facilities. The funding for ARS in FY2003 is $64 million less compared to FY2002, including supplemental funding. P.L. 108-7 provides level funding for ARS research and an increase in funds for facilities construction compared to previous measures. The Administration requested $971.4 million for ARS research and $16.6 million for construction projects in FY2003. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.172 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.053 billion supporting research programs and $119.5 million for modernizing facilities. Congress adopted language to continue all ARS research projects recommended for termination. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized the ARS study, and additional appropriations were authorized for bioterrorism-related research facilities in Plum Island, NY and Ames, IA. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act authorized $190 million for research on bioterrorism prevention, preparedness, and response. P.L. 108-7 provided $1.125 billion for research and extension programs at land grant colleges of agriculture, with a $97 million increase over FY2002. This included funding for core research and extension programs at 1862 land grant institutions. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act authorized $190 million for bioterrorism research. P.L. 108-7 allocated $1.125 billion for research and extension programs at land grant colleges, including funding for core research and extension programs at 1862 and 1890 institutions. Special Research grants received $112.3 million, higher than the initial proposals. Additional earmarked grants under the \"Federal Administration\" portion of the CSREES budget received $30 million. The conferees agreed to provide $167.1 million for the National Research Initiative Competitive Research Grants program, compared to lower amounts in previous bills and the FY2002 budget. The FY2003 budget request proposed doubling the amount to $240 million. The conference report also blocks the expenditure of $120 million in mandatory funds for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The 2002 farm bill reauthorizes the Initiative and gradually increases its authorized funding. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 provides authority for security improvements at land grant college facilities and on-farm biosecurity education programs, but the FY2003 omnibus appropriations act contains no appropriations under this authority. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides funding for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). ERS receives $69.1 million, slightly higher than the Senate-passed amount but lower than the House-reported bill and budget request. NASS receives $139.4 million, close to the Senate-passed amount and higher than the House-reported level. The act also allocates $41.3 million of the NASS appropriation for the 2002 Census of Agriculture. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for inspecting meat, poultry, and processed egg products for safety and labeling compliance. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $759.8 million for FSIS, higher than previous funding levels. An additional $101 million in user fee income is allocated for inspection activities. $5 million is designated for hiring personnel to enforce the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The act does not include a provision for more stringent monitoring of foreign establishments exporting meat and poultry. USDA's marketing and regulatory programs are administered by three agencies: AMS, APHIS, and GIPSA, with a mission to expand domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and protect animal and plant health. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $868.1 million for USDA's marketing and regulatory agencies, including $735.5 million for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to protect U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. This amount is lower than the FY2002 total, which included supplemental appropriations. The FY2003 appropriation for APHIS under P.L. 107-117 increased funds for salaries, expenses, and facilities renovation. The requested amount was $775.3 million, but the final amount provided was $749 million. The Senate proposal for increased border inspection funding was not included in the final appropriation. The inspection function, equipment, Beagle Brigade, and employees were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security under P.L. 107-296. USDA retains control of user fees collected. USDA retains control of user fees collected and repays DHS for border inspection costs. Approximately $275 million in user fees expected in FY2003. Appropriations for equipment, dogs, and training under new Department's budget authority starting FY2004. P.L. 108-7 includes increases for APHIS activities against biological attacks, managing plant pests, Johne's disease, and Wildlife Services programs. Also provides funding for chronic wasting disease management. The P.L. 108-7 bill includes provisions for APHIS to expand laboratory testing capacity for chronic wasting disease, but did not adopt proposals for joint budget requests or additional funds for CWD research. The bill also provides $92.0 million for the Agricultural Marketing Service, with $15.8 million allocated for the pesticide data program. The AMS is responsible for the Section 32 program, which allocates funds to support the farm sector. Most of the funds for FY2003 were transferred to the Food and Nutrition Service and the Commerce Department. Concerns were raised about adequate funds for various activities, including emergency commodity purchases. The USDA used Section 32 funds to pay $937 million for a special livestock disaster assistance program in FY2003. Adjustments were made in other USDA spending accounts to cover both the disaster program and traditional Section 32 activities. Additionally, $250 million was transferred from the CCC to Section 32 for emergency surplus removal of agricultural commodities. Reprogramming of funds between programs was restricted by a provision in the agriculture appropriations act. GIPSA oversees U.S. standards, inspection, and grading for grain and commodities, aiming to ensure fair trading practices. In FY2003, GIPSA received $39.95 million instead of the proposed $44.7 million. The Administration requested $12.2 million, down from $33 million in FY2002. The final law did not include proposed user fees but directed a 2-year study on packer ownership of livestock. The USDA's rural development mission aims to enhance rural communities by providing financial and technical resources through agencies like the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocated $2.795 billion for rural economic and community development programs, exceeding the Administration's budget request of $2.587 billion. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocated $12 billion for rural development loans, higher than the budget request of $7.251 billion. The RCAP program received $907.7 million in budget authority, allowing flexibility in funding allocation. P.L. 108-7 provides funding for various rural development accounts, including $96.8 million for the Community Facilities account, $723.2 million for the Rural Utilities account, and $87.7 million for the Rural Business Development account. The majority of the RCAP authorization supports water and waste disposal grants. Additionally, $18.3 million is earmarked for technical assistance grants, and $12.1 million for the circuit rider program. $30 million is allocated for water and waste disposal programs in Alaskan native villages. P.L. 108-7 provides funding for various rural development accounts, including $24 million for Alaskan native villages, $2 million for Federally Recognized Native American Tribes, $25 million for colonias along the U.S.-Mexican border, $30 million for grants to rural communities with high-energy costs, $25 million for facilities in rural communities suffering extreme unemployment, $7 million for the Rural Community Development Initiative, and $37.6 million for Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities. The Administration's budget did not request direct EZ/EC funding, and the Senate measure did not designate funding to the program. P.L. 108-7 provides $305.5 million for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Program account, supporting a total rural housing loan authorization level of $5.8 billion. This is higher than the proposed amounts by the House and Senate. The appropriation includes funding for various rural housing loan programs, with $100 million for Section 538 multi-family loan guarantees and $4.5 million in loan subsidies. The budget request for Section 538 housing guarantees was $100 million, the same as the House proposal. P.L. 108-7 provides $202 million for Section 502 single family housing, $17 more than the budget request. For Section 515 housing, P.L. 108-7 provides $115 million in loan authorization, nearly double the budget request. The Senate proposed $120 million for Section 515 rental housing. P.L. 108-7 also includes $54 million in direct loan subsidies for Section 515 rental housing. The Department is urged to study Section 515 costs in comparison to other federal programs for rural housing assistance. P.L. 108-7 allocates funds for various housing programs, including $10.8 million for Section 504 housing repairs, $726 million for Section 521 rental assistance, $36.3 million for Farm Labor Program grants, $42.5 million for rural housing assistance grants, and $35 million for mutual and self-help housing grants. Additionally, $11.6 million in rural housing loans is earmarked for empowerment zones and enterprise communities. Rural Utilities Service receives a total subsidy of $12.5 million under P.L. 108-7. P.L.108-7 provides a total subsidy of $12.5 million for programs under the Rural Electrification and Telecommunications Loan Program, with an estimated loan authorization level of $5.6 billion. The loan authorization includes $1 billion for guaranteed underwriting of credit payments. For the Rural Telephone Bank, the loan level is set at $174.6 million. In other RUS programs, there are loan subsidies and grants totaling $56.9 million for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program. P.L. 108-7 provides funding for various rural development programs, including $19.3 million for the Rural Development Loan Fund and $9 million for Rural Cooperative Development Grants. Additionally, $15 million is allocated to EZ/EC areas, despite no direct funding being requested by the Administration. The National Rural Development Partnership and the Local Television Loan Guarantee program receive no funding under this legislation. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $41.89 billion for USDA food and nutrition programs, including $26.313 billion for food stamps. This is $21 million above the Administration's request but below the levels in H.R. 5263 and H.J.Res. 2. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocates $41.89 billion for USDA food and nutrition programs, with $26.313 billion for food stamps. The funding includes expenses for food stamp programs, a reserve fund, nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and Samoa, and commodities for the emergency food assistance program. The enacted level is $24 million more than the Senate-passed level and $64 million more than the Administration request. Additional funding is provided for Puerto Rico and American Samoa, as well as the emergency food assistance program. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocates $41.89 billion for USDA food and nutrition programs, with $26.313 billion for food stamps. The Administration budget anticipated food stamp participation growth of about 800,000 in FY2003. P.L. 108-7 provides $10.580 billion for child nutrition programs, including additional funding for school breakfast program start-up grants, the Food Works of Vermont Common Roots program, and an archive resource center. Independent verification of school food service claims is funded at $5.08 million. WIC receives a total FY2003 appropriation of $4.696 billion. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocates $4.696 billion for the special nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC), including a reserve fund of $125 million as recommended by the Administration. The Administration revised its original WIC proposal, reallocating $25 million from the reserve fund to offset proposed increases in other program spending. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocates $164.5 million for the Commodity Assistance Program, including funds for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) and administrative costs for TEFAP. The House recommended all increase for CSFP, while the Senate proposed $167 million with $5 million for senior farmers' market activities. No funding is provided for the elderly nutrition program in USDA appropriations. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocates $164.5 million for the Commodity Assistance Program, merging the elderly nutrition program with larger meal programs for senior citizens. Funding for Pacific Island and Disaster Assistance remains at $1.081 million. Provisions include prohibiting the use of certain funds for studies, funding hunger fellowships at $3 million, and earmarking funds for specific programs. The FDA, under the DHHS, regulates foods, drugs, vaccines, and medical devices. It is funded through congressional appropriations and user fees, with the FY2003 budget totaling $1.661 billion. This includes $1.391 billion for salaries and expenses, $8 million for facilities, and $270.5 million for user fees. The House bill allocated $1.608 billion, while the Senate bill provided $1.665 billion, including new medical device user fees. The PDUFA was reauthorized in 2002. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 allows FDA to collect user fees for drug and biologic applications. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 authorized FDA to charge user fees for medical device applications. The FY2003 user fee assessments for drugs, biologics, and medical devices were set at $222.9 million, $25.1 million, and $22.5 million respectively. Additionally, $159 million was allocated for FDA counter-terrorism activities related to food and pharmaceutical product safety. Conferees also provided funding for specific budget categories, including $3 million for the Office of Women's Health. The conference agreement allocated funds for FDA initiatives related to hormone replacement therapy, food safety, and international trade issues. This included support for adverse event monitoring systems, financial management upgrades, and advanced testing methods for foods. Additionally, the FDA was prohibited from relocating certain offices. The conferees allocated funds for FDA initiatives, including support for the Codex Alimentarius Commission and generic drug approval.
