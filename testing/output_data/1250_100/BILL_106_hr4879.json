    "content": "The \"Corps of Engineers Reform Act of 2000\" includes provisions for project planning and mitigation. It outlines independent review, stakeholder involvement, monitoring, recommendations, principles, guidelines, and the establishment of an Environmental Advisory Board. Mitigation measures include full and concurrent mitigation. The Act also includes findings and purposes. The \"Corps of Engineers Reform Act of 2000\" emphasizes the need for efficient use of funding, oversight of analyses, and consideration of recreation, clean water, and wildlife habitat in project planning. It aims to ensure that water resource investments are economically justified, provide independent review of feasibility studies, and mitigate social and environmental impacts of projects. Additionally, it emphasizes the involvement of affected interests in project development. The Corps of Engineers Reform Act of 2000 focuses on efficient funding use, oversight of analyses, and consideration of recreation, clean water, and wildlife habitat in project planning.

It also emphasizes involving affected interests in project development. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SECRETARY. In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Army. TITLE I--PROJECT PLANNING SEC. 101. INDEPENDENT REVIEW. Title IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended by adding an independent review section. The Secretary must ensure that feasibility reports for water resources projects exceeding $25,000,000 or deemed controversial are reviewed by an independent panel of experts. An Office of Independent Review is established within the Corps of Engineers, with a Director appointed by the Secretary for a 3-year term from distinguished scholars. The Director of the Office of Independent Review appoints a panel of 5 to 9 experts representing various fields to review projects, ensuring no conflicts of interest. The Director consults with the National Academy of Sciences for expert recommendations and provides compensation for panel members. Panel members are compensated at a rate determined by the Secretary and receive travel expenses. Their duties include reviewing feasibility reports, receiving public comments, and submitting economic, engineering, and environmental analyses to the Secretary. The panel of experts must complete project reviews within 180 days. Controversial projects are defined by public controversy, state objections, or adverse effects on wildlife. The Secretary must consider panel recommendations and make reports public. The cost of project reviews under this section is capped at $250,000 and must be included in any report to Congress. The Secretary has the discretion to waive the limit for valid reasons. SEC. 102. STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT.\n\nThe Secretary will establish a stakeholder advisory group to assist with feasibility studies and promote public participation. The group will have balanced representation of social, economic, and environmental interest groups, and will be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n\nSEC. 103. MONITORING.\n\nTitle IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include a new section on monitoring. ``SEC. 953. MONITORING.\n\nThe Secretary will monitor economic and environmental results of water resources projects costing over $25,000,000 for at least 15 years, providing annual reports to Congress. Monitoring costs will be covered by the Federal government.\n\nSEC. 104. RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary must calculate all project costs, including mitigation costs, before recommending an initial plan for a proposed project.\n\nSEC. 105. PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES.\n\nSection 209 of the Flood Control Act of 1970 is amended to include a Congressional statement of objectives.'' Congress intends for economic development and environmental protection to be equally important in water resources planning. The Secretary is required to revise flood control project guidelines to include ecological restoration and economic development accounts, new risk analysis techniques, and incentives for nonstructural flood damage reduction projects. Additionally, the Secretary must update planning study guidance to align with these changes. SEC. 106. ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY BOARD. Section 905(b) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include a requirement for the Environmental Advisory Board of the Corps of Engineers to review all reconnaissance studies to assess environmental impacts and make recommendations to the Secretary before feasibility studies are conducted based on reconnaissance reports. TITLE II--MITIGATION\n\nSEC. 201. FULL MITIGATION. Section 906(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include standards for mitigation plans as part of project proposals. The Secretary must meet high standards for mitigation, acquire and restore habitat, and replace impacted resources on a one-to-one basis. The Secretary must design mitigation projects to reflect contemporary understanding of habitat distribution and hydrology, fully mitigating adverse impacts. Mitigation plans for water resource projects must cost-effectively and successfully mitigate impacts on aquatic resources before construction. All planned mitigation in a watershed must be completed before constructing new projects. The Secretary must align the text of paragraph (1) with paragraphs (2) through (5) to reflect contemporary understanding of habitat distribution and hydrology for mitigation projects in a watershed. SEC. 202. CONCURRENT MITIGATION. The Secretary must complete 50 percent of required mitigation before project construction and use project funding for mitigation."
