    "content": "The National Missile Defense Act of 1997 aims to deploy a defense system by 2003 to protect the US against limited ballistic missile attacks and potentially larger threats in the future. The policy also emphasizes transitioning to a regime that promotes strategic stability without relying solely on offense-based deterrence. The National Missile Defense Act of 1997 requires the development of a National Missile Defense (NMD) system to achieve initial operational capability by the end of 2003. The system includes interceptors, ground-based radars, space-based sensors, and BM/C3 for defense against limited ballistic missile attacks. The Secretary of Defense is required to initiate preparatory actions for the National Missile Defense System, conduct an integrated systems test by the end of fiscal year 1999, use streamlined acquisition policies to reduce costs, and develop a follow-on program for a layered defense. SEC. 5. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 120 days of the enactment of the Act detailing the plan for developing and deploying a national missile defense system. This report includes the system architecture, justification for selection, estimated appropriations needed for fiscal years 1998-2003, and a determination of any conflicts with the ABM Treaty. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment on the plan for a national missile defense system, including system architecture, justification, funding estimates for 1998-2003, and any conflicts with the ABM Treaty. The report should also include details on activities related to the treaty, legal basis for decisions, and estimated timelines to meet operational capability dates. SEC. 6. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 120 days on the plan for a national missile defense system, including funding estimates and any conflicts with the ABM Treaty. Congress urges the President to pursue high-level discussions with Russia to amend the ABM Treaty for the deployment of the national missile defense system. If an agreement is reached, it must be presented to the Senate for approval. Failure to reach an agreement within one year will result in further action. After one year, the President and Congress may consider withdrawing the United States from the ABM Treaty in consultation with each other, as per Article XV of the treaty. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"ABM Treaty\" refers to the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, signed in Moscow on May 26, 1972. The term \"limited ballistic missile attack\" is defined as per the National Ballistic Defense Capstone Requirements Document issued by the United States Space Command in 1996."
