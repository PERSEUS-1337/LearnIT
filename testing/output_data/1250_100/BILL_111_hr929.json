    "content": "SECTION 1. MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY TRANSITION (MOST) PROGRAM. The Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) program, established under section 3687A of title 38, provides training for eligible veterans with limited transferable skills to the civilian job market. Eligible veterans must meet specific criteria, including being unemployed for at least 90 days in the 180-day period before applying. The MOST program offers payments to employers who provide apprenticeship or on-the-job training to eligible veterans. The program ensures that veterans are paid at least the same rate as nonveterans in similar roles and aims to qualify veterans for employment in their field upon completion of training. The Secretary will hire the veteran at the end of the training, subject to the availability of appropriations. The Secretary will enter into contracts with employers to provide apprenticeship or on-the-job training for eligible veterans. Employers will receive payments based on 50% of the wages paid to veterans, not exceeding $20,000 in total and $1,666.67 per month for the first 12 months of participation. Payments may be extended for veterans on a less than full-time basis. Payments under this section will be made quarterly, with employers required to submit reports on wages paid to eligible veterans. $60,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2018. The Secretary will report on activities in the annual Veterans Benefits Administration report, and the Department will maintain separate accounting. The Department will have a separate line item in budget proposals for funds to carry out this section. A new item will be added to the table of sections. The Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) program, designated as 3687A, involves several conforming amendments to various sections of the title. These changes include adding 3687A to subsections of sections 3034, 3241, 3672, and 4102A(b) of the title."
