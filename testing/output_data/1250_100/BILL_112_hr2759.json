SHORT TITLE, ETC.\" The \"Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act\" requires disclosure of human rights impact of products in the US market, following California's lead in 2010. The Act aims to eradicate slavery and forced labor in supply chains, with exceptions for goods not produced in the US in sufficient quantities. Consumers do not have the right to import goods made with forced or convict labor. American consumers lack standing to bring civil actions in US courts for enforcement of the Tariff Act, as it aims to protect American manufacturers. There have been fewer than 40 enforcement actions in the past 80 years. Other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking in commerce face similar limitations in scope and providing information on tainted goods' specific suppliers. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as severe forms of abuse for commercial profit. Legislation is needed to prevent goods produced through forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US market. Transparency from businesses can help address these issues by providing information to consumers and investors, and responding to their demands. SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE TO SEC RELATING TO SLAVERY CONDITIONS WITHIN PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAINS. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require disclosures on measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor within supply chains. The Commission must promulgate regulations for such disclosures within 270 days of enactment. The amendment to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires disclosures on efforts to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains. This includes maintaining policies to identify and eliminate risks, prohibiting the use of products for exploitative labor, and verifying supply chains for such risks. The amendment to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates disclosures on efforts to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains. This involves maintaining policies to identify and eliminate risks, conducting audits to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards, and assessing supply chain management. Verification processes must include consultations with independent unions, workers' associations, or workers within workplaces. The amendment to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires companies to conduct unannounced audits to assess supply chain management and procurement systems of suppliers for forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor risks. Suppliers must certify compliance with relevant laws, and companies must maintain internal accountability standards for non-compliance. The report outlines standards for supply chain management, including training on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. It also requires compliance with company standards to eliminate exploitative labor practices, conduct audits of labor recruiters, and provide remediation for identified issues within the supply chain. The rules require annual reports in interactive data format, public availability of information, and disclosure on company websites with a link to policies addressing forced labor and human trafficking. The rules mandate disclosure of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor violations by entities with over $100,000,000 in global receipts. Remediation activities must be undertaken if violations are found. The term 'remediation' refers to actions taken to address non-compliance with standards identified through monitoring. 'Supply chain' includes all suppliers of products, parts, and materials used in manufacturing. 'Verification' is the process of evaluating a company's compliance with its program on forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. The curr_chunk focuses on evaluating data gathered through monitoring activities to ensure reliability and credibility, as well as assessing the effectiveness of the system established for remediation of violations related to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor."
