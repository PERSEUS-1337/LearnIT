The \"Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as claimant, harm, defendant, punitive damages, specific findings of fact, and State, which includes various territories and political subdivisions of the United States. The \"Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness Act of 1995\" defines key terms related to punitive damages. The Congress finds that multiple punitive damages for harms from a single act can deplete a defendant's assets, hinder future claimants' compensation, and create unfairness. Concerns have been raised by judges and commentators about the impact of multiple punitive damages. Multiple imposition of punitive damages has raised concerns about violating due process rights and hindering settlement negotiations. Limiting these awards could help resolve mass tort claims, but courts have struggled to find adequate solutions. State legislatures have limited power to address the issue due to lack of control over other states' punitive damages. Punitive damages are generally prohibited in civil actions if they have already been sought or awarded against the defendant for the same act. However, new evidence of additional wrongful behavior may lead to the court awarding punitive damages. The court must make specific findings to support the award, reduce the amount based on previous awards, and keep its actions confidential from the jury. The section outlines the applicability and preemption of punitive damages in civil actions, specifying that it applies to cases seeking punitive damages for the same act or conduct already awarded against the defendant. It also states that the section does not apply to cases where damages are awarded under specific federal or state statutes, and does not override laws limiting punitive damages inconsistent with its provisions. SEC. 4. EFFECT ON OTHER LAW. This Act does not waive sovereign immunity defenses, supersede Federal law, affect the United States' sovereign immunity, preempt State choice-of-law rules for foreign claims, impact venue transfer or foreign law application by courts, or create a cause of action for punitive damages."
