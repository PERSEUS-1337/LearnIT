    "content": "Most financial assistance programs for low-income families focus on increasing income or subsidizing goods and services. However, education and training programs aim to build human capital. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) help low-income families build financial capital by matching participant contributions for specific purposes like education, home purchase, or starting a business. IDA programs also offer financial literacy education and supportive services. IDA programs provide financial literacy education, case management, and supportive services to participants. The Assets for Independence (AFI) Act of 1998 and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program fund IDA programs. AFI grants up to $25 million per year for competitively awarded IDA programs. The Department of Health and Human Services administers the AFI program, which was funded at $19 million for FY2014. Grantees must raise nonfederal funds to operate IDAs, with a maximum federal grant of $1 million. Competitive grants for IDA programs are available to nonprofit organizations and government entities. Grants for IDA programs are available to nonprofit organizations, government entities, credit unions, and community development financial institutions. Faith-based organizations can also operate IDA programs. \"Grandfathered\" state programs funded at $1 million or higher are exempt from AFI's rules. Participants must be eligible for TANF assistance or have income below 200% of the poverty line and a net worth of less than $10,000. IDAs can be established for the participant's benefit. The Individual Development Account (IDA) program allows low-income families to save for specific purposes such as post-secondary education or purchasing a home. Participants contribute cash or checks, which are matched with a minimum of $1 for each $1 contributed. Matching funds come from federal and nonfederal sources, with at least 50% from nonfederal sources. Federal funds have limits of $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for households. Withdrawals can be made for educational expenses or home purchases. The IDA program allows low-income families to save for specific purposes like education or home purchase. Acquisition costs for homes cannot exceed 120% of the average purchase price in the area. The program can also be used for starting a business, with funds approved by financial institutions. Withdrawals can be made for medical expenses, preventing eviction, and living expenses after job loss. Financial literacy education is required for participants, with up to 15% of funds used for this purpose. The AFI Act IDA program includes an evaluation component, with organizations required to submit annual progress reports to HHS. TANF provides flexibility for states to operate IDA programs using federal block grant funds, with specific rules and authority outlined in the law. The TANF IDA program allows states to use federal block grant funds for IDA programs, with rules similar to the AFI Act. Eligibility is limited to those eligible for TANF assistance, and withdrawals can be made for education, home purchase, or starting a business. States have flexibility in designing IDA programs under TANF authority. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) can be established for various purposes beyond educational expenses, home purchase, or starting a business, such as purchasing a car."
