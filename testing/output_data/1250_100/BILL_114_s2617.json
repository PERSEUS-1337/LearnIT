    "content": "The Act titled \"Mapping a New and Innovative Focus on Our Exploration Strategy for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" or \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms policy and findings. The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal of expanding permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit in collaboration with international partners. Congress acknowledges findings from the National Academy of Sciences regarding the goals and direction of human space flight. The Committee on Human Spaceflight concluded that human space exploration has various rationales including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and human survival. They affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve placing humans on Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal for human exploration and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve this. SEC. 3 focuses on the human exploration strategy. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal for human exploration and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve this. Section 202(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars and the establishment of a capability to extend human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA is required to submit a strategy to achieve this objective through a series of sustainable missions utilizing cis-lunar space. The Administrator of NASA is tasked with developing a strategy for human exploration of Mars and extending human presence to the surface of Mars through missions in cis-lunar space. This strategy includes the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for missions to various destinations, collaboration opportunities with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies for economic, scientific, and technological advances. The curr_chunk discusses the scientific needs and opportunities provided by the International Space Station (ISS) for research and technological developments to support human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond. It also covers exploration mission architectures, including capabilities for the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System, with a focus on factors like cost effectiveness, safety, and international collaboration. The curr_chunk focuses on setting standards for crew health and safety in space missions, including radiation exposure limits, medical emergency protocols, and other safety considerations. It emphasizes the need for flexibility in mission architectures to adapt to evolving technologies, partners, priorities, and budget constraints. The curr_chunk outlines crew training needs, mission prioritization, assessment of recommendations, and technical information for potential stakeholders. The Administrator will arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to review and provide feedback on each interim report regarding the strategy outlined in the previous paragraph. The review will identify agreed-upon matters, concerns, and recommendations for further action. The Administrator must ensure timely review and incorporation of National Academy of Sciences' comments on interim reports to comply with requirements. Deadlines for submitting interim and final reports are specified within the Act. The Administrator must submit a final report to Congress every five years on the strategy required by the Act, incorporating the National Academy of Sciences' response to the most recent interim report."
