The Continued Participation Pension Act of 1996 allows qualified beneficiaries to continue accruing benefits in a defined benefit plan after a qualifying event. A qualified beneficiary is any beneficiary under the plan on the day before the qualifying event, including the participant in certain cases. A qualifying event is defined as specific events occurring within seven years of the participant reaching normal retirement age, which would otherwise result in the cessation of benefit accruals. Qualified beneficiaries can continue accruing benefits in a defined benefit plan after a qualifying event, such as the termination or reduction of hours of employment, or the death of the participant. The Act applies to plan years starting on or after July 1, 1996, with a special rule for defined benefit plans under collective bargaining agreements, not applying before the termination of agreements or January 1, 2000."
