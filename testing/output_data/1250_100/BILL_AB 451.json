    "title": "AB 451",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code allows cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use, with regulations on unauthorized parking. If a city or county allows public use of privately owned offstreet parking facilities, the owner must provide instructions on contesting parking fees and cannot use the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution must be enacted with a public hearing and prior notice for privately owned offstreet parking facilities. Violators may be subject to a parking invoice fee, and Section 22507.8 can be enforced without the need for an ordinance or notice posting. The department is not required to patrol or enforce provisions of the code on privately owned offstreet parking facilities. Cities or counties must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinances, including a written policy with specified time periods, an administrative hearing process, and a decision delivered in person or by mail. The examiner may allow payment of parking charges in installments for those unable to pay in full. Incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed invoices are prohibited. A cap on parking invoice fees is set to match municipal fines. Private parking regulators are prohibited from posing as government agencies."
