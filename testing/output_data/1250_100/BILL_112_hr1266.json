    "content": "The Act titled \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" aims to prevent fraudulent prescriptions. The \"Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Act of 2011\" amends Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act to require practitioners to comply with specific reporting requirements when prescribing controlled substances in schedule II or III. This includes submitting patient information, prescription details, and the practitioner's DEA registration information through a web portal. The practitioner must provide their DEA registration number, contact information, and prescription pad number when prescribing controlled substances. Exceptions include medical emergencies and the ability to submit required information up to 7 days after prescribing if the web portal is inaccessible. Before dispensing controlled substances, reporting requirements must be met. Before dispensing a controlled substance in schedule II or III, a practitioner must submit required information to the Attorney General via a web portal. This includes details like the purchaser's name, date of birth, address, dispensing date and time, substance name and amount, refill status, DEA registration number, and contact information. Practitioners must submit information to the Attorney General via a web portal when declining to dispense a controlled substance in schedule II or III, including details required for reporting if the substance had been dispensed and any suspicion of fraud. The Attorney General maintains a web portal that allows practitioners to submit information and receive alerts when submitting information. The practitioner receives alerts if the patient has refilled the same prescription multiple times, attempted to get multiple prescriptions within 30 days, bought controlled substances at different pharmacies or states, or used a reported missing/stolen prescription pad number. The Attorney General establishes a database to contain reported information on controlled substances. Information can be disclosed to practitioners for alerts and to law enforcement authorities as necessary. The Attorney General may disclose information related to investigations involving the unlawful diversion of controlled substances in schedule II or III to authorized individuals or agencies for research purposes. Only appropriated funds can be used for this purpose. The Attorney General can use funds from the Diversion Control Fee Account for investigations related to the unlawful diversion of controlled substances. The Controlled Substances Act provisions will apply once the web portal and database are fully operational."
