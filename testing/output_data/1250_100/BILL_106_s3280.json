FINDINGS.\" In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian schools teach hatred towards Jews and incite violence. The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement of 1995 aimed for educational systems to promote peace. Responsibility for education in these areas was transferred to the Palestinian Ministry of Education after the Oslo Accords. Palestinian schools previously used Jordanian and Egyptian textbooks with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. The Palestinian Ministry of Education developed new textbooks with anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, which are now used in schools in the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli government no longer has authority to change the content. Palestinian Authority school children are taught that Jews and Israel are the enemy. The new Palestinian textbooks contain anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, equating Zionism with Nazism and teaching that Jews are the enemies. They do not acknowledge the State of Israel and portray it as a racist administration oppressing Palestinians. The Palestinian textbooks teach children to fight and eliminate Israel through Jihad and Martyrdom for Allah. They are also instructed to conquer Israel's capital, Jerusalem, and are indoctrinated with the idea that fighting Israel is a religious imperative. The Palestinian textbooks promote Jihad as a religious duty for every Muslim to defend their land and honor, specifically targeting Israel and Jerusalem. Children are taught to protect mosques and liberate al-Aqsa Mosque from Zionist conquest. Palestinian Authority Television, controlled by the Palestinian Authority, promotes anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. Broadcasts include hateful portrayals of Jews and Israel, with statements denying the state of Israel and presenting Zionism as a cancer. Jihad is also promoted through these broadcasts. In May 1998, Palestinian Television broadcasted a message declaring, \"This is our Palestine. We defend it with blood.\" Despite the US not directly aiding the Palestinian Authority since 1995, they allocated $485 million in development assistance in 2000 to NGOs in the West Bank and Gaza for education programs. International aid from various countries and organizations between 1995 and 1998 provided $226.9 million for educational projects in the Palestinian Territories, while the European Community committed over $600 million from 1994 to 1999 for assistance, including education programs. No assistance will be given to the Palestinian Authority until the President confirms to Congress that anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content has been removed from textbooks and media in the West Bank and Gaza. Congress suggests that allies of the US should also impose similar restrictions on aid."
