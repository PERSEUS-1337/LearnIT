The Committee on Appropriations will manage the joint resolution, and its allocations will only take effect once the resolution is enacted into law.

Amendments are made to the Congressional Budget Act regarding the allocation process.

Committees can propose alterations after reporting allocations, which must align with actions taken by the House on related legislation. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO APPROPRIATIONS BILL.
