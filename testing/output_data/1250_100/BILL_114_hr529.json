    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from income tax. These plans help middle-class families save for college, with 11.83 million accounts totaling $244.5 billion in assets. States have made 529 plans accessible by allowing low minimum contributions. The President's fiscal year 2016 Budget proposes raising taxes on future distributions from 529 college savings plans, which could discourage their use and lead to more student debt. The Act aims to strengthen and modernize 529 plans to better support families of all income levels. The Act proposes allowing computer technology and equipment as qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. This includes expenses for the purchase of computer equipment, software, and Internet access to be used primarily by the beneficiary. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014. Additionally, the Act eliminates distribution aggregation requirements. SEC. 3 eliminates distribution aggregation requirements in Section 529(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by striking subparagraph (D). The amendment applies to distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4 allows for the recontribution of refunded amounts. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days after the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. Effective for refunds after December 31, 2014. Beneficiaries can recontribute higher education expenses within 60 days after refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. Effective for refunds after December 31, 2014. Beneficiaries can recontribute higher education expenses within 60 days after refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. Effective for refunds after December 31, 2014. Passed the House of Representatives on February 25, 2015."
