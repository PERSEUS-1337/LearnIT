    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vaccine Accessibility for Children and Seniors Act of 2005\" or the \"VACS Act of 2005.\" The Congress acknowledges the importance of vaccines in public health, highlighting their role in saving lives and preventing disabilities. Vaccines are available for various diseases, reducing medical costs and benefiting the community. However, the threat of litigation and high manufacturing costs have led to a decrease in the production of essential vaccines. In the 1980s, a litigation crisis led to a decrease in vaccine manufacturers, leaving only 4 companies producing the majority of vaccines in the US. This scarcity was highlighted in 2004 when a flu vaccine shortage occurred due to costly liability lawsuits. To address this issue, Congress established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986 to lower legal risks for manufacturers and ensure prompt compensation for injured patients. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the United States Court of Federal Claims provides compensation for vaccine-related injuries, including economic damages for medical expenses, rehabilitation, lost earnings, and pain and suffering. Over $1.5 billion has been paid out for claims, with some awards exceeding $1 million and up to $7.5 million. Despite the program's intent to lower legal risks for manufacturers, vaccine companies still face costly litigation due to individuals opting out and pursuing lawsuits in State and Federal courts. To ensure valid scientific evidence and protect public health policy, litigation involving vaccines outside the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program must occur exclusively in US district courts. This includes cases related to vaccine ingredients, preservatives, and components, with all procedures and expert testimony subject to federal jurisdiction. The Act aims to establish legal reforms to streamline vaccine manufacturing and ensure litigation is based on valid scientific evidence. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General, in consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, must study and report to Congress within one year on recommendations for fair compensation of injured patients through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The Act aims to establish legal reforms to streamline vaccine manufacturing, discourage frivolous litigation, and ensure injured patients are compensated fairly and promptly in the appropriate forum.

Federal Court Remedy. Section 2122 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a Federal cause of action for claims related to vaccine injuries or deaths occurring after October 1, 1988. This cause of action is the exclusive remedy for such injuries, with jurisdiction in Federal courts. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction over actions for damages from vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988. Any civil action in a State court can be removed to a federal district court. An order remanding a removed action is appealable. The jurisdiction over vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988, is governed by title 28, United States Code. State causes of action for damages or equitable relief related to vaccine injuries are preempted. The definition of a vaccine includes preservatives, ingredients, or components. Sanctions for frivolous vaccine litigation and a 3-strikes rule for suspending attorneys who commit multiple Rule 11 violations. Sanctions for attorneys who violate Rule 11 in vaccine-related cases, with mandatory suspension for 3 or more violations, appeal rights, and reinstatement process. After completing a suspension under subsection (a), an attorney must petition the district court of the United States for reinstatement following procedures and conditions set by the court. The trial procedure is outlined in Section 5. In an amendment to the Public Health Service Act, Section 2123 is modified to include a new stage in civil actions to determine if scientific evidence proves a vaccine caused an injury or death. If proven, a second stage of the trial will follow. In an amendment to the Public Health Service Act, Section 2123 is modified to include a new stage in civil actions to determine if scientific evidence proves a vaccine caused an injury or death. Subsection (d) is changed to \"third\" and subsection (e) is changed to \"fourth\". A conforming amendment is made to section 2122(b)(2) by replacing \"2123(d)(2)\" with \"2123(e)(2)\". Transition rules are outlined in Section 6. If a State law claim for damages or equitable relief related to a vaccine injury is pending in court, the plaintiff can elect to treat it as a Federal law claim within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. Failure to file notice within this period will result in dismissal of the claim in State court. If a claim is pending in State court prior to final judgment, any party can remove the action to the district court by filing a notice of removal with a statement of grounds and relevant documents. The State court must stop proceedings unless the case is remanded. Failure to properly remove a case within 40 days will result in dismissal. Within 40 days of the enactment of this Act, any pending claim in State court or remanded to State court must be promptly dismissed with prejudice. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT. The Congress intended the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to be a flexible, no-fault system to handle claims quickly and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports suggest delays, increased adversarial process, and a drift towards full-blown litigation, contrary to Congress' intent. After consulting with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General of the United States will jointly submit a report to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. The report will include recommendations to ensure that injured patients with legitimate claims are compensated quickly and fairly in a less adversarial manner."
