The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2009 establishes a government-wide acquisition management fellows program to invest in the improvement of the Federal acquisition workforce by developing new leaders with government-wide perspective and skills, recruiting individuals with academic merit and leadership skills, and offering advancement opportunities at executive agencies. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy will contract with qualified universities for a training program consisting of one year of on-campus training followed by two years of on-the-job training towards a Masters degree. The curriculum includes rotational assignments at executive agencies and non-agency-specific training courses for basic contracting officer warrant. The training program includes courses on basic contracting officer warrant, transparency, accountability, and integrity in the public contracting process. Graduates receive priority for employment in acquisition fields at GS-12, 13, or 14 levels. Hiring must comply with merit system principles. The program under title 5, United States Code, limits participants to 200 individuals annually, with a minimum of 50 in the first year, 100 in the second year, and 150 thereafter. The Administrator is responsible for program management, placement of graduates, and oversight. Qualified universities administer the program, selecting and removing participants based on academic processes. The Acquisition Fellows Program requires participants to commit to federal employment in acquisition for a minimum term. Those who do not fulfill the service requirements must reimburse the government. Additionally, an Acquisition Fellows Program Fund is established. The `OFPP Acquisition Fellows Development Fund' is established in the Treasury of the United States for the program's operations and expenses, including tuition, room and board, travel, stipends, and other necessary costs. The Fund shall consist of appropriated amounts for necessary expenses. The Administrator is required to submit reports on the government-wide acquisition management fellows program, including a preliminary report within 120 days of enactment and annual reports thereafter. The reports must detail program activities, participant numbers, training provided, and effectiveness assessments. The Administrator must submit reports on the government-wide acquisition management fellows program, detailing program activities, participant numbers, training provided, effectiveness assessments, and recommendations for additional legislative or administrative action.
