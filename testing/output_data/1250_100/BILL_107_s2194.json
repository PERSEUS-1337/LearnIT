    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arafat Accountability Act\". It includes findings related to the accountability of Arafat. The \"Arafat Accountability Act\" finds that the PLO, led by Yasser Arafat, failed to uphold promises made in the Oslo Accords regarding peace, renunciation of terrorism, and maintaining law and order in the West Bank and Gaza. Arafat's lack of credible security guarantees has led to ongoing terrorism against Israeli and American civilians. Yasser Arafat has violated his commitment to peace by purchasing offensive weaponry from Iran, funding terrorists responsible for attacks in Israel, and failing to respond adequately to end homicide bombings, complicating the conflict resolution prospects in the region. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress outlined in Section 3 includes urging an immediate cessation of terrorist activities, surrender of Palestinian extremists to Israel, and concrete actions by Yasser Arafat and the PLO to condemn terrorism and dismantle terrorist infrastructures. The Congress supports efforts to end financial support for terrorism and urges Arab nations to stop funding terrorist operations and payments to families of terrorists. Congress also backs the President's work with Israel, Arab states, and the international community to achieve peace in the region.
