    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new tax credit for first-time homebuyers purchasing a principal residence. A tax credit of 10% of the purchase price of the first principal residence is allowed for first-time homebuyers. The credit is limited to $2,500 and applies to individuals without ownership of a principal residence in the past 3 years. First-time homebuyers are eligible for a tax credit of 10% of the purchase price of their first principal residence, limited to $2,500. The credit applies to individuals without ownership of a principal residence in the past 3 years. The maximum credit is allocated among individuals purchasing a residence, and certain individuals are ineligible if specific conditions are met. Ownership interest does not include certain contracts of deed. The eligibility period is defined as the 1-year period beginning on the date of purchase. The eligibility period for the tax credit is the 1-year period starting from the enactment date. A residence is considered purchased during this period if a binding contract is entered into and the residence is purchased and occupied within 3 months after the eligibility period. The term 'purchase' refers to any property acquisition not from a disqualified person. The tax credit eligibility period is 1 year from enactment. A residence is considered purchased if a binding contract is entered into and the property is bought and occupied within 3 months. The term 'purchase' excludes acquisitions from disqualified persons. The adjusted basis of the property determines the purchase price. Unused credit can be carried over to the next taxable year if it exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a). The tax credit can be carried over to the next taxable year if it exceeds the limit, but no amount can be carried forward beyond the 5th year after the purchase. If the taxpayer disposes of the property within 36 months of acquisition, the tax for that year is increased by the credit amount allowed for the purchase. If a taxpayer purchases a new principal residence within the specified period after disposing of their old residence, the tax for the year of purchase is increased by the difference between the credit claimed for the new residence and the credit that could have been claimed for the old residence. This provision does not apply in cases of death, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion of the old residence within the 36-month period. The tax code allows for an increase in tax if a taxpayer purchases a new principal residence after disposing of their old residence, except in cases of death, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion within a specified period. The tax code amendment applies to first-time homebuyers purchasing a principal residence, effective for taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
