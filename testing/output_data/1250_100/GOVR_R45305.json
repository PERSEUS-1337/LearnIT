The U.S. plays a significant role in international agricultural markets, subjecting its farm policy to scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules. The farm bill, in place since the 1930s, locks in U.S. policy behavior and support programs, typically renewed every five or six years. The current omnibus farm bill is the Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79). The 2014 farm bill made significant changes to existing farm programs, with commodity programs becoming operational in 2014. The current farm bill is set to expire in 2018 and may be replaced, extended, or allowed to lapse. U.S. agricultural policy is constrained by WTO commitments, with the Agreement on Agriculture being paramount in governing domestic agricultural support. The WTO agreements, including the Agreement on Agriculture and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, set limits on market-distorting policies and govern trade among member countries. Violations of WTO rules can lead to challenges and potential changes in domestic farm programs to comply. Designing farm programs that adhere to WTO rules can help avoid trade disputes. Policymakers often consider how new farm proposals will impact U.S. commitments under the WTO. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs based on their potential to distort commercial markets. Amber box subsidies, which have the greatest potential to distort markets, are subject to spending limits, while more benign outlays are exempted under green box, blue box, de minimis, or special and differential treatment exemptions. The AoA provides detailed rules and procedures to guide member countries in making changes to their domestic farm policies to facilitate more open trade. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) categorizes agricultural domestic support programs into green box, blue box, and amber box programs. Green box programs are non-trade distorting, blue box programs are production-limiting, and amber box programs are market-distorting with strict spending limits. The United States has a spending limit of $19.1 billion for amber box programs, with de minimis exemptions for small domestic support spending. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture categorizes domestic support programs into green box, blue box, and amber box programs with spending limits. De minimis exemptions are limited to 5% of production value. Prohibited programs include certain export and import subsidies. WTO members must submit notification reports on policy implementation for monitoring. The U.S. submitted its most recent notification in 2018 for the 2015 crop year. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) outlines rules for determining prohibited and actionable subsidies in U.S. farm programs. The key aspect is the degree of market distortion caused by domestic support programs, evaluated based on criteria like subsidy share of farmer returns, commodity importance in world markets, and causal relationship with adverse market effects. The SCM assesses market distortion in terms of measurable effects on the market. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) evaluates the market distortion caused by domestic support programs in U.S. farm programs. It assesses the impact on international trade and market prices for the affected commodity, looking at factors like displacement of imports, exports, price suppression, and world market share increase. WTO dispute settlement panels determine if challenged subsidies are prohibited, requiring immediate cessation or withdrawal, with potential for countermeasures by the challenging nation. The WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) provides a means for resolving disputes between member nations. If a dispute cannot be settled through consultations, a panel may be requested to examine and report on the complaint. The DSU allows for Appellate Body review of panel reports and possible retaliation if a defending member fails to comply with a WTO decision. The United States has been involved in a significant number of WTO disputes since 1995, with the Office of the United States Trade Representative representing the country in these cases. The United States Trade Representative represents the US in WTO disputes and is committed to spending no more than $19.1 billion per year on trade-distorting support under the AoA. The procedures for classifying trade-distorting support are complex, with questions to determine compliance with the annual limit. These questions include classification as \"green box,\" \"blue box,\" or \"amber box\" policies, and the 5% de minimis exemption for excluding support from AMS calculation. The United States Trade Representative is committed to spending no more than $19.1 billion per year on trade-distorting support under the AoA. The classification of trade-distorting support involves questions about compliance with the annual limit, including the criteria for \"green box,\" \"blue box,\" or \"amber box\" policies, and the 5% de minimis exemption. The green box spending is not limited as it is considered minimally or non-trade distorting. To qualify for exemption in the green box, a program must meet specific criteria related to different types of agriculture-related programs. The green-box-qualifying program must benefit the agricultural or rural community without providing price support to producers. It can include research, pest control, training, inspection services, marketing, and infrastructure development. Public acquisition for food security and transparent domestic food aid are also allowed. The green-box-qualifying program aims to benefit the agricultural or rural community without providing price support to producers. It includes various services like research, pest control, training, and infrastructure development. Domestic food aid should be financially transparent and based on defined eligibility and nutritional criteria. Income support should have clear eligibility criteria and not be related to production or prices. Payments should compensate for less than 70% of income loss, based solely on income. Total annual payments, including natural disaster relief, cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Payments for natural disaster relief are determined by a production loss exceeding 30% in the preceding three-year period and cannot exceed the total replacement cost. Structural adjustment programs aim to facilitate producers' retirement from agricultural production or resource retirement by removing land, livestock, or other resources from marketable production. Total annual payments, including income insurance, cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Structural adjustment programs provide investment aids for producers facing structural disadvantages, with criteria for financial or physical restructuring. Payments are not tied to production type/quantity or prices, limited to compensate for the disadvantage, and for a specific time period. Environmental program payments have eligibility criteria determined by government environmental policies. Payments for environmental or conservation programs must meet specific conditions and be limited to extra costs. Regional assistance is for disadvantaged producers in designated regions. Payments should not be tied to production or prices, must decrease over time, and cover extra costs in agriculture. Eligible for the green box if criteria are met. The green box exemption allows measures to be exempt from AMS if they meet specific criteria. If not, they can qualify for the blue box exemption, which has no spending limits but requires specific conditions to be met. If a measure does not qualify for either exemption, it is considered an amber box policy, and the next step is to determine if spending exceeds the 5% de minimis rate. The \"amber box\" policies may be excluded under two de minimis exclusions: Product-specific domestic support not exceeding 5% of the total value of production of a basic agricultural product, and support provided through all measures specific to a product. For example, U.S. corn crop AMS outlays were below the 5% threshold, exempting them from inclusion under the AMS limit. In contrast, U.S. sugar support easily exceeded its 5% de minimis threshold. The United States exceeded its 5% product-specific de minimis threshold for sugar support, which was counted against the AMS limit. Non-product-specific domestic support is also considered, with all support tallied to determine if the 5% threshold is exceeded. If total U.S. AMS does not exceed $19.1 billion, the WTO commitment is met. The United States has never exceeded its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit, with de minimis exemptions instrumental in avoiding breaches in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The 2014 farm bill includes a safety trigger for USDA to adjust program outlays to stay within the limit. WTO compliance also considers adverse market effects from domestic farm support programs, especially relevant for the U.S. as a major player in agricultural markets. The United States is a major player in agricultural markets, being a consumer, exporter, and importer of agricultural commodities. The WTO may challenge U.S. farm programs that distort markets, such as the case with Brazil's challenge against U.S. cotton programs. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations on agricultural trade began in 2001 and resumed in 2011, focusing on areas with potential progress. Completion of the negotiations is not expected soon. The U.S. is a key player in agricultural markets, facing challenges from the WTO regarding farm programs that distort markets. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations on agriculture, which started in 2001 and resumed in 2011, aims for substantial reductions in trade-distorting support while preserving \"green box\" policies. Congress may seek domestic farm policies compliant with WTO agreements."
