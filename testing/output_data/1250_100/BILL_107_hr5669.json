    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act of 2002\". Congress finds that nanotechnology offers unprecedented scientific and technological opportunities in various fields such as materials, electronics, medicine, energy, and national security. Government funding for long-term, high-risk research is essential to drive breakthroughs in technology. Advancements in nanotechnology, funded by the government, will lead to significant technological developments with potential benefits for the Federal government. The market for nanotechnology products in the US could exceed $1 trillion in the future, requiring a unique skill set for scientists and engineers. Research on nanotechnology is crucial for developing skilled workers with multidisciplinary perspectives. It also raises social, ethical, and legal issues that require reflection and guidance. Maintaining international leadership in nanotechnology is vital for national security. The Executive Branch established the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) to coordinate Federal nanotechnology research and development programs, contributing significantly to nanotechnology development. Authorizing legislation can establish new technology goals, improve agency coordination, ensure optimal returns on investments, and simplify reporting processes for the Executive Branch and Congress. The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board (referred to as the Advisory Board) is established to provide advice on research investment policy, strategy, program goals, and management processes related to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The Advisory Board will operate in coordination with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The President, with the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish procedures for selecting up to 20 qualified individuals from industry and academia to serve on the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board. Members must have expertise in various fields related to nanotechnology and hold diverse views on societal, ethical, educational, legal, and workforce issues. The President will consider recommendations from various entities when appointing members, and designate a Chairperson for the Advisory Board. The President will appoint a Chairperson for the Advisory Board who will serve for 3 years. Each member will serve for 1 to 3 years and may be reappointed. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members will not receive pay but will get travel expenses. The Advisory Board will meet at least 2 times per year. The President will establish a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office to support the Advisory Board and coordinate Federal nanotechnology activities. The staff of the office will be appointed according to civil service laws and paid based on classification and General Schedule pay rates. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program's goals, research needs, performance metrics, and increasing investments in nanotechnology and biology research. The Advisory Board advises on the creation of programs for new instruments in nanoscience, fostering industrial partnerships for commercialization, addressing workforce issues, and coordinating research efforts among Federal agencies and the Department of Defense. They consult with various entities for input. The Federal nanotechnology program should consider societal implications and involve local governments, agencies, and research entities in nanotechnology research. The Federal nanotechnology program should involve local governments, agencies, and research entities in nanotechnology research. Additionally, reports are required as per SEC. 7. The Advisory Board must submit an annual report to the President, relevant agencies, and congressional committees. The report should cover the program's technical success, management and coordination among agencies, funding levels, and portfolio balance. The Advisory Board's annual report should include a review of policy issues related to nanotechnology, recommendations for new program goals and research areas, and suggestions for new investments by participating agencies. The Advisory Board's annual report should include a technology transition study evaluating the success of the Federal nanotechnology research program in commercial and military product development, highlighting successful transitions, best practices, barriers, and recommendations for government support. The Advisory Board's annual report should evaluate the success of the Federal nanotechnology research program in commercial and military product development, highlighting successful transitions, best practices, barriers, and recommendations for government sponsored activities to promote rapid technology transition in the nanotechnology sector. The Federal Advisory Committee Act's termination clause does not apply to this Act. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this Act."
