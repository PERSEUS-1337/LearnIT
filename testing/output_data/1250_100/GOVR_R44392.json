    "content": "The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) covers 72.5% of the premium for eligible taxpayers, who are responsible for the remaining 27.5%. It can be used towards qualified health insurance and is refundable and advanceable. Eligibility is based on receiving certain benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program or being aged 55-64 and receiving payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Workers who lose their jobs due to international trade can qualify for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) by petitioning the U.S. Department of Labor. If approved, they can receive benefits such as Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) and Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA), which provide financial support and wage supplements. Eligible workers can also receive the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) to help cover health insurance premiums. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is available to individuals who receive TRA, RTAA, or ATAA cash benefits under Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). Additionally, individuals may qualify for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) benefits if their defined-benefit pension plan was insured and taken over by the PBGC due to termination circumstances. The PBGC uses plan assets and insurance reserves to pay pensions to former workers and their survivors. Eligibility for the HCTC program has limitations, including not being eligible if enrolled in certain health plans or programs like Medicare, FEHBP, Medicaid, or CHIP. Additionally, individuals cannot be eligible for Medicare Part A or U.S. military health system coverage to qualify for the HCTC. Other restrictions include being incarcerated or claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer. An eligible taxpayer can use the HCTC for health insurance covering their spouse and dependents. Children of divorced or separated parents are considered dependents of the custodial parent. Family members can receive the HCTC for up to two years after specific events. The tax credit can only be used for qualified health insurance in 11 categories. Four categories are automatically qualified health plans that individuals can choose without state involvement. Individuals may elect various health coverage options without state involvement, including COBRA, coverage through a spouse's employer, individual health insurance, and coverage funded by a VEBA. State-qualified health plans are also available, but individuals can only choose these options if their state has established them. These state-qualified options include state-based continuation coverage, coverage through a state high-risk pool, coverage for state employees, and other arrangements made by the state with health insurance providers or employers. State-qualified health plans offer coverage with four consumer protections for qualifying individuals, including guaranteed issue, coverage regardless of preexisting conditions, equal premiums, and similar benefits. Certain types of coverage are not considered qualified health insurance. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program is administered by the IRS and involves multiple federal and state agencies. The Department of the Treasury handles the advance payment system for the HCTC, while the IRS reviews tax returns claiming the credit. The Department of Labor (DOL) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) assist Treasury in identifying eligible individuals. DOL also coordinates the One-Stop Career Center system, which provides job seekers with information about benefits like the HCTC. The HCTC program involves federal and state agencies like DOL, SWAs, PBGC, and IRS. SWAs and PBGC identify eligible individuals and provide their information to the IRS. Eligible taxpayers can claim the tax credit when filing their returns or receive advance payments monthly. The HCTC is refundable, allowing taxpayers to receive the full amount. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is a refundable tax credit that allows taxpayers to receive the full amount they are eligible for, regardless of their tax liability. Claiming the HCTC does not affect eligibility for other tax credits, except for the premium tax credit under the Affordable Care Act. In 2013, 13,693 tax returns claimed the HCTC, totaling $52.3 million. Taxpayers must complete Form 8885 and provide proof of payment for qualified health insurance to claim the credit. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is a refundable tax credit that reduces taxes owed for a taxpayer. If the credit amount exceeds taxes owed, the excess is refunded. To receive advance payments, individuals register with the HCTC program, enroll in a qualified health insurance plan, and pay their share of the premium. Treasury then pays the full premium to the health insurance plans."
