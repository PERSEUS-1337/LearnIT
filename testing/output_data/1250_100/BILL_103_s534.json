The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against various unavoidable causes, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, and frost. Insurance coverage is limited to the period the commodity is in the field. For aquacultural species, the term 'field' refers to the production environment. Insurance must cover 75% of the average yield on the insured farm, with adjustments made for fairness. Additionally, lesser levels of yield coverage are available to producers. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, and frost. Insurance coverage is limited to the period the commodity is in the field, with coverage at 50 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield available to producers. Adjusted yields established by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service can be used for insurance coverage, with additional premiums required. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to provide insurance coverage for agricultural commodities against natural disasters. The Corporation can set rates for coverage to accurately reflect increased risk and ensure there are enough funds to cover losses and establish reserves. Additionally, the Corporation may offer coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of the average yield if normal yield variations have not resulted in losses. The maximum coverage level is subject to certain limitations. The Corporation may offer insurance coverage for agricultural commodities up to 75 percent of the average yield. The projected market price option must be at least 90 percent of the projected market price. Insurance does not cover losses due to neglect, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board can limit or refuse insurance based on the insurance risk. The Corporation provides insurance coverage for agricultural commodities based on average yield, with a minimum projected market price set by the Board. Insurance does not cover losses from neglect or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board can restrict insurance in counties where agricultural income is deemed insignificant, but may offer coverage in bordering areas with crop-insurance programs. The Corporation must report annual results to Congress for each insured commodity. The insurance coverage provided by the Corporation for agricultural commodities is determined by the Board based on average yield and a minimum projected market price. The coverage is quoted in terms of dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee for each day of delay. Late planting coverage is automatically included in a basic insurance policy for producers unless they opt out. If late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters, with eligibility for 50% coverage of the guaranteed level. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop, which can offset the remaining coverage for the insured crop. Producers on a farm are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they opt out. If offering prevented planting coverage would significantly increase premiums and deter participation, it will be provided as a separate endorsement. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS.\n\nSection 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of actual production is less than harvesting costs.\n\nSEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to establish yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. The Corporation will set a minimum insurance protection level for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data can be used if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years on a farm. The Corporation allows producers to use previous yield history or transitional yield data for new parcels of land for crop insurance purposes. Adjustments will be made in Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for producers. The Code of Federal Regulations allows for the use of transitional yield data to establish a yield for producers in cases where actual production records are not available."
