    "content": "The \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\" is established in response to the devastating 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and the potential seismic threat along the west coast of the United States. Scientists predict a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major earthquake and tsunami in the next 50 years, highlighting the need for preparedness in coastal communities. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program's primary goal is to assist departments in tsunami hazard preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially those lacking resources to protect public health and safety. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security can provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis, prioritizing those with a 10% or higher likelihood within 50 years. Grants are awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with emergency services providers. An emergency management department receiving a grant can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for tsunami education. Matching funds are also required. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS.\n\nEmergency management departments in areas with different population sizes must provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for grants under this Act. In-kind contributions can also be considered for up to 50 percent of the non-Federal share. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant awards. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation completion. SEC. 8.
