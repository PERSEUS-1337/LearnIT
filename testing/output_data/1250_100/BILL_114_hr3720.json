    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the Environmental Protection Agency promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products, enhancing public awareness, and educating the public on water recycling. The WaterSense program aims to promote water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes through public outreach, education, research, and development. It also focuses on establishing performance standards for WaterSense labeled products, ensuring proper installation and maintenance, preserving label integrity, and regularly updating criteria. Additionally, it collects and shares production data with the public.

It also focuses on establishing performance standards for WaterSense labeled products, ensuring proper installation and maintenance, preserving label integrity, and regularly updating criteria. Additionally, it collects and shares production data with the public, estimates water and energy savings, solicits feedback on criteria changes, and provides notice of any revisions. The WaterSense program aims to promote water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes through public outreach, education, research, and development. It focuses on establishing performance standards for labeled products, ensuring proper installation and maintenance, preserving label integrity, and updating criteria. Responses to comments by interested parties are considered, lead time is provided before new or revised criteria, and voluntary approaches like labeling waterless devices are encouraged to improve water efficiency. Authorization of appropriations is set at $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2016 and $10,000,000 for fiscal year. The WaterSense program has authorized appropriations of $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2016, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is addressed in Section 3. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" \"FEMP designated product,\" and \"product and service.\" The terms exclude water consuming products for combat missions and those already covered by Federal procurement regulations. The head of an agency must procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products for water consuming products, with exceptions if not cost-effective. Installation should be done by certified professionals for optimal performance. The head of an agency must incorporate criteria for WaterSense products and FEMP designated products into procurement specifications and evaluation factors to reduce water consumption. Additional measures like water reuse and leak detection should also be considered. The General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency must prominently display WaterSense products and FEMP designated products in federal catalogs. They should supply only these products unless specified otherwise in writing. Regulations must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment by the Administrator of the Environmental. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will issue regulations to implement this section after the Act is enacted. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like \"Administrator,\" \"eligible entity,\" \"incentive program,\" and \"residential water efficient product or service\" for a program that offers financial incentives for water-efficient products and services. The WaterSense program or an approved incentive program can certify water efficient products like faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads through third-party testing and certification. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States, including Puerto Rico and Guam. The \"WaterSense program\" is defined as a program established by a specific Act. Eligible entities can receive allocations if they have an incentive program for water-efficient products, submit an application, and assure the funds will supplement existing programs. The Administrator determines allocations for eligible entities based on population served, target population, program effectiveness, and prior year's unused funds. Allocated funds can cover up to 50% of establishing and running incentive programs. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling programs for older fixtures replaced under the incentive program. Financial incentives may be issued to consumers meeting program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The incentive amount is determined based on various factors, including entity allocation, available tax incentives, consumer behavior change, and onsite preparation costs. Authorization of Appropriations.--$50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020 are authorized for the Administrator to carry out this section, including consumer expenditures for onsite preparation, assembly, and original installation of the product. SEC. 5. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section introduces a new incentive program under the Internal Revenue Code where individuals can receive income exemptions for participating in water-efficient products programs. No double benefits are allowed, and the adjusted basis of property is reduced by the exempted amount. The amendments made by this Act regarding early adopter water efficient products incentive programs apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment date."
