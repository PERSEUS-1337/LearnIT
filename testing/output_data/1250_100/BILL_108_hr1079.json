Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for a deduction adjustment to mimic expensing for certain property placed in service after December 31, 2003. The deduction amount is modified to 150 percent instead of 200 percent for property eligible for full expensing under section 179. The applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for property placed in service is determined by dividing the gross domestic product deflator for the quarter when the property was placed in service by the deflator for the corresponding quarter in the taxable year. The applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for property placed in service is calculated by multiplying a number by 1.035 to the nth power, where 'n' is the number of full years from when the property was placed in service. The ratio will never be less than 1 and is rounded to the nearest \\1/1000\\. The neutral cost recovery ratio is determined without regard to certain subparagraphs. The gross domestic product deflator is used for calculations. Taxpayers can elect not to apply this subsection to their property. Churning transactions are exempt from this subsection. The additional deduction does not affect basis or recapture. The adjusted basis of property in pass-thru entities is not affected by certain deductions. Pass-thru entities include regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and common trust funds. For property placed in service after December 31, 2003, a neutral cost recovery ratio is used under section 168(k) for minimum tax treatment. For property placed in service after December 31, 2003, the deduction allowable is determined by multiplying the amount for the taxable year by the applicable neutral cost recovery ratio under section 168(k). This deduction does not apply to property with an election not to have section 168(k) apply. Additionally, the neutral cost recovery deduction does not apply to the additional deduction allowed by section 168(k). The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 2003, regarding the coordination with the depreciation limitation on certain automobiles. The unrecovered basis of any passenger automobile includes the additional amount determined under section 168(k) to the extent not allowed as a deduction."
