    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, governs labor-management relations in the private sector by improving workers' bargaining power. It allows workers to join or form a union, bargain collectively over wages and conditions, and protects their right not to join. Employers are required to bargain in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The NLRA protects the rights of employers and workers, defines unfair labor practices, and does not exclude unauthorized workers from engaging in union activities. The NLRB administers and enforces the NLRA, resolves objections to elections, determines bargaining units, and investigates unfair labor practices. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union based on a \"community of interest.\" A bargaining unit is a group of employees with similar interests in wages, hours, and working conditions. It can include employees from one employer, establishment, or occupation. Professional and nonprofessional employees can be in the same unit if the majority of professionals agree. Guards cannot be in the same unit as other employees. The NLRB settles disputes over the appropriate bargaining unit. In a case involving certified nursing assistants (CNAs) at a healthcare center in Mobile, AL, the NLRB found the petitioned-for unit of CNAs to be appropriate, despite the employer's objection. The CNAs at the healthcare center in Mobile, AL, are part of the appropriate bargaining unit, as determined by the NLRB. Their duties include assisting residents with daily functions, wearing nursing uniforms, and working one of three eight-hour shifts. The employer argued that other employees with similar educational requirements should be included in the unit, such as resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks. The CNAs at the healthcare center in Mobile, AL, are part of the appropriate bargaining unit, as determined by the NLRB. They receive annual evaluations, pay raises, and benefits similar to service and maintenance employees. The board voted in favor of the CNAs, citing their distinct training, certification, and work conditions. Campaign rules differ for soliciting union support and distributing union literature. Employers may campaign against unionization and hold \"captive audience\" meetings during work hours. Employees can campaign for union support during work hours in nonwork areas. If an employer restricts literature distribution in work areas, employees can distribute in nonwork areas. Employees can use their work e-mail for union activities if the employer allows e-mail use for other causes. Union organizers may not campaign on company property but can distribute literature on public property or contact employees at home. Nonemployee union organizers may be allowed in the workplace under certain conditions. The NLRA protects the rights of employees and employers regarding union activities. Employers cannot interfere with employees' rights to form or join a union, threaten job loss or benefits, close a plant, raise wages to discourage unionization, or discriminate against union activities. Employers must bargain in good faith. Unions cannot coerce employees to join or not join, threaten job loss for lack of support, or coerce employers. The NLRA prohibits employers from interfering with employees' rights to unionize and outlines the process for addressing unfair labor practices. Unions must bargain in good faith and cannot engage in coercive tactics. The NLRB investigates unfair labor practice charges and can issue cease-and-desist orders to stop violations. The NLRA allows the NLRB to issue cease-and-desist orders to stop unfair labor practices and order remedies for violations. Backpay can be awarded to workers fired or discriminated against for union activities, with estimates of 1,000 to 3,000 illegal firings per year. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay was awarded. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and stood at 21,629 in FY2012. In FY2012, 36.4% of unfair labor practice charges were found to have merit. The NLRA allows unions to be designated by majority vote. Employees can join a union through NLRB election, employer recognition, or NLRB order. Certification through secret ballot or employer recognition is required for collective bargaining to begin. The NLRB conducts a secret ballot election when a petition is filed requesting one by a union, worker, or employer. An employer may request an election if a union claims to represent a majority of its employees. If a majority of employees in the NLRB-conducted election choose union representation, the union is certified as the bargaining representative. Certification does not require an initial contract agreement. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections to determine union representation. If an agreement is not reached, a hearing may be held, and the regional director may direct an election. Employees choose whether to be represented by a union in the election. Challenges to voting rights can be made, and objections to the election can be filed. A union and employer may agree to a third-party conducted secret ballot election. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for union representation, including decertification petitions signed by at least 30% of employees. Changes to representation procedures were made in 2012. The NLRB made changes to representation procedures on April 30, 2012, but suspended them in response to a court decision on May 14, 2012. The changes included giving hearing officers discretion to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to representation questions and consolidating pre- and post-election requests for review. Under the final rule, the NLRB would grant special permission for review of pre-election decisions only in extraordinary circumstances. The 25-day waiting period for election scheduling was eliminated in a rule from December 22, 2011. Requests for review of decisions by regional directors on challenges and objections to elections would have been discretionary under this rule. In FY2010, the NLRB conducted 1,823 elections with unions winning 62.3% of them, up from 46.6% in FY1994. Most elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the employer and union. The median time to proceed to an election from the filing of a petition was 38 days. In FY2011, post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases, with a median of 62 days to issue a decision. The NLRB does not collect data on the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an election. A recent study estimated that within two years of winning an NLRB election, a contract had not been reached in over two-fifths of cases. The NLRA does not require secret ballot elections and allows for voluntary union recognition through card check agreements. A collective bargaining contract may include a card check arrangement for unorganized branches. A neutrality agreement may be combined with a card check arrangement, where the employer agrees to remain neutral during a union organizing campaign. A union may gain access to company property to meet with employees and distribute literature. Neutrality agreements can cover organizing drives at new branches, and unions may engage in corporate campaigns for card check campaigns. A bargaining order may be issued by the NLRB if unfair labor practices prevent a fair election. According to Feldacker, the NLRB may issue a bargaining order based on specific facts of employer violations. Certification by the NLRB is only granted through a secret ballot election, giving the union advantages such as protection from decertification for a year. Voluntary recognition or a bargaining order do not result in NLRB certification. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on union certification or voluntary recognition. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain for a year. Under voluntary recognition, bargaining is required for a reasonable period. An employer can withdraw recognition if no contract is reached after good faith bargaining. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. An employer could withdraw recognition if no contract was reached after a reasonable period of time. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required an employer to recognize the union if they did not have good faith doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. The board abandoned this doctrine in 1969, allowing an employer to voluntarily recognize the union if a majority of employees signed authorization cards. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. The NLRB has recently reviewed cases of voluntary recognition, such as the UAW's agreements with Metaldyne and Dana corporations in 2003. In 2003, the UAW and employers in the Dana and Metaldyne cases entered card check and neutrality agreements before collecting authorization card signatures, validated by a neutral third party. Employees filed decertification petitions after UAW recognition but before a contract agreement. Regional NLRB directors dismissed the petitions citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. The NLRB reviewed the dismissals after employees petitioned, represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation. The board questioned if voluntary recognition should prevent decertification petitions within a reasonable time after a card check agreement. In 2007, the board issued a decision stating that after voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a petition for decertification or representation election. If no petition is filed within 45 days, an election petition cannot be filed during the recognition bar period. In 2011, the board reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases. In 2003, Lamons Gasket and the United Steelworkers entered a card check agreement, and in 2009, Lamons Gasket voluntarily recognized the USW as the sole representative. A decertification petition was filed within 45 days, leading to a board decision overruling previous cases. The NLRB board decision overruled previous Dana and Metaldyne cases, reinstating a rule that bars election petitions for a reasonable period after voluntary recognition. The reasonable period is defined as at least six months but not more than a year after the first bargaining session. The board will follow standards from the Lee Lumber case to determine the time frame. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested case lists related to the decision. After a union and employer enter into a collective bargaining agreement, election petitions are subject to a \"contract bar\" of up to three years. In a case involving Shaw's Supermarkets, the employer withdrew recognition of the union after three years of a five-year contract, leading to an appeal to the NLRB. Current rules prevent either the employer or the incumbent union from initiating an election petition during the contract duration. The NLRB ruled that Shaw's Supermarkets could withdraw recognition of the union during the five-year contract term, based on evidence of a loss of majority support. If a union and employer cannot reach a collective bargaining agreement, it may lead to an impasse and potential work stoppage through a strike or lockout. A neutral third party can help a union and employer reach a contract agreement instead of resorting to a strike or lockout. Mediation involves a mediator assisting the parties in reaching an agreement without imposing a settlement. Arbitration allows an arbitrator to decide on resolving issues, either in grievance or contract arbitration for existing or new contracts. Interest arbitration can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer. Arbitration can take different forms: voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between the complete final offers of the employer and union or between the final offers from each side on each issue. Voluntary interest arbitration is when the union and employer agree to use arbitration, while compulsory arbitration is required by law. In conventional arbitration, the arbitrator decides on a final contract agreement, which may be a compromise or choose the final offer from either party. Final-offer arbitration requires the arbitrator to choose either the union's or the employer's final offer. The arbitrator may choose the complete final offer (package) of either party or choose between final offers on each issue. Arbitration can take different forms, such as binding or nonbinding. In binding arbitration, the arbitrator's decision is imposed on both parties, while in nonbinding arbitration, parties may choose to accept or reject the decision. Med-Arb combines mediation and arbitration, where a neutral party facilitates an agreement and becomes the arbitrator if no settlement is reached. Interest arbitration is used in the public sector where striking is limited, while in the private sector, the right to strike can encourage parties to reach a contract agreement. Interest arbitration is used in contract negotiations to avoid strikes or lockouts. It may deter a strike but can also change negotiating behavior. When a bargaining impasse occurs, mediation or arbitration can be used. However, interest arbitration may have a \"chilling\" effect on negotiations. Interest arbitration can impact negotiations by affecting the willingness of parties to engage seriously. It may lead to extreme positions and a reliance on arbitration rather than negotiation for future contracts. Final-offer arbitration is proposed as a solution to the chilling effect of conventional arbitration. Final-offer arbitration is suggested as a way to encourage compromise and settlement in negotiations. It allows the arbitrator to choose between the final offers of the union and employer, potentially leading to a contract settlement. The NLRA does not exempt small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee. Collective bargaining assumes there is more than one employee involved in negotiations. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers affecting interstate commerce and has established administrative standards based on annual sales or revenue. For example, retail businesses need $500,000 in sales, hotels and motels need $500,000 in gross revenue, and nonretail businesses need $50,000 in sales to other states. Private colleges and orchestras need $1 million in revenue, with these standards in effect since August 1, 1959. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 codified the ability to establish jurisdictional standards under Section 14(c)(1) of the NLRA. The Board may decline jurisdiction over labor disputes not affecting interstate commerce, but must assert jurisdiction over disputes meeting the standards in effect since August 1, 1959. Smaller employers not under NLRB jurisdiction may still allow unionization through other means. The NLRA allows for unionization through alternative methods, such as voluntary recognition by employers or third-party supervised secret ballot elections. The GAO estimated that 5 million employees of small employers lacked collective bargaining rights under the NLRA in 2001. Due to unchanged jurisdictional standards, inflation has made it harder for employers to meet these standards, potentially affecting more businesses today. Legislation has been introduced to change current union certification procedures, with proposals for NLRB to certify a union based on majority authorization cards or secret ballot selections. Arguments for secret ballots include concerns about coercion, while proponents of card check certification argue against employer pressure during elections. Research on different certification procedures' effects on union success rates is also reviewed. Research suggests that card check certification may lead to higher union success rates compared to secret ballot elections. Unions argue that card check certification is less costly and results in more unionization drives. However, employers believe that unionization may be costly to employees due to dues and higher wages. Little research has been done on the effects of different certification procedures on unionization levels in the United States. In Canada, union success rates are higher under automatic card check recognition compared to secret ballots. Different provinces have varying laws governing union recognition, with some requiring secret ballot elections. Under card check recognition, a union is automatically recognized if a minimum threshold of employees sign authorization cards, resulting in a higher success rate than under secret ballots. In Canada, union success rates are higher under card check recognition than secret ballots. A study of 171 union organizing campaigns in nine provinces showed a 19 percentage point increase in success rate with card checks. In British Columbia, success rate dropped when mandatory voting was adopted in 1984 but increased when card checks were reinstated in 1993. Ontario saw a higher certification rate with card checks before switching to secret ballots in 1995. The union success rate decreased from 72.7% to 64.3% after switching to secret ballots. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. Elections are typically held within five working days after an application for secret balloting. The study included private and public sector employers but excluded the construction industry. Evidence suggests that card check recognition may be more successful under a neutrality agreement. The study found that union success rates are higher when card check recognition is combined with a neutrality agreement, with a success rate of 78.2% compared to 62.5% with just a card check agreement. Card check campaigns cost less and are quicker than secret ballot elections, leading to higher success rates. Neutrality agreements may reduce employer opposition to unionization. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates, but its impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization is uncertain. Shrinking employment in unionized firms and decertifications could offset any membership increase. Americans generally support unions, with 59% approving and 31% disapproving according to a 2008 Gallup poll. In a 2009 Gallup poll, 53% favor a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 39% oppose it. In March 2009, 33% agreed Congress should change the law to make union formation easier, while 40% disagreed. 61% agreed a secret ballot is fair for forming a union. 32% agreed a union should form if a majority signs a card. 57% found it difficult to form a union. A 2006 survey showed 75% prefer a secret ballot for union decisions. A secret ballot election is considered the most fair and democratic way for employees to decide on joining a union, with only 12% preferring card check recognition. A 2005 survey found that 22% of workers felt pressure from management during union organizing campaigns, while only 6% felt pressure from the union. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, aiming to improve workers' bargaining power. Governments may intervene in labor markets for various reasons, including protecting workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Governments intervene in labor markets to improve competition, aiming for efficient resource allocation and greater output. Competitive labor markets pay workers based on their contribution to output, with wages reflecting compensating wage differentials for different working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. In labor markets, unions can increase wages and employment in monopsonies, but may reduce total economic output in competitive markets. It is challenging to determine the competitiveness of labor markets due to various factors such as local, regional, national, or international differences, and changes over time. Unions can impact labor markets by reducing earnings inequality, providing workers with a voice in the workplace, and potentially increasing aggregate demand during a recession. The economic impact of unionization may vary based on policymakers' objectives, with unionized workers potentially obtaining higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions through collective bargaining. Collective bargaining through unions can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions for workers. The impact of collective bargaining on economic efficiency depends on the competitiveness of labor markets. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates, while secret ballot elections may decrease them. The effect of these procedures on unionization levels and economic efficiency varies based on the competitiveness of labor markets. Requiring secret ballot elections or card check certification may impact economic efficiency and earnings inequality. The effects of these changes are difficult to predict or measure, depending on the competitiveness of labor markets."
