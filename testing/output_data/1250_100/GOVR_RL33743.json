    "content": "The 112th Congress passed implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. TPA authority allows expedited consideration of trade agreements without amendments. Ongoing trade negotiations include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years, balancing its constitutional authority over trade policy. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows expedited consideration of trade agreements without amendments, providing the President with negotiating leverage. However, the expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal, as trade negotiations have become more complex and partisan. TPA is the result of decades of cooperation and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, reflecting the need for a cooperative flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The congressional-executive partnership on trade policymaking can be strained or strengthened by evolving political and economic conditions and shifting priorities of the two branches. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress authority over the regulation of foreign trade, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. Both branches play a role in developing and executing U.S. trade agreements, with Congress historically setting tariff rates as the main trade policy instrument. During the 1930s, U.S. trade policy was shaped by conflicts between northern manufacturing regions supporting protectionist tariffs and southern commodity exporting regions advocating for low tariffs. The President's role involved negotiating bilateral treaties with most-favored-nation treatment. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed high tariffs, leading to retaliatory measures and worsening the Great Depression. This prompted Congress to enact new trade legislation to address the negative effects of protectionism. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) authorized the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements reducing tariffs within pre-approved levels on an MFN basis. Congress delegated expanded trade agreements authority to the President to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applied to imports from countries not receiving MFN status. Under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, Congress authorized the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements. This authority was renewed 11 times until 1962, leading to a decline in general tariff levels. The establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947 shifted trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions for five years, with Congress playing a more active role in the process. The GATT Kennedy Round (1963-1967) allowed the President to conclude tariff reduction agreements and address nontariff barriers. Congress raised concerns about the President exceeding authority when negotiating customs valuation and antidumping agreements. The Kennedy Round highlighted the increasing importance of nontariff barrier rules in trade agreements, leading to the creation of fast track authority. Congress sought legislative remedies to address concerns over presidential encroachment on its authority, eventually granting new negotiation authority in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 stipulated that nontariff barrier agreements required implementing legislation from Congress to enter into force. Some in Congress argued that subjecting these agreements to ordinary debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose of delegating trade authority to the President. The Senate Finance Committee report emphasized the need for negotiated agreements to receive an up-or-down vote by Congress to provide assurances to U.S. trading partners. The Trade Act of 1974 allowed for expedited treatment of trade agreements by suspending ordinary legislative procedures in Congress. This included limited time for committees to consider implementing bills, time-limited debate on the floor with no amendments, and consultation with relevant committees by the executive branch. The act also increased the number of Congressional advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. This \"fast track\" trade negotiating authority led to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT in 1979, resulting in agreements on nontariff barriers. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979, resulting from the Tokyo Round agreements, addressed NTBs like government procurement practices, product standards, customs regulations, and antidumping procedures. It was the first trade bill passed under expedited procedures and extended fast track negotiating authority until 1980, with residual authority until 1982. Congress has revised these provisions over the years. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until 1988. It added trade agreements authority for bilateral free trade agreements, including U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. Expedited procedures were required for FTA negotiations, with notification to Congress and denial of expedited procedures if committees disapproved within 60 days. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, but limited expedited procedures to agreements before June 1, 1991. Congress could withhold fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the USTR failed to consult adequately. In 1993, Congress passed legislation extending trade negotiation authority for NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of the GATT until April 16, 1994. The authority was not renewed until the Trade Act of 2002, marking the longest hiatus since fast track was first approved in 1974. In 1997 and 1998, attempts to renew fast track authority were unsuccessful. In September 1998, the House failed to pass fast track authority legislation (180-243), as Congress could not agree on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations in 1999 also contributed to the lack of support for renewing trade agreements authority. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, which was renamed \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" to counter negative connotations. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act (BTPA) of 2002 renewed fast track authority, now called Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), with new provisions for labor and environmental objectives. TPA did not require enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The legislation passed in the House by a narrow margin, mostly along party lines. The Trade Act of 2002 renewed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). It passed with a vote of 66 to 30 in Congress. The legislation included implementing agreements for Free Trade Agreement countries and introduced the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) in 2015. TPA-2015, a substitute amendment to H.R. 1314, was passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37. It includes updated negotiating objectives on various trade areas and will expire on July 1, 2021. TPA-2015 may be used for ongoing negotiations such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), and Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives in trade negotiations, establish terms for entering into trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's authority over trade. This includes negotiations such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) sets limits on trade agreements authority, including procedural precedents outside the formal legal process. Initially, trade agreements focused on reducing tariffs through presidential proclamation. However, with the inclusion of nontariff barriers (NTBs), Congress established \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" to oversee agreements requiring changes to domestic law. This expedited process, known as TPA, streamlines the passage of implementing legislation for trade agreements. Under Section 2103 of the Trade Act of 2002, Congress provides expedited procedures for qualifying trade implementing bills that meet certain conditions. These conditions include progress in meeting TPA's negotiating objectives, notification and consultation requirements, approval of the agreement and administrative action, and necessary changes to laws for implementation. Congress emphasizes its control over trade agreement approval and implementation through these expedited procedures. In a trade implementing bill, Congress grants the President authority to enforce an agreement through a presidential proclamation, after ensuring the partner country has complied with the agreement's provisions. The Trade Act of 2002 outlines specific requirements for this authority, including notifying Congress 90 days before signing, providing a list of necessary changes to U.S. law within 60 days of signing, and transmitting the final legal text of the agreement to Congress after it is signed. The Trade Act of 2002 outlines requirements for a trade implementing bill, granting the President authority to enforce agreements. Congress must be notified before signing, changes to U.S. law must be listed, and the final legal text transmitted after signing. If Congress is satisfied, expedited legislative procedures are followed, including mandatory introduction of the bill, limited debate, and no discharge from committees. The Trade Act of 2002 grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements, with Congress setting requirements for a trade implementing bill. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. These objectives guide the President in trade negotiations, with Congress establishing overall and principal objectives for trade agreements. The Trade Act of 2002 grants the President authority to enforce trade agreements, with Congress setting requirements for a trade implementing bill. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade for U.S. foreign economic and security policy. These objectives guide the President in trade negotiations, with Congress establishing overall and principal objectives for trade agreements, including reducing barriers to trade, protecting intellectual property rights, and ensuring environmental and labor law enforcement. The language defining trade negotiating objectives has been contested in the past, contributing to the 2002 renewal controversy around TPA. The controversy surrounding TPA negotiating objectives highlights their significance as a template for future trade agreements. The labor provisions, a key focus in these objectives, have sparked debates in Congress, particularly regarding enforceable standards. The structure of trade agreements based on TPA objectives has withstood challenges, making the renewal of TPA authority a critical trade vote for Congress. The trade agreements authority is extended to the President with the requirement of regular consultation with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups. Notification and consultation procedures have been revised with each renewal of authority, detailing specific timelines for notifications before and after negotiations. The President must follow specific procedures when entering into trade agreements, including notifying Congress at least 90 days prior, consulting with relevant committees, submitting reports, providing details to the USITC, and releasing the agreement text 60 days before signing. The congressional consultation process under TPA requires the USTR to consult with Congress 60 days before entering into an agreement. The effectiveness of this process has been questioned, with concerns raised about the limited time for input, briefings instead of consultations, and last-minute changes to draft FTA texts. Staff expressed concern that the consultation process for trade agreements did not satisfy many in Congress, leading to calls for greater and earlier congressional input. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays in trade implementing bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners. However, Congress did not surrender its constitutional authority over trade matters and included provisions in TPA to limit the use of expedited procedures. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills for a limited time to ensure congressional oversight. TPA-2015 extends these procedures until July 1, 2021, with no deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the expiration of the authority. The President must request an extension of TPA authority, which can be granted unless Congress adopts a disapproval resolution. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills until July 1, 2021. A resolution of disapproval must be reported out of either the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. Congress can deny expedited procedures if dissatisfied with the President's trade agreement negotiations. The President must fulfill consultation and reporting obligations to preserve the congressional role in trade agreements. Congress can adopt a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution if the President fails to meet these requirements. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill for failure to notify or consult. The Trade Act of 1974, as amended, provides expedited procedures for trade implementing bills, which can be changed by either house of Congress. Cooperation between legislative and executive branches is crucial for the success of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Previous lack of cooperation strained the trade legislative process. The Trade Act of 1974 provides expedited procedures for trade implementing bills, with cooperation between legislative and executive branches crucial for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been absent since 1993, with Congress following certain procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills. This includes reviewing the trade agreement before introducing the implementing bill, holding hearings, informal markup sessions, and mock conferences. The White House sends an informal draft of the trade agreement to Congress for review and feedback. Committee members can raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the final implementing bill. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in markups between committees. The Administration may make clarifications or translations of key points in the final bill, but can choose whether to accept Congress's suggested changes. The Bush Administration declined to include an amendment supported by the Senate Finance Committee in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation, citing TPA requirements. This led to a bipartisan call for better consultation before entering into trade agreements. Congress has at times added side agreements or side letters to trade agreements, such as the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Side letters clarify specific issues in bilateral FTAs. Side letters are common in bilateral FTAs to address specific congressional concerns. They do not change the agreement's text and require official signatures from all negotiating parties. Enforceability is untested. Informal commitments from the executive branch have been relied upon by Congress to address special interests. TPA expired in 2007, and it has been customary for the President to request its renewal. President Obama was criticized for delaying this request. President Obama faced criticism for delaying the request for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal, which he eventually made in 2013 and reiterated in 2015. Congress may consider revamping the 2002 law to reflect current trade policy debates. TPA helps build consensus between branches, signals support for FTAs, and ensures congressional involvement in trade policy decisions. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal is crucial to signal congressional support for FTAs and define negotiating objectives. Timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until negotiations are near completion while others argue for early action. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has expanded, making some objectives outdated. Congress needs to consider these factors when deciding on TPA renewal. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal is important for defining negotiating objectives for FTAs. Current negotiations include new issues like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade effects on small businesses. The treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements has been a controversial topic, leading to partisan votes in the past. The \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 made significant changes to address concerns about labor and the environment. In 2007, the \"May 10th Agreement\" introduced changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Some Democrats support incorporating these changes into future trade agreements, while some Republicans have reservations. TPA-2015 includes key provisions from the May 10th Understanding on labor and environmental issues. Congress is debating whether to include these commitments in formal trade negotiating objectives. Some Members express dissatisfaction with the executive branch's handling of trade negotiation consultations required under TPA, especially regarding the TPP negotiations. Key issues include defining procedures for Congress to influence FTAs early in the process and access to draft texts. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures due to concerns about limited access compared to business and NGO representatives. Members stress the importance of being kept current on trade agreement negotiations to influence the text and participate in drafting implementing bills. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade partner commitments. The United States enforces trade agreements with efforts like the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center. Congress may need to address trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Technical issues with TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress may need reevaluation, including defining \"necessary or appropriate\" language more precisely. Some Members argue for more flexibility in applying this standard. Some argue for flexibility in applying trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills and changes in FTA text raise concerns about TPA renewal addressing these issues. The power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political agreement between Congress and the President. Congress has options for renewing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), including renewing and revising TPA authority, extending TPA for specific agreements like the TPP, or granting permanent TPA authority. Congress has the option to grant the President permanent fast track/TPA authority in a two-tier procedure. This could involve enacting permanent fast track procedures into law and requiring Congress to pass a resolution before specific negotiations begin. The lack of TPA could delay action on trade agreements, but trade policy can still progress through other means. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about giving up congressional authority. In the 114th Congress, legislation to renew TPA was signed into law, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, maintaining the basic structure of previous TPA/fast-track laws. Changes include increased requirements for executive branch consultation with Congress and private sector advisers. The bills outline trade negotiating objectives, covering various topics like trade in goods, services, intellectual property, and new issues such as digital trade and human rights. The new provisions in the legislation reauthorize TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, outlining trade negotiating objectives including currency, human rights, and capacity building. The process involves mock markups by congressional committees before the President sends the final legal draft text of the trade agreement to Congress. The draft implementing bill for a trade agreement is sent to Congress during a session. Identical bills must be introduced in both houses of Congress and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill, or it is automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on the bill. Once reported, any Member can motion to consider the bill with limited debate and no amendments allowed. The implementing bill for a trade agreement is sent to Congress during a session. Identical bills must be introduced in both houses and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill, or it is automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on the bill. A bill passes by simple majority under the statute, and both houses ultimately act on the same measure before it is presented to the President for implementation. The trade agreement's entry into force is contingent on exchanging notes with the trading partner government on or after a specific date."
