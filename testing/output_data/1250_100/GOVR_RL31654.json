    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened,\" with legal tools available for recovery and habitat protection. Prohibited actions include unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species, and agencies must ensure their actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species were listed as endangered or threatened. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species were listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States. The ESA has been amended multiple times since its inception, with funding authorization expiring in 1992 but still receiving appropriations. The ESA aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered species, but can also be a point of contention in debates over land and resource allocation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats. Economic interests can lead to conflicts over resource allocation, such as the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest controversies. The polar bear symbolizes the global debate on climate change. Tensions over the ESA have risen with species additions and economic growth impacting habitats. Congress and the executive branch have worked to address these tensions by tailoring the ESA for specific circumstances. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats. Tensions arise over the ESA's application, with critics arguing for more accommodation of needs beyond species conservation, while defenders believe it balances biases towards development in other laws. Debate on the ESA divides along demographic lines, with stronger support for conservation in urban and suburban areas compared to rural regions. Native Americans, often reliant on natural resources, frequently support listed species' survival. Job loss is a key argument on both sides of the debate regarding conservation measures. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is debated among various groups, with ethical and religious considerations playing a role. Different industries have differing views on the ESA, with questions raised about its funding and enforcement. Congressional appropriations for ESA activities are a point of contention, especially regarding the effect of a lack of funding for agencies like FWS and NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is still enforceable even though the authorization for appropriations expired in FY1992. The agencies still have the authority to carry out actions and the prohibitions within the act remain in effect. The expiration of the provision authorizing appropriations does not negate the statutory obligations created by the law. Additionally, citizens can still file civil suits under Section 11(g) of the act, regardless of agency funding. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) remains enforceable even without agency funding. Citizen suits can still be filed for prohibited acts, dissuading parties from violating the law. House and Senate rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a measure's legal force. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation. The House and Senate rules enforce distinctions between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in legislation. Special rules can set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waivers for unauthorized appropriations in floor amendments and conference reports. Senate rules also prohibit unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments, with exceptions for conference reports. Points of order enforce these rules, but waivers can be granted by unanimous consent. The effects of a lapse in funding on the Endangered Species Act would impact various activities such as interagency consultations, species listings, critical habitat designations, issuance of permits, inspections of incoming cargo, and fulfillment of obligations under CITES. This could potentially lead to increased lawsuits and hinder the implementation of the ESA. The potential effects of a lapse in funding on the Endangered Species Act include no fulfillment of obligations under CITES, no monitoring of candidate species, no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat, no acquisition of habitat for listed species, no state grants for conservation, and no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions. Previous attempts to end funding for the ESA were made in the past, but were abandoned due to the significant impacts listed above. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has only delisted 34 species due to recovery, with some becoming extinct or delisted for other reasons like scientific reclassification or improved data. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are truly extinct, like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew. Rare species are listed only when severely depleted, making it difficult to confirm their existence. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been successful in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. Some species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection. Scientific information is crucial for ESA actions and enforcement. The scientific background of the ESA includes questions about extinction causes, normalcy, and comparison of current rates to background levels. Habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species are major contributors to species decline. The introduction of nonnative invasive species poses a threat to biodiversity, leading to the decline of many species. Scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background levels, although calculating exact rates is challenging due to the vast number of species on Earth. The estimated total number of species on Earth ranges from 3.5 million to 100 million, with 10-30 million being commonly accepted. Scientists struggle to determine extinction rates due to this uncertainty, but conservative estimates suggest current rates exceed background levels. Various methods indicate that current extinction rates are 100 to 10,000 times higher than normal, comparable to past mass extinction events. Critics often question calculations on extinction rates due to uncertainties in estimating the number of existing species. Biologists argue that similar numbers are found in studies across different groups, suggesting scientifically sound results. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be brought back, but some argue that a return to an equal number of species, even if different, could be considered a form of recovery. Evolution continues, leading to the emergence of new species better adapted to changing conditions. After major extinction events, it may take up to 25 million years for the number of species to recover to similar levels. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA protects all species and subspecies of animals, not just birds and mammals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Recovery to pre-historic species numbers could take several million years based on past extinction and recovery rates. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is given to organisms not classified as animals or plants. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harassment, harm, hunting, and capturing wildlife. The law also addresses habitat modification, with a Supreme Court decision allowing for protection against significant habitat changes that harm wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior oversees most listed species through the Fish and Wildlife Service, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce through the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for species to be listed based on scientific information, with economic considerations only factored into critical habitat determinations. The decision to list a species as endangered or threatened depends on the severity of its decline and threats to its survival. Economic considerations are expressly forbidden in this process, as Congress intended listing to be primarily a scientific question. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" has varied, with courts rejecting the Department of the Interior's narrow interpretation. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a joint interpretation allowing for protection of a species' range. The interpretation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) states that a species' range is significant if a portion's contribution to the species' viability is crucial, even if the species is not currently endangered throughout its range. The determination of listing a species as endangered or threatened must be based on scientific factors, without considering economic impacts. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes the importance of basing decisions on scientific factors alone when listing species as endangered or threatened. The addition of the word \"solely\" in the legislation aims to ensure that non-biological considerations do not influence the listing or delisting process. Economic factors are deemed irrelevant in determining the status of species, with the focus solely on the species' biological status. The Endangered Species Act prohibits the consideration of economic factors when determining if a species should be listed as endangered or threatened. The decision is based solely on scientific factors, and once a species is listed, conservation methods can be chosen to lower costs while still achieving conservation goals. Petitions to change a species' status or delist it must be assessed within 90 days of submission. The Endangered Species Act prohibits considering economic factors when determining species listing. Petitions must be assessed within 90 days for substantial scientific information. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines on listing determinations. Over 160 ESA petitions have been received by FWS, with some requesting listing changes. The Endangered Species Act prohibits considering economic factors when determining species listing. Petitions must be assessed within 90 days for substantial scientific information. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines on listing determinations. Over 160 ESA petitions have been received by FWS, with some requesting listing changes. The conference process for species proposed for listing aims to assist federal agencies in identifying and resolving conflicts early in the planning process. It is less formal than the consultation process for listed species and allows FWS or NMFS to advise agencies on minimizing adverse effects. The agency may opt for a more formal process at the proposed listing stage to avoid duplication of effort later. The Endangered Species Act prohibits considering economic factors when determining species listing. Petitions must be assessed within 90 days for substantial scientific information. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines on listing determinations. The conference stage does not require a limitation on irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. Candidate species must be monitored to prevent significant risks to their well-being. Federal agencies may work to improve a species' status to avoid future listing proposals. Federal agencies and nonfederal landowners can develop candidate conservation agreements with FWS or NMFS to conserve species and avoid future listing proposals. If a species is proposed for listing under the ESA, the Secretary must publish the proposed regulation, notify relevant parties, and hold a public hearing. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing under the ESA. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species. Emergency listings may skip some steps in the normal process. Special regulations can be implemented for threatened species, with tailored protections and recovery measures. Endangered and threatened species receive the same protections under federal regulations. A distinct population segment (DPS) refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species. A DPS is a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species, designated for protection under the ESA. Criteria for DPS designation include discreteness and significance, with special rules for threatened DPS. The gray wolf DPS designations have faced litigation, with courts vacating DPS listings since 2003. NMFS developed ESUs to interpret the ESA's \"distinct population segment\" language, including multiple populations or stocks. The ESU concept, used for salmon and steelhead trout populations, aims to identify important groups of populations. There are 28 ESUs listed as endangered or threatened along the Pacific coast. The concept was created by NMFS for practical and scientific reasons, as distinguishing among thousands of distinct stocks was not feasible. The controversial issue of including hatchery fish in ESUs has been debated. Congress added the concept of experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. Two criteria must be met for reintroduction as an experimental population. Experimental populations authorized by the service must be geographically separate from other animals of the same species. They are treated as essential if in danger of extinction, otherwise considered nonessential and threatened. Special regulations apply, but no critical habitat is designated for nonessential populations. Delisting, uplisting, or downlisting processes are the same as for other endangered species. The process for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting endangered species involves the Secretary of the Interior initiating a change in status or reviewing a petition. Decisions must be based solely on scientific data, without considering economic impacts. Every five years, listed species are reviewed for potential status changes. Critical habitat includes areas essential for conservation beyond the species' original geographic range. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, or 47.5% of the 1,596 listed domestic animal and plant species. Critical habitat can be designated for any area, but private land is only affected if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid harming critical habitat. The Secretary must consider scientific data, economic impact, and other relevant factors when designating critical habitat. Areas may be excluded if benefits outweigh designation, but extinction risk must be considered. Economic factors are not considered in listing a species as endangered, but are in critical habitat designation. Adverse modification of critical habitat is mainly a concern for federal agencies, not private landowners. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) imposes restrictions on private land use primarily through prohibitions on taking listed species. Amendments to the ESA specify that critical habitat cannot be designated on Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans, considering national security. This was in response to concerns about critical habitat interfering with military activities. The Endangered Species Act restricts private land use to protect listed species. Critical habitat designation on military lands interferes with training activities. Funding restrictions have hindered the Fish and Wildlife Service's ability to designate critical habitat, leading to lawsuits. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has faced lawsuits for not designating critical habitat, which they believe offers limited protection compared to listing species. They argue that the cost of designation outweighs the conservation benefits, especially if the public sees it as the main regulatory impact of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). However, critical habitat designation can provide additional protection for species in federal actions, as agencies must consider if their actions will harm designated habitat. FWS previously disagreed that this extra protection is significant, stating that harm to habitat would also endanger the species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faced lawsuits for not designating critical habitat, arguing that the cost outweighed the conservation benefits. However, critical habitat designation can provide additional protection for species in federal actions. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" was changed in February 2016 to focus on the recovery goal of the Endangered Species Act. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" in the Endangered Species Act now emphasizes the act's focus on recovery. It refers to alterations that diminish critical habitat value for listed species, including those that affect essential physical or biological features. Recovery plans are required for listed species, but lack detail and are not binding on federal agencies. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species, and land acquisition for conservation purposes can be funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) can be used for land acquisition, funded primarily by offshore oil and gas leases. The fund requires cooperation with states for endangered species conservation, with federal funds available for programs meeting standards. States must provide a 25% match for federal funds, with a fund created in 1988 for state grants. Congress appropriated $53.5 million in FY2016 for cooperative activities with states and territories. Federal actions affecting listed species require approval from the Secretary. Federal actions funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) may impact listed species, requiring a biological assessment (BA) to determine the need for formal consultation. Consultation with FWS or NMFS ensures actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat. A Section 7 consultation is initiated for activities authorized, funded, or carried out by federal agencies. If no jeopardy is found, a biological opinion (BiOp) is issued, along with an incidental take statement. The Endangered Species Act requires consultation with FWS or NMFS for federal actions impacting listed species. If no jeopardy is found, a BiOp is issued with an incidental take statement. The BiOp must be based on the best available scientific and commercial data and may suggest alternatives to avoid harm to species. Consultations usually result in no jeopardy opinions or offer reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary must complete consultation within 90 days for a federal action, with the option to extend to 150 days. Formal consultation may take a year or more. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or apply for an exemption. Exemptions are only available for actions, not species, and require approval from a high-level Endangered Species Committee. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) composed of federal officials and state representatives, known as the \"God Squad,\" decides on exemptions for actions that may harm a species. The ESC requires at least five votes to pass an exemption and follows strict rules and deadlines. The Secretary of Defense can grant an exemption for national security reasons, and the President can exempt projects in disaster areas. The process has been invoked six times, as detailed in the Appendix. To be eligible for an exemption under the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies and nonfederal applicants must have conducted required consultations in good faith. They must also make efforts to consider modifications or alternatives that would not harm endangered species or their habitats. Additionally, they must refrain from irreversible commitments of resources to allow for the formulation of alternative solutions. These requirements ensure a meaningful exemption process without preempting consideration of important issues. The Endangered Species Act outlines specific criteria for granting exemptions for projects or activities that may impact endangered species or their habitats. The process involves considering alternatives, weighing the benefits of the action against conservation goals, and ensuring no irreversible commitments of resources have been made. Special provisions apply in certain circumstances, such as international treaty obligations or national security concerns. The exemption process is complex and does not have a general provision for emergency conditions. The exemption process for projects impacting endangered species under the Endangered Species Act is complex and time-consuming, taking up to 280 days. Funding for mitigation measures is required, and the burden of conservation may fall heavily elsewhere. Exempting an action does not exempt the species, and other statutory obligations may still apply, making it difficult for actions to proceed. The consultation process offers federal agencies opportunities to modify actions to avoid harming species or habitats. Private parties may obtain permits for incidental take of species for lawful actions without a federal nexus. The applicant must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact minimization and mitigation steps. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) includes provisions for funding mitigation, considering alternatives, and specifying prohibited acts such as taking endangered species and regulating trade. The consultation process allows federal agencies to modify actions to avoid harm to species or habitats, while private parties can obtain permits for incidental take with a habitat conservation plan. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits acts that harm endangered or threatened species, with exceptions for permits like incidental take permits. Violators may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators or those involved in importing/exporting wildlife. Criminal violations may also apply. Enforcement provisions are outlined in the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows any person to sue in federal court to enforce ESA provisions, including compelling the Secretary to act on listing-related duties. The court can award litigation costs and attorneys' fees. Citizen suits have driven ESA history, pushing agencies to focus on species conservation. Studies show citizen proposals often involve species in conflict with development. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows citizen suits to list species or challenge listing delays against FWS and NMFS. ESA implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the US, focusing on species protection and international trade. CITES categorizes species based on extinction risk and trade control, while ESA also addresses habitat loss. Violations of CITES are US law violations within US jurisdiction. The Western Hemisphere Convention aims to establish nature reserves, control wildlife trade, and protect wildlife, aligning with ESA goals. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aligns with international treaties like CITES for wildlife conservation. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) under CITES, responsible for ensuring trade does not harm species. The Secretary enforces export determinations based on biological information and manages legal exports and imports under CITES. Certain Management Authority responsibilities are outlined in CITES and the ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species without permission. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission, keep records, and use designated ports. The Endangered Species Committee made decisions on exemptions for projects like Grayrocks Dam impacting endangered species like whooping cranes. The Endangered Species Committee granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir in Wyoming, despite concerns for whooping crane habitat downstream. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition due to the endangered snail darter, leading to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarifying the reach of the ESA. In response to the endangered snail darter, the ESC denied an exemption for the Tellico Dam, but Congress directed its completion. The ESC also granted exemptions for some Bureau of Land Management timber sales, leading to controversy and eventual withdrawal of sales. Additionally, the Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, but no decision was made by the ESC. The Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, but further action on this application appears to have been discontinued in 1982. Consolidated Grain and Barge Company sought to build a docking area for barges at Mound City, IL, but withdrew the application in 1986 after a jeopardy opinion. The Suwanee River Authority's project to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the application was withdrawn in 1986."
