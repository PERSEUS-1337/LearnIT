    "content": "Recent media reports suggest movement in negotiations on amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in the 110th Congress. Oversight activities have included hearings and requests for information on warrantless surveillance programs. A National Intelligence Estimate highlighted the evolving threat from Islamic terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda. The Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need to modernize FISA. Admiral McConnell emphasized the need for modernization of intelligence collection to respond to technological changes and threats to the United States. He proposed changes including not requiring a court order for foreign intelligence gathering from overseas targets and providing liability protection for aid to government efforts. The Protect America Act of 2007 was enacted with a 180-day sunset provision to address these concerns. On January 29, 2008, the House and Senate passed H.R. 5104, a 15-day extension to the sunset for the Protect America Act. This allowed more time to consider amendments to FISA while ensuring the intelligence community's authority. The bill became P.L. 110-182. The House rejected H.R. 5349 on February 13, 2008, which would have extended the sunset provision for an additional 21 days. Various bills were introduced in the Senate to extend the sunset period. The Protect America Act expired on February 16, 2008, but acquisitions authorized during its enforcement remained in effect until their expiration dates. Bills were passed in both the House and Senate to address these concerns, including H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007. The RESTORE Act of 2007 was introduced in the House of Representatives on October 9, 2007, and passed by the House on November 15, 2007. On October 26, 2007, the FISA Amendment Act of 2007 was reported out of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. S. 2248, referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, was reported out with an amendment. A cloture motion was presented and invoked, leading to debate before the Senate broke for the holidays. Activities on S. 2248 resumed in January, with a modified version of the amendment being tabled. Senator Reid sought consideration of the House-passed bill, H.R. 3773. On January 28, 2008, a cloture motion on an amendment to S. 2248 failed to pass in the Senate. Despite various proposed amendments, S. 2248 was eventually passed by a vote of 68-29. The text of S. 2248 was inserted into H.R. 3773, which was then passed and the motion to reconsider was tabled. The House passed H.Res. 1041 two days after the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House and Senate versions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act differ in their treatment of the role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in approving procedures for gathering foreign intelligence information. The House bill requires FISC approval before acquisition of communications of non-U.S. persons believed to be outside the United States. The House bill requires FISC approval for acquisition of communications of non-U.S. persons believed to be outside the United States. The Attorney General and DNI must adopt guidelines for compliance with limitations on acquisitions, with FISC approval needed for certification and procedures. If deficiencies are found, the court will deny the order and provide the government with an opportunity to correct them. In emergency situations, immediate action by the Government may be taken. The DNI may authorize emergency acquisitions without prior FISC approval, with a certification to be submitted within seven days. The Senate bill does not require FISC approval for certifications, targeting procedures, or compliance guidelines, but mandates submission within five days of making or amending them. Immediate action can be taken in emergency situations. The Senate bill allows for emergency acquisitions without prior FISC approval, with a certification to be submitted within seven days. The FISC will approve continued use of procedures if they meet statutory requirements and constitutional standards. If deficiencies are found, the government must correct them within 30 days or cease the acquisition. The House bill clarifies that no application under section 104 of FISA is required for acquisitions targeted at non-U.S. persons outside the United States. The House bill allows for targeting of U.S. persons outside the United States for up to 90 days with FISC approval. Emergency acquisitions require notice to a FISC judge and application within seven days. Acquisition terminates when information is obtained, application is denied, or seven days pass without FISC approval. The House bill allows for targeting of U.S. persons outside the United States for up to 90 days with FISC approval. Without a FISC order, no information acquired from an emergency acquisition involving a U.S. person can be used in evidence or disclosed without consent, except in cases of threat of harm with Attorney General approval. The House and Senate bills differ on the exclusivity of FISA for electronic surveillance. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 and the House bill both aim to expand the definition of \"foreign power\" and \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to address groups or individuals involved in international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Both bills also allow federal officers conducting electronic surveillance to coordinate with law enforcement personnel for investigations. The House and Senate bills aim to expand FISA to address international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They differ on retroactive immunity for electronic communication service providers aiding in warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The Senate provides retroactive immunity, while the House does not. The House bill includes provisions for auditing the Terrorist Surveillance Program, establishing a Commission on Warrantless Electronic Surveillance, and providing additional resources for the FISC. The Senate amendment does not address these issues. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3773 does not address the issue of applications to the FISC. A detailed comparison of the provisions of the two measures is provided, using H.R. 3773 as passed by the Senate as the basis. A glossary of FISA terms is attached to aid in understanding the bills' language. An \"agent of a foreign power\" is defined as a person who acts on behalf of a foreign government, engages in clandestine intelligence activities, or participates in international terrorism. This definition includes individuals who gather intelligence for a foreign power in violation of US laws. An \"agent of a foreign power\" engages in clandestine intelligence activities for a foreign power, including sabotage, international terrorism, and entering the US under false identity. International terrorism involves violent acts intended to intimidate or coerce. The definition of \"foreign intelligence information\" includes information related to protecting the United States from attacks, sabotage, and clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or their agents. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" in relation to acquiring information about a foreign power or territory, emphasizing the need for national defense and security or foreign affairs. It outlines the specific circumstances under which electronic surveillance can be conducted on communications involving United States persons. The curr_chunk defines \"electronic surveillance\" in specific circumstances where privacy expectations are involved, requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. It also clarifies the term \"Attorney General\" and outlines minimization procedures for electronic surveillance. The curr_chunk outlines procedures for electronic surveillance to minimize acquisition and dissemination of nonpublic information concerning US persons, except for crime evidence for law enforcement purposes. The curr_chunk explains procedures for electronic surveillance regarding US persons, ensuring that their communication contents are not disclosed, disseminated, or retained for more than 72 hours without a court order or threat determination by the Attorney General. It defines \"United States person\" and \"United States\" geographically. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to electronic surveillance, including \"aggrieved person,\" \"wire communication,\" \"person,\" \"contents,\" and \"state.\""
