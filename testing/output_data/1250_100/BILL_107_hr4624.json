    "content": "The \"Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 2002\" is the short title of this Act. It states the policy and findings related to nuclear threats. The \"Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 2002\" outlines the policy of the United States to cooperate with Russia in preventing the diversion of weapons of mass destruction and materials. It emphasizes the importance of reducing nuclear warheads, weapons materials, and implementing programs to prevent proliferation. The Act also highlights the need for comprehensive inventory creation to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The United States and Russia aim to create an inventory and exchange data on nuclear weapons-grade material. There should be a clear plan for implementing reductions in nuclear arsenals agreed upon by Presidents Bush and Putin. The US should maintain the moratorium on nuclear tests, with Congress being informed 12 months in advance if testing is to resume. TITLE I--COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WAIVER AUTHORITY\n\nSEC. 101. COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WAIVER AUTHORITY.\n\nSection 1203 of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 is amended to allow the President to waive restrictions on national security grounds.\n\nTITLE II--DATA EXCHANGE WITH RUSSIA RELATING TO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION\n\nSEC. 201. STATEMENT OF POLICY. SEC. 201. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The United States aims to establish comprehensive inventories and exchanges of weapons-grade nuclear materials, tritium, and warheads with Russia, prioritizing tactical nuclear warheads. SEC. 202. Communication of restricted data is amended to include tritium in subparagraph (A), tactical weapons and warheads in subparagraph (B), and data on tritium in subparagraph (D). Subparagraph (B) is added for reciprocal exchange of information. Annual report required by the President to Congress on the progress of implementing section 201 of the Act. Reports must be submitted in both unclassified and classified formats. The reporting requirement ends when the comprehensive inventory is completed and information is exchanged between the US and Russian governments. Authorization of appropriations for expanded non-proliferation funding. In fiscal year 2003, $600 million is authorized for the Department of Defense, with $180 million for chemical weapons destruction in Russia. The Department of Energy is allocated $1.4 billion, including funds for defense nuclear nonproliferation and weapons activities. In fiscal year 2003, $300 million is allocated for the Department of State. TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO THE NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW\n\nCongress supports the President's objective, as stated in the Nuclear Posture Review dated January 2002, for maintaining a number of operationally deployed nuclear warheads at a level of 1,700 to 2,200 by fiscal year 2012. The Secretary of Energy is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the number and posture of nuclear warheads, including those operationally deployed, in the responsive force, in the reserve force, and scheduled for dismantling. Additionally, a report on options for achieving the President's objective for operationally deployed nuclear warheads before fiscal year 2012 is also mandated. The Secretary of Energy must report to Congress within 90 days of this Act on options for maintaining 1,700 to 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads before fiscal year 2012. The report should assess the effects on cost, environmental compliance, dismantlement workforce, and relations with Russia. Additionally, there is a moratorium on underground testing of nuclear weapons. The moratorium on underground testing of nuclear weapons by the United States will continue through fiscal year 2003. The President must notify Congress at least 12 months before conducting a test, providing the date, certification of national security necessity, and expected international reactions. The Secretary of Energy must report to Congress by March 1, 2003, on options to reduce the time needed for an underground test after a decision is made. The Department of Energy conducted a study in fiscal year 2002 on reducing the time needed for an underground nuclear test. The Secretary assessed the feasibility of reducing the time to less than 24 to 36 months, considering technical challenges and costs from 2003 to 2012."
