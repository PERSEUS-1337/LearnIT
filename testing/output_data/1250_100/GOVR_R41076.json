Other major programs aiding lower-income households in 2009 included Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, SSI, and EITC payments. The Administration's FY2011 budget requests continued growth in federal spending on food assistance, with significant increases in SNAP participation and spending. SNAP provides low-income households with monthly benefits to supplement food spending, with participation reaching 38.2 million persons in November 2009. Monthly spending on SNAP benefits rose from $3.6 billion in November 2008 to $5.1 billion in November 2009, with total estimated spending for FY2010 at least $69 billion. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) saw an increase in participation to almost 41 million persons in FY2009, up from 33.7 million in the previous year. TEFAP provides food commodities to emergency feeding organizations, with USDA donations making up 20%-25% of the food distributed. In FY2009, TEFAP provided $710 million worth of commodities and $89 million in distribution cost assistance. Feeding America reported a 21% increase in food distribution between June 2008 and June 2009. However, TEFAP support may decrease in FY2010 due to the expiration of extra funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The School Lunch and School Breakfast programs provide cash subsidies and USDA-acquired commodities to schools for providing meals to low-income children. Between November 2008 and November 2009, the number of children receiving free lunches and breakfasts increased significantly. In FY2009, child nutrition programs cost $15.4 billion, with estimates for FY2010 reaching $17 billion. The WIC program offers nutrition vouchers to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, and infants. The WIC program provides vouchers for nutrition supplemental foods to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children. Participation increased by 2.3% between November 2008 and November 2009, with costs totaling $6.5 billion in FY2009. The USDA's Economic Research Service reported that 14.6% of American households were \"food insecure\" in 2008, with 5.7% experiencing \"very low food security\". In 2008, 14.6% of American households were \"food insecure\" with 5.7% experiencing \"very low food security\". In 2009, food hardship rates ranged from 17.9% to 18.8%. Congress and the Administration made changes to SNAP funding and eligibility in response to the economic downturn in 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded SNAP benefits and eligibility. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) expanded SNAP benefits and eligibility, increasing monthly allotments based on the cost of a minimally adequate diet. This included suspending time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents and providing extra federal funding for administrative costs. The ARRA also raised SNAP benefits by 13.6% in April 2009 to account for unanticipated food-price inflation and other needs of recipient households. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) increased SNAP benefits by 13.6% in April 2009, boosting monthly household benefits by up to 20%. ARRA-provided SNAP benefits totaled $4.3 billion in FY2009 and over $800 million in November 2009. The law suspended time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents during high unemployment rates. The ARRA suspended time limits on SNAP eligibility for those unable to find a job through FY2010. States share administrative costs with the federal government, with $3 billion annually covered by states. The ARRA provided additional federal funding for administrative expenses in FY2009 and FY2010. The minimum FY2010 funding for SNAP is set at $53 billion, with a $5 billion increase from FY2009. Additional funding is expected under the ARRA provisions. The Administration has taken steps to expand access to SNAP by allowing unlimited funding for emergency requirements and providing an extra $400 million for state administrative expenses. The USDA encourages states to use \"categorical eligibility\" authority to increase household eligibility by lifting asset and income limits. States can also receive waivers for face-to-face interviews for eligibility determination and recertification. In FY2009, TEFAP was budgeted at $250 million in commodities and $50 million for distribution/storage costs, with an additional $150 million made available through FY2010. The ARRA also allocated $6 million for infrastructure improvement expenses. Child nutrition programs received $100 million for school food service equipment grants. The FY2010 Agriculture Department appropriations law (P.L. 111-80) allocated $17 billion for child nutrition spending and included provisions to expand participation in child nutrition programs. This included adding three states and the District of Columbia to receive federal subsidies for after-school program suppers. $25 million was appropriated for grants to improve direct certification for free school meals and federal technical assistance. Additionally, $400 million was provided for a contingency reserve to support WIC program participation or food costs exceeding budget estimates, with $100 million available for management information systems. The FY2011 budget request includes substantial increases in participation and spending for USDA food assistance programs. SNAP costs are projected to increase by almost $4 billion due to higher participation. Child nutrition initiatives like school meal programs will cost $18.3 billion, and WIC program spending is expected to increase to $7.8 billion. Mandatory funding for TEFAP is set to slightly decrease, but USDA donations of bonus commodities will make up the difference. The budget also includes proposals to change laws governing domestic food assistance programs. The FY2011 budget request proposes changes to domestic food assistance programs, including extending funding authority for SNAP, suspending eligibility rules for ABAWDs, and increasing asset limits. It also suggests adding $1 billion in new spending for child nutrition programs to address childhood hunger and obesity by 2015. The FY2011 budget request proposes changes to domestic food assistance programs, including extending funding authority for SNAP, suspending eligibility rules for ABAWDs, and increasing asset limits. It also suggests adding $1 billion in new spending for child nutrition programs aimed at ending childhood hunger, reducing childhood obesity, improving children's diets, and enhancing program performance."
