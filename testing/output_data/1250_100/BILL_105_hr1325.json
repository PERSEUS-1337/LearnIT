    "content": "The State Administrator shall establish a Problem Resolution Office with officers authorized to investigate taxpayer complaints and halt collection activities if deemed non-compliant with the law. Only the highest official in the relevant taxing authority can reverse such injunctions based on clear evidence. Officers cannot be penalized unless a pattern of unreasonable injunctions is proven. This does not limit legal remedies in court. The Secretary will establish an Office of Revenue Allocation to resolve disputes among states regarding the destination of taxable property for revenue allocation from taxes imposed by this subtitle. The determination of the Administrator of the Office of Revenue Allocation can be reviewed in federal court with the standard of review being abuse of discretion. The destination of property and services for tax purposes is determined as follows: real property is based on its location, other property on the purchaser's residence, services on where they are used, and telecommunications services on the purchaser's residence. Domestic transportation services are based on the final destinations. For tax purposes, the destination of transportation services within the United States is the final destination of the trip. For international transportation services, 50 percent of the service amount is attributed to the United States. Financial intermediation services are based on the purchaser's residence. State Tax Administrators have jurisdiction over gross payments with a destination within their state. Rents and royalties for tangible property are based on the destination. The destination of rents and royalties for the lease of tangible property is where the property is located. For vehicles, rent and lease payments are based on the location where the vehicle was delivered for short-term leases and the residence of the lessee for long-term leases. SEC. 54.

Vending machine sales are exempt from these requirements. Vending machines must dispense taxable property for coins or bills up to twenty dollars and cannot sell items over ten dollars each. The State Administrator or Secretary can enter installment agreements or compromises for tax liabilities. The agreement remains valid unless inaccurate information is provided. Vendors must use the cash method for tax remittance, but can elect the accrual method for invoiced sales.

Tax rates for taxable years ending June 30, 1999, are modified for both calendar year and fiscal year taxpayers. Starting January 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration will collect payroll taxes related to self-employment income and employment taxes. Section 7 of the Act covers revised rules for self-employment tax. For updated withholding tax schedules and family consumption refund rules, refer to section 13. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases of taxable property or services, wages paid for business purposes, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income from prior periods. Transition amounts for the ten calendar years starting in 1999 are calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount related to prior law section 167 property placed in service before January 1, 1999. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases of taxable property or services, wages paid for business purposes, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income from prior periods. Transition amounts for the ten calendar years starting in 1999 are calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount related to prior law section 167 property placed in service before January 1, 1999. Subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c) are repealed, and subsections 1402(d) et seq. are renumbered as subsections 1402(b) et seq. SEC. 8. Social Security benefits indexed on sales tax inclusive basis. Subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) of subsection (i) of section 215 of the Social Security Act is amended to define the 'CPI increase percentage' with respect to Consumer Price Index for base and cost-of-living quarters in any calendar year. The Consumer Price Index and national sales tax factor must exceed the index for the prior base quarter or cost-of-living computation quarter. The national sales tax factor is calculated as one plus the sales tax rate divided by one minus the sales tax rate. Compensating payments to certain persons on fixed income are addressed in Section 9. Compensating payments are provided to eligible persons who comply with the application requirements. The payment is calculated based on the qualified fixed income payment amount and the excess inflation rate. An eligible person is someone who receives Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. Qualified fixed income payments can be received from a defined benefit plan or an annuity contract with an insurance company. Payments under annuity contracts or defined benefit plans must not vary with investment performance, interest rates, or inflation to be considered qualified fixed income payments. An annuity contract entered into after June 30, 1999, does not qualify. Payments from a defined benefit plan to a beneficiary with less than 5 years of participation are also not qualified. The qualified fixed income payment amount is limited to $5,000 per year. The excess inflation rate is determined by the consumer price index. During the 18-month period ending December 31, 2000, compensating payments will be made to eligible individuals, with applications required and payments received alongside Social Security benefits. The funds for compensating payments will come from the general fund, and insurers may be required to issue statements to annuitants or plan participants. Insurers may be required to issue a statement to annuitants or plan participants for determining qualified fixed income payment amount. SEC. 10. INTEREST. Amends section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code by reducing the interest rate. SEC. 11. SUPERMAJORITY REQUIRED TO RAISE RATE. Prohibits any bill that increases federal sales tax rate without a supermajority vote in the House or Senate."
