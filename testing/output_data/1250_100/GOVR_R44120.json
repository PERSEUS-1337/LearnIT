    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel. Differences between the versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report compares highlights of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 passed by both chambers. The President vetoed an earlier version of the FY2016 NDAA due to exceeding defense spending caps. After the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps, the bill was modified to comply with the new limits while keeping military personnel provisions intact. The revised FY2016 NDAA was passed by the House and Senate after the President vetoed an earlier version for exceeding defense spending caps. The bill was modified to comply with new limits while maintaining military personnel provisions. Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for the bill on multiple dates in 2015. Related CRS products provide detailed background information and analysis. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2015 NDAA. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength post-9/11 attacks. However, reductions began in anticipation of troop withdrawals and budget constraints. Air Force and Navy end-strengths have been declining since 2001. The Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 by FY2019. The Administration's request proposed continuing the reduction in Army strength (-15,000 compared to FY2015), with Navy (+5,600), Marine Corps (-100), and Air Force (+4,020) strengths remaining level or increasing. The final bill authorized end-strengths identical to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which was 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill would have repealed 10 U.S.C. 691, allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers below authorized end-strengths. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) allowed for a reduction of National Guard and Reserve personnel by up to 10% for operational support. It also permitted a decrease of up to 2% in active component and Selected Reserve personnel. Section 402 adjusted minimum end-strengths downward and expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to reduce these minimum strengths by up to 2%. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% since September 11, 2001. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% since September 11, 2001, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The largest shifts in authorized end strength between FY2001 and FY2015 have occurred in the Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. Discussion: The Administration proposed changes in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for FY2016, with reductions in Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve, and increases in Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. No change was proposed for Coast Guard Reserve. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) matched the Administration's request. Concerns about military personnel costs and recruiting quality personnel have led to continued focus on military pay raises. The military pay raise for 2016 is determined by a statutory formula indexed to the Employment Cost Index, with a proposed increase of 1.3% in the President's Budget, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The Department of Defense plans to limit pay raises through FY2020, with projected increases of 1.3% in FY 2017, 1.5% in FY 2018 and FY 2019, and 1.8% in FY 2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. The initial Senate version proposed a 1.3% pay increase for lower-ranking servicemembers, but President Obama set the pay raise at 1.3% for all in 2016. The final bill did not include a general pay raise provision, maintaining the 1.3% increase. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include a general pay raise provision, maintaining the 1.3% increase specified by President Obama. The bill also freezes the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to provide recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission delivered its final report and recommendations to Congress on January 29, 2015. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) changes the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. The Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received congressional and media attention, with changes made in previous NDAAs. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military reported unwanted sexual contact experienced by military personnel. In 2014, 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact, with 53% facing social retaliation. This included adverse administrative action (35%), professional retaliation (32%), and punishment for reporting an infraction (11%). The Government Accountability Office highlighted the need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings and sentencing in sex-related offenses. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. By December 3, 2015, all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established gender-neutral occupational standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness, requiring DOD to validate unit-level performance. Changes in assignment policies for females must be notified to Congress, with a shortened waiting period of 30 calendar days for review before implementation. Enhancing personal financial management training programs for military servicemembers could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. This was a finding of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The implementation timeline for these changes could be expedited, benefiting both DOD and Congress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires financial literacy training for military servicemembers at various career points due to life changes or transitions. Statutory requirements for enlistment differ between active and reserve components. The United States has an association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions for enlistment if deemed vital to national interest. Enlistment requirements include being a US citizen, lawful permanent resident, or having previous military service. The enacted bill requires financial literacy training for military servicemembers and distinguishes enlistment requirements between active and reserve components. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provided more generous educational benefits than REAP, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The enacted bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Only those using REAP in the enrollment period immediately prior to the date of enactment could continue to use the program. The initial Senate passed bill (H.R. 1735) would entitle individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to verify their past military service. The card must identify the bearer as a veteran and include their name and a photograph. The Act also authorizes the Secretary of Defense to negotiate with national retail chains to ensure the ID card will be accepted for discounts on services, consumer products, and pharmaceuticals. The enacted bill did not include a provision for a \"Recognition of Service ID Card.\" Veterans can use state-issued ID cards or obtain an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. The Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide an identification card to veterans who demonstrate their military service. The military uses recruiting bonuses and incentives to attract qualified personnel. Chapter 5 of Title 37 of the United States Code contains various bonus and incentive pay authorities. Section 531 of the House-passed bill authorizes service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. Section 522 of the enacted bill incorporates this provision. For more information on recruitment and retention, refer to CRS Report RL32965. When reservists are called into active federal service, they are eligible for legal protections under USERRA, including the right to reemployment. Certain types of duty, such as activations under Full Mobilization and Presidential Reserve Call-Up, are exempt from the five year limit. New mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These activations are not currently exempt from the five year cumulative limit. Activations under new reserve activation authorities are not currently exempt from the five year cumulative limit on military service for reemployment protection under USERRA. Section 565 of the House-passed bill would exempt military duty under these authorities from the limit. Reference CRS Report RL30802 for more information on USERRA and mobilization authorities. Active service is defined as full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also includes periods of active duty for training where injury or death occurred in the line of duty. National Guard and reserves members who are never activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of a veteran. Reservists become eligible for retirement after 20 years of qualifying service. Reservists become eligible for retirement after 20 years of qualifying service, but may not necessarily be considered veterans unless they have completed required active service. The House-passed bill initially proposed honoring reservists who qualify for reserve retirement as veterans, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for personal reasons or career development. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for personal reasons or career development, with an additional active duty service obligation. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. The enacted bill removes prohibitions on program participation by certain members of the Armed Forces and removes restrictions on the number of annual participants. Congress has been concerned with improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 incentivized officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters, tying joint professional military education and service in joint assignments to promotions. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and encourages a dual career track with a primary specialty in combat arms and a sub-specialty in acquisition. The Secretary of Defense is urged to ensure that Phase II joint professional military education includes acquisition matters for successful performance in acquisition fields. Section 1585 of Title 10, United States Code authorizes the Secretary of Defense to prescribe policy and regulations regarding the carrying of firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. Current DOD policies limit the carrying of government-issued firearms on military installations to personnel engaged in assigned duties. Military servicemembers are prohibited from carrying personal firearms on military bases and installations. Recent active shooter incidents have raised questions about force protection measures at military installations. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would give more flexibility to commanders of military installations to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action, including by friendly fire or terrorist attacks. The Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 killed 168 people, including servicemembers, who are ineligible for the Purple Heart. There is debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart due to the nature of the attack. Eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks in 2009. The eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. The law redefined what should be considered an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for purposes of determining eligibility for the Purple Heart. The provision in the initial House-passed bill regarding the Oklahoma City bombing victims was not adopted. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years, with laws enacted to facilitate the adoption of retired MWDs. Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" in 2000 to end the euthanizing of MWDs and allow for their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to include handlers, family members, and classified MWDs as \"equipment.\" Interested individuals paid for transporting the MWDs. The NDAA for FY2013 (P.L 112-239) allowed for the transfer of retiring military working dogs (MWDs) to the United States for adoption. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) now requires DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and prioritize adoption for former handlers. This change from \"may\" to \"shall\" ensures that all MWDs are retired only after being returned to the United States. The FY2013 NDAA allowed for the transfer of retiring military working dogs (MWDs) to the United States for adoption. The current concern is the lack of appropriated funds for the domestic transfer of these dogs. The President's FY2015 budget proposed cuts to the Defense Commissary System, but funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA. The President's FY2016 budget request proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, reducing the budget from $1.3 billion to $400 million in three years. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours for commissary patrons and increased costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retirees, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by March 1, 2016. The plan aims to achieve budget-neutrality by meeting set benchmarks such as customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. The report will include modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, pricing constructs, and impact on MWR programs. The Defense Secretary will consider Section 634 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 and previous reports and studies. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. This is in reference to the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) Final Report. TRICARE is a health care program for military personnel and their families. The Administration proposed changes in FY2016, but most were not adopted. Recommendations for TRICARE changes were made but not endorsed by the President or Congress. Future changes to TRICARE benefits are still possible. The committee recommends a deliberate approach to TRICARE reform legislation to improve access, outcomes, and cost control in the military health system. Comprehensive reform is essential for enhancing care for beneficiaries and maintaining medical readiness. The joint statement commits to working with the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2017 to begin reforming the military healthcare system. The military healthcare system needs to be modernized and improved to meet future needs. Reevaluating all elements of the current system and increasing fees and co-pays are necessary for comprehensive reform. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program with various options for filling prescriptions. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy copayments at military pharmacies. The military pharmacy program offers a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free, with a focus on generic drugs over brand-name ones. There have been proposed increases in copayments for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies, with a one-time increase already implemented. The copay for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies has been increased for generic and brand name drugs, as well as for mail order prescriptions. The estimated reduction in direct spending over 10 years is about $1.5 billion. Discussions in Congress have focused on improving the visibility of health quality metrics in the military health system. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires actions to increase visibility of health quality metrics. CBO estimated $95 million needed over 2016-2020. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control. Access to contraception remains a concern for Service members. TRICARE covers birth control pills, pregnancy tests, and surgical sterilization. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception and counseling for women in the Armed Forces."
