    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2005\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology for advancing human understanding and improving lives. Economic growth is linked to research and development, with basic research exploring the universe and applied research addressing everyday problems. The United States emphasizes the importance of education in promoting economic growth through intellectual capital and innovativeness. It requires scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate individuals to drive research, development, and informed decision-making. Student performance in international assessments reveals areas for improvement in education programs. The International Student Assessment highlights the need for improvement in K-12 science and mathematics education in the United States. New teaching methods, better curricula, improved teacher training, and parental involvement are essential. Science education should focus on inquiry, experimentation, and concepts, allowing students to learn by doing. Children's natural curiosity should be nurtured to enhance their learning experience. To improve science education, teachers play a crucial role in connecting students with the content. High-quality teachers should be recruited with incentives to stay in the classroom and continuously improve their teaching practices. Training teachers in their content area, curriculum, and effective teaching techniques is essential for superior results. SEC. 3. Refundable credit for portion of tuition paid for undergraduate education of certain teachers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a refundable credit for tuition for undergraduate education of certain teachers. In the case of an eligible teacher, a tax credit of 10% of qualified undergraduate tuition paid, not exceeding $1,000 per year, is allowed. For teachers in high-needs school districts, the credit can be up to $1,500. The credit is limited to 10 years. Eligibility criteria for teachers are specified. An eligible teacher, for tax purposes, is defined as a full-time teacher in grades K-12 who teaches math, science, engineering, or technology courses. They must have a relevant degree and be highly qualified. The text discusses the qualifications and definitions related to eligible teachers for tax purposes, including the definition of highly qualified teachers and the treatment of school administrative functions. It also defines qualified undergraduate tuition and institution of higher education. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for the implementation of these provisions. Conforming Amendments: Section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding \"or 36\" after \"section 35\". The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is updated. The text discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to tuition for certain teachers and credits for contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level. The effective date for these amendments is specified. The text discusses a tax credit for STEM contributions at the elementary and secondary school level, including school contributions, teacher externship expenses, and teacher training expenses. Qualified STEM contributions are defined as specific types of contributions benefiting STEM education. STEM school contributions encompass property and service contributions. The text outlines criteria for tax deductions on property donations to elementary or secondary schools for educational purposes, emphasizing that the property must align with the school's education plan and not be exchanged for money or other property. The term 'STEM service contributions' refers to payments for STEM services provided to elementary or secondary schools for students' benefit, under specific conditions. 'STEM inventory property' is defined as property meeting certain criteria donated to schools. The term 'STEM services' refers to services needed by schools for education in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics in grades K-12. STEM teacher externship expenses are defined as amounts paid for STEM externship programs by taxpayers. The STEM externship program allows eligible STEM teachers to receive training in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics to enhance their teaching skills. Eligible STEM teachers are individuals teaching in grades K-12 at educational organizations in the United States or on a US military base. The term 'STEM teacher training expenses' refers to costs incurred by a taxpayer in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics for training programs enhancing teaching skills. No double benefit deduction is allowed under this provision. Conforming amendments are made to Section 38(b) of the Code. The text introduces a new paragraph (20) regarding the STEM contributions credit under section 45J. Additionally, amendments are made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code.
