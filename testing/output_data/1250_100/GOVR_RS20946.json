    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. It consists of four parts: A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services; B covers medical services like physician services and outpatient hospital services; C offers private plan options for those enrolled in A and B; and D provides optional prescription drug coverage. Medicare expenditures are driven by factors like enrollment, medical services complexity, health care inflation, and life expectancy. In 2017, Medicare provided benefits to about 58.4 million persons at a cost of $710.2 billion. The program has two trust funds - the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, funded through payroll taxes and general revenue/beneficiary premiums respectively. Financial projections are based on economic assumptions like consumer price index and life expectancy. The HI Trust Fund of Medicare faces projected shortfall and insolvency, funded by payroll taxes and additional taxes on high-income workers. Unlike Social Security, there is no earnings limit for the tax. Premiums from voluntary enrollees also contribute to the fund. The HI Trust Fund of Medicare is a financial account in the U.S. Treasury that operates on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis, funded by payroll taxes and interest on government securities. No actual money is transferred into or out of the fund, and it is solely an accounting mechanism. The General Fund of the Treasury is used for government spending purposes, including payments for Medicare Part A services. When the HI Trust Fund has a surplus, it shows up as assets on the balance sheets, but these surpluses are not reserved for future Medicare benefits. If the HI Trust Fund has a deficit, Medicare can redeem securities accumulated in previous years. In deficit years, Medicare can redeem securities accumulated in previous years to pay for the HI Trust Fund. The fund is deemed insolvent when assets reach zero, but it has never become insolvent. The insolvency date has been postponed through various methods, such as adjusting the payroll tax rate periodically. Efforts to slow HI program spending have been made through budget reconciliation laws, such as the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This legislation improved short-term projections by reducing expenditures and combating fraud. Concerns arose that the savings achieved were greater than intended. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 led to unintended consequences for health care providers, prompting Congress to enact the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 and the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. Despite these measures increasing program spending, the 2001 and 2002 Medicare Trustees Reports delayed the projected insolvency date due to economic growth and lower program costs. However, the 2003 report projected insolvency by 2026, earlier than previously expected, due to lower payroll taxes and higher hospital expenditures. The 2004 report projected the HI Trust Fund would become insolvent in 2019, earlier than expected due to slow wage growth and higher hospital expenditures. The 2005 report revised the insolvency date to 2020, reflecting slightly higher income and lower costs. The 2006 report moved the insolvency date to 2018 due to increased costs and service utilization. The 2007 and 2008 reports projected insolvency in 2019, with the 2008 report indicating an earlier occurrence in the year. The 2009 report projected insolvency of the HI Trust Fund in 2017, moved forward due to the economic recession. The 2010 report estimated depletion in 2029, delayed by the ACA. However, the 2011 report predicted insolvency in 2024, citing lower payroll taxes from high unemployment. The 2012 report maintained the 2024 insolvency date, despite expected payroll tax increases and spending reductions. Despite a 2% reduction in spending required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Medicare trustees projected a better short-term outlook for the HI Trust Fund in their 2013 report, moving the insolvency date to 2026. Subsequent reports in 2014 and 2015 showed further improvement, with the insolvency date pushed to 2030. However, the 2016 report projected a slightly worsened short-term outlook for the HI Trust Fund. The Medicare trustees projected a worsened short-term outlook for the HI Trust Fund in their 2018 report, moving the insolvency date three years earlier to 2026. This change was primarily due to lower-than-expected payroll-tax income and slower wage growth. The HI Trust Fund is facing financial strain due to reduced income and increased expenditures, leading to a projected insolvency date of 2026. Trust fund assets will be used to cover the difference until depletion. The Medicare trustees reported small surpluses in 2016 and 2017, but expenditure growth is expected to outpace income in 2018 and beyond. The fund's purpose is to ensure continued bill payments during financial strain without requiring legislative action. The HI Trust Fund is facing financial strain, with a projected insolvency date of 2026. If the fund becomes insolvent, there are no provisions in place to address the shortfall, such as using general revenues. The Medicare trustees project that by 2026, only 91% of Part A expenses will be covered unless action is taken to increase revenues or decrease expenditures. The financial status of Medicare is a concern, particularly the HI Trust Fund's projected insolvency in 2026. There may be a legislative decision on funding sources to address deficits. As Medicare spending obligations increase, there is a growing reliance on general revenues and beneficiary premiums. The Medicare trustees project an increase in the portion of income taxes needed to fund SMI, from 15.4% in 2017 to 26.3% in 2092. Expenditures have exceeded income since 2008, with assets from the HI Trust Fund used to cover the shortfall. The fund is projected to be depleted in 2026, leading to potential payment issues for Part A expenditures. The Medicare trustees project an increase in income taxes to fund SMI, with historical and projected Medicare financial data through 2027 available in Table A-1. Appendix B provides historical payroll tax rates."
