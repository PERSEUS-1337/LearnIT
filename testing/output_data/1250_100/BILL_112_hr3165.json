    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Positive Behavior for Safe and Effective Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The findings highlight the ineffectiveness of harsh school discipline policies, such as suspension and expulsion, which disproportionately affect students of color and those with disabilities. Research shows that these approaches do not deter misbehavior and can lead to higher rates of future misconduct. The correlation between school discipline and student dropout rates is high. Suspended students are more likely to drop out, engage in delinquent behavior, and enter the criminal justice system. Teachers also leave schools due to discipline issues. Implementing high academic and behavior standards can lead to improved academic outcomes. However, evidence-based practices for improving behavior have not been widely adopted. Effective implementation of school-wide positive behavior supports has been linked to greater academic achievement, fewer disciplinary problems, lower suspension rates, and increased instructional time. Early intervening services have shown to be effective in reducing disciplinary issues and improving academic performance. For example, one elementary school in Illinois saw an 85 percent decrease in out-of-school suspensions and a gain of 386 days of instructional time after implementing these supports. Similarly, a school in Maryland witnessed a decrease in office discipline referrals after implementing early intervening services. Implementing school-wide positive behavior supports in schools has shown significant benefits, such as a 42 percent decrease in office discipline referrals for major rule violations in a Maryland school, resulting in 119 days of instructional time recouped for students and 40 days of administrator time saved within one school year. Additionally, a school in South Carolina saw a 100 percent decline in teacher transfer requests and a 36 percent decrease in teacher absence days when using positive behavior supports. These approaches help create safer teaching environments and support all students, including those with challenging behaviors, in achieving success. The purpose of this Act is to expand the use of school-wide positive behavior supports to improve school climate, reduce discipline referrals, and enhance student academic outcomes. The term \"positive behavior supports\" in this Act refers to a systematic approach to reinforcing desired behaviors and eliminating reinforcement for problem behaviors to achieve social outcomes and increase learning for all students, including those with complex behavioral needs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows for the use of Title I funds to implement school-wide positive behavior supports, including early intervening services for students needing academic and behavioral support in a general education setting. These funds must align with those authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include technical assistance for implementing school-wide positive behavior supports and other effective approaches to improve the learning environment and reduce disciplinary actions that remove students from school. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include technical assistance for implementing school-wide positive behavior supports and reducing disciplinary actions that remove students from instruction. This includes reviewing discipline referrals, school climate, and family engagement to implement early intervening services. LEAs have flexibility to improve school climate. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow LEAs flexibility in improving school climate by implementing school-wide positive behavior supports to enhance academic outcomes and reduce disciplinary actions that remove students from instruction. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow LEAs flexibility in improving school climate by implementing school-wide positive behavior supports to reduce disciplinary actions that remove students from instruction. SEC. 5 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include an understanding of social or emotional learning in teacher preparation to improve school climate. SEC. 6 addresses safe and drug-free schools and communities. The purpose of Section 4002 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is to support programs that improve school climate, prevent discipline problems, reduce suspensions and expulsions, prevent violence and drug use, promote family engagement, and create a safe learning environment. The purpose of Section 4002 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is to provide grants to local educational agencies and consortia to establish, operate, and improve programs related to improving school-wide climate, including implementing positive behavior supports. SEC. 7 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to address the need for early intervening services to improve school climate and reduce disciplinary actions. SEC. 8 focuses on specialized instructional support services. The Secretary of Education oversees programs for specialized instructional support services in schools to improve academic achievement. This includes identifying effective practices, providing training for personnel, and offering technical assistance to schools. The Secretary of Education oversees specialized instructional support services in schools, providing technical assistance, coordinating programs, and ensuring evaluation of effectiveness. Specialized instructional support personnel include school counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other qualified professionals offering necessary services. Specialized instructional support services, overseen by the Secretary of Education, are provided in schools to meet student needs. These services include support from specialized instructional support personnel and other corrective services. SEC. 9. DEFINITION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965. Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a definition of \"family engagement in education\" as a shared responsibility between families and schools for student success from birth through young adulthood. The term 'positive behavior supports' refers to a systematic approach to implementing proven practices for early intervening services, utilizing strategies to reinforce desired behaviors and eliminate reinforcement for problem behaviors to improve social outcomes and enhance student learning."
