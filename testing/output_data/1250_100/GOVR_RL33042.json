    "content": "The creation of DHS in 2002 resulted in a significant reorganization of the executive branch, comparable to the establishment of the Department of Defense in 1947. Legislative compromises led to the complex structure of DHS, with provisions for reorganization by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Secretary Chertoff utilized this authority to implement his plans, while the President had temporary authority to prescribe reorganization plans for DHS within the first 12 months of the Homeland Security Act. In late January 2003, President George W. Bush modified the reorganization plan for DHS to create two new components within the Border and Transportation Security Directorate. DHS was initially organized with various directorates and units reporting directly to the Secretary, including the Coast Guard and Secret Service. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created with various components like the Coast Guard and Secret Service. DHS had around 170,000 employees, with a significant field organization. Secretary Chertoff initiated a review of the department's organization and operations, involving 18 action teams and over 250 staff members. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) underwent a review led by Secretary Chertoff, resulting in a six-point agenda to increase preparedness, strengthen security, enhance information sharing, improve stewardship, and re-align the organization for better performance. Specific policy initiatives will be launched in key areas based on this agenda. Secretary Chertoff announced structural changes at DHS to improve mission performance, including the formation of a new policy office, improvements in intelligence sharing, an operations coordination office, and a consolidation effort. These changes aim to enhance preparedness and security. The Policy Directorate at DHS, proposed by Secretary Chertoff, aims to strengthen policy development and planning within the department. This initiative builds upon previous recommendations for an Under Secretary of Policy and consolidation of policy analysis offices. Senator Susan Collins highlighted the need for an Under Secretary for Policy, leading to the unveiling of the proposed Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs (OPPIA). The Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs (OPPIA) was established to oversee strategic policy development and program policy efforts in the Department, including economic, regulatory, legislative, and foreign policy analysis functions. It manages the Policy Review Board to evaluate and promote major policy initiatives, ensuring alignment with strategic goals and enhancing inter-departmental engagement. House approved $8.7 million for OPPIA, while Senate recommended $7.25 million. The Senate approved $7.25 million for OPPIA, but there was a discrepancy in expectations regarding its functions compared to the Operational Integration Staff. Secretary Chertoff notified Congress of reorganization plans within DHS, including the establishment of OPPIA under an Assistant Secretary's leadership. Secretary Chertoff requested legislation to elevate the Assistant Secretary to an Under Secretary within the Department, who would head the Directorate for Policy. Various organizational units will be relocated to a new centralized policy office, including the Office of International Affairs and the Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office. A strategic policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator will also be established. Additionally, the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer to ensure coordination and analysis of intelligence within the Department. The Department of Homeland Security was tasked with analyzing information to identify terrorist threats and vulnerabilities. However, this provision was undermined shortly after the Homeland Security Act was signed into law. President George W. Bush announced changes in his 2003 State of the Union Address. In his 2003 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush announced the creation of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) to merge and analyze all threat information. TTIC had the primary responsibility for terrorism analysis, while the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) focused on assessing threats and vulnerabilities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 transferred TTIC to the newly created National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), designated as the primary organization for analyzing and integrating all intelligence related to terrorism and counterterrorism. NCTC is responsible for strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities and coordinating with homeland security efforts. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations directed the DHS to review the mission and functions of IAIP in light of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Secretary Chertoff mentioned the presence of over 10 different intelligence offices within the Department, including CBP, TSA, USCG, and ICE. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to elevate the Information Analysis resources within the Department of Homeland Security, creating a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary. This new Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA) will coordinate activities and fuse information from all intelligence offices in DHS, with the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis serving as the Chief Intelligence Officer. The IA will provide intelligence support to the Department and disseminate information to State and local partners. The Secretary of Homeland Security announced plans to elevate the Information Analysis resources by creating a stand-alone Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA). The IA will coordinate and integrate intelligence from all DHS components, with the Chief Intelligence Officer being able to speak for all intelligence components within DHS and bring their own intelligence collection capability to the table. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer will be one of two officials at DHS involved in the intelligence community, with a presence anticipated at the NCTC. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to establish a new Director of Operations Coordination within DHS to improve coordination among operational components. This includes TSA, CBP, USSS, USCIS, ICE, FEMA, and USCG having a direct line to the Secretary. The goal is to translate intelligence and policy into joint, well-coordinated actions. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to establish an Office of Operations Coordination (OOC) within DHS, headed by the Director of Operations Coordination, to improve coordination among operational components. This restructuring aims to streamline the coordination process and eliminate inefficiencies. Additionally, he highlighted the department's focus on preparedness for both terrorism and natural disasters. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to consolidate the Department's preparedness efforts into a single directorate led by an Under Secretary for Preparedness. FEMA will focus on response and recovery, while the new directorate will support FEMA with training resources. A Chief Medical Officer will be appointed to advise on medical preparedness and coordinate with other government agencies. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to create a new position of Assistant Secretary for Cyber and Telecommunications Security within the Preparedness Directorate to centralize coordination efforts. He also proposed separating preparedness resources from response and recovery within the IAIP Directorate, renaming it the Directorate for Preparedness. This reorganization aimed to streamline management of preparedness programs without requiring congressional action. The restructuring plan proposed by Secretary Chertoff involves transferring certain FEMA programs to the Preparedness Directorate to streamline preparedness efforts. This move aims to allow FEMA to focus on its core mission while the Preparedness Directorate utilizes FEMA's expertise for comprehensive preparedness from prevention to recovery. The restructuring plan proposed by Secretary Chertoff involves transferring FEMA programs to the Preparedness Directorate to streamline preparedness efforts. The new directorate will focus on prevention, protection, response, and recovery, ensuring all critical functions are unified and coordinated. Additionally, a Chief Medical Officer will be appointed to oversee medical preparedness efforts. The Secretary proposed appointing a Chief Medical Officer to oversee prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts in health emergencies, emphasizing the importance of response and recovery in biological threats. The Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications (OCST) will focus on analyzing and coordinating information on cyber threats and supporting telecommunications infrastructure. The Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications (OCST) will support telecommunications infrastructure for national security and emergency communications needs. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan includes shifting entities like the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and the Federal Air Marshal Service to new reporting structures. Enforcement to TSA effective October 1, 2005, Secretary Chertoff reorganized the department by merging offices to create the new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs (OLIA) and returning the Office of Security to its original reporting status. This was aimed at improving responses to Congressional reporting requirements and integrating security concerns more effectively with management functions across the Department. The Secretary of Homeland Security discussed the relocation of the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination (ONCRC) to the Preparedness Directorate, emphasizing the importance of linking preparedness for the Capital with general preparedness. The move aims to enhance the National Capital's participation in preparedness planning, including biopreparedness, by leveraging its unique perspective on the city's challenges as the seat of government. This relocation is seen as a way to strengthen the office's ability to influence various preparedness functions crucial for protecting the country's Capital. The Secretary of Homeland Security discussed plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS). He mentioned that FPS would be moved to ICE due to its law enforcement function, while FAMS would be moved back to TSA to allow ICE leadership to focus on FPS. Additionally, a proposed Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) would report directly to the Secretary, with both him and the Secretary of Energy committed to its success. The proposed merger of CBP and ICE was suggested but did not materialize in Secretary Chertoff's plans. The House Committee on Homeland Security included a provision in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requiring a review of the organizational structure of CBP and ICE. Secretary Chertoff's 2SR initiative had been ongoing for two months when he testified before Congress about the CBP-ICE merger proposal. He considered the merger but ultimately concluded that operational collaboration between the two entities, along with other components like the Coast Guard and infrastructure protection, was more important. He emphasized the need for a department-wide approach to border security strategy. Secretary Chertoff emphasized the need for a comprehensive border security strategy that includes operational collaboration between CBP, ICE, and the Coast Guard. He proposed a restructuring to unify operations and policy across the department, ensuring a coordinated approach to maritime areas. The DHS Inspector General recommended merging CBP and ICE into a single entity, contradicting Secretary Chertoff's realignment plan. The merger was not seen as a solution to the coordination and financial issues, with the current efforts believed to address the existing problems. The proposal contradicts Secretary Chertoff's 2SR realignment plan, which aims to keep CBP and ICE separate. Senator Collins raised concerns about the lack of legislative authority for the proposed changes and urged a more comprehensive reauthorization bill. Senator Collins questioned Secretary Chertoff's broad interpretation of his reorganization authority under Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act, as revealed in a footnote in his notification letter to Congress. Senator Lieberman also expressed agreement with her concerns, suggesting that they did not view the Secretary's authority as being as extensive as he claimed. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize organizational units within the Department with limitations, requiring notice to Congress and explanation of rationale. The term \"organizational units\" is not clearly defined, but it is suggested to be smaller than agencies or entities based on statutory construction analysis. In the Homeland Security Act, Congress allows the Secretary to reorganize organizational units within the Department, suggesting they are smaller than agencies or entities. The term \"organizational units\" affects the Secretary's authority to reorganize DHS, potentially limited to structures smaller than an agency, entity, or bureau. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize organizational units within the Department, which are smaller than agencies or entities. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization of DHS resulted in a \"flattening\" of the department, with changes to hierarchical directorates and lines of reporting. The reorganization raised concerns about oversight of the agencies under the new structure. The report commended Secretary Chertoff for his reorganization of DHS but expressed frustration with the lack of details in his proposals. Concerns were raised about the potential for political staff in the Secretary's office to have too much control over law enforcement and screening agencies. Additionally, there were concerns about potential competition between infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and first-responder needs. The failure to merge CBP and ICE was seen as a mistake, as well as the lack of strengthened investigative powers for the DHS Privacy Officer. The report criticized Secretary Chertoff for ignoring assessments supporting the elevation of certain offices in the Management Directorate within DHS, as well as for not implementing a long-term planning system like a Quadrennial Defense Review. Concerns were also raised about the composition of the department's leadership under Chertoff's reorganization proposal. The report criticized Secretary Chertoff for not specifying compensation and appointment authority for new leadership positions in DHS. Congress has the authority to establish departments, agencies, and leadership positions, determining accountability and appointment processes. The appointment of leadership positions in the United States can be done by the President with Senate advice and consent (PAS positions) or by the President alone (PA positions). Congress often creates departmental leadership positions as PAS positions, allowing Senators to have a role in nominee selection and oversight. Confirmation hearings provide an opportunity for Senators to conduct oversight and obtain a commitment from nominees to appear before Congress when summoned. This commitment makes the process easier for Congress, as officers with operational duties can be called before committees regardless of appointment status. In some cases, appointment authority is assigned to the President alone, particularly for positions in the White House Office. These officials often serve as advisers and are privy to confidential policy discussions. The Homeland Security Act created seven such positions in the new department, giving Congress less influence over appointments. Appointment authority is also sometimes assigned to the Secretary, especially for lower-level officers, granting the Secretary the most discretion. Such appointments are usually made with White House consent, but congressional oversight is limited. The Homeland Security Act created up to 12 Assistant Secretary positions, appointed by the President with Senate consent. The President nominated individuals for various Assistant Secretary positions within the department. Under Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal, the Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement was to become a commissioner reporting directly to the Secretary. The reorganization proposal under Secretary Chertoff included changes to the Executive Schedule, with the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Security Administration becoming a director reporting directly to the Secretary. The Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office was to be integrated into the new OPPIA, initially led by an Assistant Secretary nominated by the President. The Assistant Secretary overseeing other Assistant Secretaries was to be elevated to Under Secretary level. The reorganization proposals by Secretary Chertoff included creating several new Assistant Secretary positions, such as Cyber Security, Grants and Training, International Affairs, Private Sector, and Strategic Plans. It was unclear if these positions would be part of the 12 statutory Assistant Secretaries mandated by the Homeland Security Act or created administratively. The President endorsed the creation of these positions, which were different from those appointed solely by the President. The Act created two new presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary positions, distinct from the previously discussed positions. These positions were responsible for assisting the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. Secretary Chertoff's proposal aimed to elevate the Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA) was renamed to provide intelligence support to the Department and disseminate information to State and local partners. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer. Additionally, new Assistant Secretary positions were created within DHS, filled by non-career Senior Executive Service (SES) appointees. The proposed reorganization aimed to change the office's location, hierarchy, responsibilities, and title. The reorganization proposal by Secretary Chertoff aimed to consolidate responsibilities from the Office of Legislative Affairs and the State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness Office into a new office headed by an Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs. Other leadership positions included Director of Operations Coordination, Director of FEMA, head of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and Chief Medical Officer. Appointment authority and compensation levels were not specified initially. The reorganization proposal by Secretary Chertoff aimed to consolidate responsibilities into new leadership positions, prompting questions about hierarchy and organization within the department. Conferees on the DHS appropriations bill mostly accepted budget amendments to support Chertoff's plan. The DHS appropriations bill largely accepted amendments endorsing Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan, including abolishing the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, dividing the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, transferring the Federal Air Marshal Service, expanding the Office of Policy, and reassigning the Office of Security and Office of State and Local functions. The DHS appropriations bill accepted amendments endorsing Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan, including creating the new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, establishing a Preparedness Directorate, and conducting a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. The House and Senate approved the bill, clearing it for the President's signature despite controversy over FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina. Secretary Chertoff implemented his 2SR plan on October 1, 2005, restructuring DHS under Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act. Questions arose about the extent of his authority to enact the reorganization. Despite some confusion, a DHS press release stated that the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Act adopted many aspects of the plan. The FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Act adopted changes proposed in the 2SR process, restructuring DHS under Secretary Chertoff's plan. The conferees agreed to abolish the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, merging its functions into other offices and agencies within the Department. The conferees agreed to split the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection into two new components\u2014Analysis and Operations and the Preparedness Directorate, transferring State and local grants to the new Preparedness Directorate. They also moved the Federal Air Marshals to the Transportation Security Administration and expanded the roles of the Office of Policy. Additionally, the conferees did not provide funding for the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security as proposed by Secretary Chertoff, who lacked the authority to abolish it. Secretary Chertoff announced changes to FEMA's operations post-Hurricane Katrina, focusing on contracting, communications, disaster-assistance, and staffing. Legislation was introduced to remove FEMA from DHS and restore its independence. Chertoff planned to restructure FEMA for efficient emergency response. The DHS inspector general's report on the merger of CPB and ICE into a single agency sparked a dispute within the department. Secretary Chertoff and senior officials resisted the merger recommendation, while Congress showed support. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, was tasked with integrating all intelligence capabilities across the department. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, aims to integrate intelligence capabilities across Homeland Security's agencies. He plans to establish a Homeland Security Intelligence Council to discuss department-wide intelligence issues and drive integration. Allen emphasizes the importance of DHS intelligence becoming fully involved in the Intelligence Community and National Intelligence Program. This effort is seen as a priority and a challenge for securing a place in the Intelligence Community. Jeffrey W. Runge, the DHS Chief Medical Officer, is developing a strategic plan to enhance the Department's medical readiness by utilizing cutting-edge science, technology, and intelligence in policy-making. He plans to appoint a Deputy Chief Medical Officer and three Associate Chief Medical Officers. Jeffrey A. Lowell, a former senior medical affairs advisor, highlighted the lack of medical and health assets within the Department of Homeland Security during a subcommittee hearing. The DHS Chief Medical Officer identified a lack of medical capability within the Department of Homeland Security and recommended establishing an Office of Medical Readiness. Collaboration with HHS and other partners is crucial for seamless integration of medical preparedness and response capabilities at all levels. The DHS Chief Medical Officer emphasized the need for clear leadership in biodefense, suggesting a role more aligned with a Chief Health Officer than a medical officer. He outlined four key areas where leadership is crucial: providing scientific and medical advice, enhancing situational awareness of biological threats, coordinating national preparedness efforts, and educating the public on preparedness. The 2SR initiative has seen leadership changes in outreach efforts for catastrophic health emergencies. Nominees were confirmed for new positions at DHS during the 109th Congress, including George W. Foresman as Under Secretary for Preparedness and Stewart A. Baker as Assistant Secretary for Policy. Legislation for a similar position at the under secretary level was proposed but not enacted. The position of Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was moved to a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary. The position of Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was moved to a stand-alone office reporting directly to the Secretary, now referred to as the Chief Intelligence Officer. Charles E. Allen was appointed to the position in 2005. Congress may need to clarify the responsibilities and authority of the Chief Intelligence Officer, as the hierarchical location has changed. Appointments to the position are made by the President alone, and there may be a need to reassess the appointment process in the future. The Assistant Secretary for Grants and Training was to be the same individual as the Executive Director of the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. Tracy A. Henke's nomination for the executive director position was pending as the Senate adjourned. Three of the newly created assistant secretary positions were non-career SES positions filled by individuals previously with DHS. Alfonso Martinez-Fonts, Jr. was appointed as Assistant Secretary for Private Sector, Cresencio S. Arcos as Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Robert Stephan as Assistant Secretary. Robert Stephan, appointed as Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, was to become Assistant Secretary for Strategic Plans in January 2006. The position of Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications remained vacant by the end of the first session, pending the FY2006 DHS appropriations process. The evolution of DHS has created three categories of assistant secretaries, with varied appointment methods. The appointment process for assistant secretaries in the Department of Homeland Security varies, leading to potential differences in authority and accountability. Senate-confirmed appointees are subject to greater scrutiny and are obligated to testify before Senate committees. Some positions remain vacant or are filled temporarily, like the Chief Medical Officer role filled by Jeffrey W. Runge in 2005. Secretary Chertoff appointed Jeffrey W. Runge as the Chief Medical Officer in the newly created Preparedness Directorate. Vayl Oxford was appointed as the Director of the Nuclear Detection Office. R. David Paulison continued as the Acting Director of FEMA. The status of the Director of Operations Coordination position was unclear. Congress may evaluate the leadership structure of DHS and consider codifying existing arrangements through H.R. 4009, the Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005. The proposal includes provisions for reorganizing DHS, conducting a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, establishing an Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and abolishing the IAIP Directorate. It also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a task force on protection. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with establishing an intra-agency task force on protecting security-relevant information from the private sector. This task force will determine the type of information that is security-relevant but unclassified, how it should be controlled, and its significance for national security. Additionally, the proposal includes reorganizing the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate, appointing an Assistant Secretary for Preparedness, and assigning specific responsibilities to the Under Secretary. The reorganization plan includes assigning the Under Secretary for Preparedness and Response primary responsibility for federal programs and relationships in the National Capital Region. It establishes a Military Liaison and abolishes several offices, including the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. The plan also creates a Director and Deputy Director of FEMA within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, along with a Chief Medical Officer. The reorganization plan includes merging CBP and ICE into a single unit within DHS, strengthening the investigative authority of the Privacy Officer, abolishing the Under Secretary for Management, and establishing joint authority for financial, information, and human capital officers. It also creates a Business Transformation Officer to develop a management integration strategy within DHS. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of an Office of Tribal Security within DHS, a National Cybersecurity Office in the Preparedness and Response Directorate, and measures to protect whistle blowers in homeland security. The Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005 establishes key positions within the Department of Homeland Security, including an Under Secretary for Policy and an Assistant Secretary for Physical Infrastructure Security. The legislation also includes a program for the secure handling of ammonium nitrate."
