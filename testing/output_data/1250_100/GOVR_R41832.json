    "content": "Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various policy concerns such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite some cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Pakistan's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened in recent years. The country's economic challenges, political instability, and security risks further complicate the situation. The troubled economic conditions, precarious political setting, and perilous security circumstances in Pakistan present serious challenges to U.S. decision makers. The spread of Islamist radicalism and the country's border region near Afghanistan becoming a haven for insurgents have resulted in significant civilian and security force casualties, as well as financial losses. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center reports a high number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with the country reminding the American audience of its sacrifices. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's refuge in Pakistan in May 2011 intensified U.S. scrutiny and strained the relationship further. In late 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen accused Pakistan of supporting Afghan insurgents attacking U.S. interests, leading to tensions. A NATO airstrike on Pakistani army outposts resulted in 24 soldiers dead, blamed on poor coordination. Pakistan reacted by scrapping bilateral agreements with the U.S. related to supply lines and covert activities. Islamabad demands a full apology from Washington for past actions, leading to the closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies. Negotiations to reopen the GLOCs have stalled over a proposed fee increase, overshadowing a NATO summit. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a lengthy prison sentence for treason, causing further tension between the two countries. The Senate Appropriations Committee responded by docking $1 million from U.S. aid funding for each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. Bilateral relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have remained strained, with anti-American sentiments prevalent among Pakistanis and poor views of Pakistan among Americans. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, and American civilians have been abducted there in the past decade. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan pose a significant concern for U.S. foreign policy. American citizens have been abducted in Pakistan, with fears of recruitment in Islamist terrorism. Key U.S. goals, such as defeating Al Qaeda and stabilizing Afghanistan, are hindered by the presence of wanted terrorists in Pakistan. Some officials suspect Pakistani government elements may be protecting these individuals. There is growing skepticism in Congress about the effectiveness of current U.S. policy and the wisdom of providing large-scale aid to Pakistan. Some in Congress are pushing to cut U.S. aid to Pakistan, which received $2 billion in FY2012. Pakistan's Ambassador warns that restrictions on aid could harm cooperation. The closure of Pakistani supply routes to Afghanistan has not had the expected impact, leading to concerns about diplomatic isolation. Working with the U.S. and NATO may be the only way for Pakistan to avoid further isolation. The civilian government's negotiating strategy could lead to loss of foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urged Pakistan to expand its role in securing peace in the region. Secretary of Defense Panetta acknowledged Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but emphasized the need to maintain a relationship. Continued engagement with Pakistan is seen as the only realistic option for the United States. The Administration's Pakistan policy includes increasing nonmilitary aid and conditioning military aid on progress in combating militancy and fostering democratic institutions. In 2011, up to $800 million in security assistance was suspended, and $1 billion in approved reimbursements remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Observers believe Pakistani behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives, leading to continued tolerance of safe havens for militant groups. Pakistan's foreign policy behavior is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading to calls for strong U.S. support for civilian authorities. Despite the need for a strong civilian government, Pakistan's leaders have not effectively addressed security policies or extremism, often blaming the United States instead. This perspective overlooks Pakistan's involvement in supporting Islamist militancy in the region. Official Pakistani support for Islamist militancy, including backing the Taliban in Afghanistan, continues to date. President Obama's decision to visit India without stopping in Pakistan raised concerns in Islamabad about a perceived pro-India stance in Washington. The US-India civil nuclear cooperation and alignment on regional terrorism have further strained relations, with Pakistan feeling encircled by India and the US. Pakistan is under threat of strategic encirclement by external forces, leading to a shift towards a more transactional relationship with the US. This change marks the end of the post-9/11 period of bilateral relations, with new restrictions on US foreign assistance anticipated. The focus is now on a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits to prevent noncooperation. Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's envoy to the United States, outlined prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing counterterrorism intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on \"trade not aid.\" Former U.S. diplomats suggest a more normal, constructive relationship with reduced expectations, targeted economic aid programs, enhanced business ties, and discreet U.S. support for regional initiatives. The U.S. should offer discreet support for initiatives promoting regional stability between Pakistan and India, and consider dropping opposition to the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. Analysts caution against a purely security-oriented approach towards Pakistan, emphasizing the need to avoid eliciting anti-American sentiment. Pakistan's intransigence on issues like GLOCs and the Salala incident may hinder cooperation with the U.S. in the region. Some analysts suggest a shift to a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan, advocating for targeted sanctions and cutting military aid. Others go as far as considering Pakistan an enemy of the United States in the context of Afghanistan policy. The idea is to use credible threats to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands to ensure genuine cooperation. Some analysts advocate for a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, suggesting targeted sanctions and cutting military aid if Pakistan fails to comply with U.S. demands for genuine cooperation. A Washington-based Pakistani analyst rejects this approach, arguing that it would strengthen conservative Islamist elements and fuel anti-American sentiments. Instead, they propose a more passive U.S. approach focused on providing security assurances and bolstering Pakistan's civilian governance institutions. It remains uncertain whether Pakistan's current economic rapprochement with India is a tactical move to ease pressure or a strategic shift in perspective. Pakistan's geostrategic status may suffer from international isolation despite potential tactical victories in Afghanistan. Analysts suggest a shift towards energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over conflict with India and \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan. The worldview of security services and public opinion hinder civilian leaders from pursuing such policies. The assassination of Governor Salman Taseer in 2011 highlighted the challenges faced by liberal politicians in Pakistan. The assassination of Governor Salman Taseer in 2011 and the killing of Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti highlighted the challenges faced by liberal forces in Pakistan due to vocal criticisms of blasphemy laws. Taseer's killer was lauded as a hero by some sections of society, while Bhatti, a Christian member of the federal cabinet, advocated for tolerance towards religious minorities and reform of the laws. The assassinations were condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Zardari, with Prime Minister Gilani being the only senior official to attend Bhatti's funeral. President Zardari addressed the assassinations of Taseer and Bhatti, highlighting the rise of Islamist radicalism in Pakistan. The controversy surrounding Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor involved in a shooting incident in Lahore, strained relations between the US and Pakistan. Davis claimed self-defense, but Pakistani authorities accused him of murder, leading to a diplomatic immunity dispute. President Obama referred to Davis as \"our diplomat,\" causing tensions between the two countries. In response to the Raymond Davis case, Congress hinted at reducing U.S. aid to Pakistan. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease tensions, expressing condolences for the loss of life. The CIA negotiated with the ISI for Davis's release, which was eventually secured through a payment of $2.3 million in blood money. Despite denials of any quid pro quo, Davis was freed in March 2011. Osama bin Laden was later found and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May 2011. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death near Pakistan's military academy raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism. Questions arose about Pakistan's role in sheltering bin Laden, leading to concerns about complicity or incompetence within the country's military and intelligence services. Pakistan's credibility suffered as a result of these revelations. Pakistan's military and intelligence services faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Army Chief Gen. Kayani warned against future incursions, while Parliament condemned the U.S. raid and threatened to close vital supply lines for NATO troops. Public demonstrations turned anti-American, leading to increased bilateral distrust and acrimony. Congress questioned the wisdom of continued engagement with Pakistan, expressing disbelief at their alleged ignorance of bin Laden's whereabouts. Calls for greater oversight and accountability for U.S. assistance to Pakistan were made. Senior Members in the U.S. expressed the need for more engagement with Pakistan despite concerns and distrust. President Obama and top officials maintained a positive stance towards Pakistan post-Abbottabad raid. There were divisions within the U.S. government over the future of the relationship, with some advocating for strong reprisals. On May 22, 2011, militants attacked Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station near Karachi. The attack on Pakistan's Mehran Naval Station near Karachi resulted in the deaths of ten security personnel and four militants. The militants destroyed two U.S.-supplied P-3C Orion aircraft in a 16-hour gun battle. The Pakistani Taliban claimed the attack as revenge for bin Laden's killing, raising concerns about the military's security and the safety of nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help led to arrests, with three navy officers facing court-martial for negligence. The Pakistani military is court-martialing officers for negligence in connection with the attack on Mehran Naval Station. ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who wrote about Al Qaeda cells in the Navy. The ISI denies involvement, but US officials claim senior ISI officials directed the attack to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. In January 2012, a Commission of Inquiry reported to the Pakistani government that it couldn't identify the culprits behind journalist Shahzad's murder. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in aid to Pakistan due to reduced military presence and visa delays. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan, seen as a warning for improved cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, suggesting reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. Observers believe the decision may lead to resentment rather than cooperation, validating Pakistani perceptions of the U.S. as an unreliable ally. Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz referenced a memo allegedly \"dictated\" by then-Pakistani Ambassador Husain Haqqani to J.C.S. Chief Adm. Mullen, seeking U.S. assistance after bin Laden's death. The \"Memogate\" scandal involved a memo allegedly seeking U.S. assistance to avert a military coup in Pakistan. Ambassador Haqqani denied involvement, and the investigation fizzled out due to lack of evidence. The civil-military clash raised concerns of President Zardari facing overthrow. Army and intelligence officers confirmed the memo's authenticity, but Amb. Haqqani was allowed to leave Pakistan. Prime Minister Gilani warned against conspiracies to overthrow the elected government, emphasizing the military's accountability to parliament. Despite rumors of a military coup, the army publicly pledged support for democracy. Tensions between the civilian government and the military escalated as the army and intelligence chiefs bypassed the government in engaging the court. The Pakistani public is against direct military rule, with opposition politicians not seeking military intervention. The presence of an assertive judiciary and a vigilant media makes a military coup unlikely in the near future. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border mistakenly attacked two small Pakistan army outposts, resulting in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers. Despite initial tensions, Prime Minister Gilani softened his criticisms of the military, and the crisis atmosphere faded. Pakistan reaffirmed its commitment to democracy, with Parliament passing a resolution asserting its supremacy and calling for all institutions to stay within their constitutional limits. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces mistakenly attacked two Pakistan army outposts, resulting in the death of 24 soldiers. Pakistanis accused NATO forces of intentional killings, leading to anger and closure of NATO's ground logistics routes. Prime Minister Gilani criticized the attacks as a breach of sovereignty and violation of international law. The Pentagon launched an investigation, but Pakistan demanded a formal apology from Washington. The U.S. forces acted in self-defense after being fired upon in the Salala incident, with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis. Miscommunication and poor coordination were cited as central factors, but no NATO personnel were found to have acted improperly. Pakistan's military criticized the affixing of partial responsibility on them as unjustified. The Pakistani perspective detailed firing first in legitimate circumstances, blaming the incident on the failure to share operation details with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for Salala. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the Salala incident on multiple occasions, with advocates believing it would mend relations with Pakistan. However, opponents argued against it, fearing it would show weakness. Secretary Clinton was reportedly set to apologize in February, but the plan was canceled after Korans were burned in Afghanistan. In April, coordinated insurgent attacks blamed on the Haqqani Network led to silence on the apology issue. U.S.-Pakistan relations were further strained in February 2012 during a hearing on Baluchistan, where calls for Pakistan's partition were made. Subcommittee Chairman Representative Dana Rohrabacher introduced H.Con.Res. 104 expressing support for Baluchistan's right to self-determination, causing backlash from the Islamabad government and Pakistani media. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, stating no policy to support Baluchistan's independence. The Salala incident led to a freeze in US-Pakistan relations, with Pakistan's Parliament conducting a review, completed in April 2012. The Pakistani civilian government showed assertiveness in foreign policy, with a review process seen as a civilian facade for military policy. The 14-point guidelines issued in April 2012 included demands such as stopping drone attacks, preventing infiltration, and seeking an apology for a NATO/ISAF attack. The government also emphasized no verbal agreements on national security and justice for the Salala incident. The Pakistani government demanded an end to covert operations and private security contractors in the country, as well as no establishment of foreign bases on its territory. The review also requested a civil nuclear deal similar to India's. Despite ongoing drone strikes, the Obama Administration expressed respect for Pakistani sovereignty. Talks between the US, Pakistan, and Afghanistan aimed to address the Parliament's 14 points, but hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship remain uncertain. The bilateral relationship between the US and Pakistan faced challenges as hopes for a reset were dashed when Grossman departed without any breakthrough. Pakistan's demands for an end to drone strikes, including \"signature strikes,\" and an unconditional apology for the deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala remain unresolved. The US government is withholding military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding until an agreement is reached. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on Afghanistan's future engagement, with President Zardari attending after a personal call from the NATO Secretary-General. However, President Obama's refusal to meet with Zardari and the absence of an apology for the Salala incident strained US-Pakistan relations. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for his involvement with the CIA in collecting DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence caused outrage in the United States, with the Obama Administration arguing there was no reason for Afridi to be held. The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee criticized Afridi's sentence as \"shocking and outrageous,\" stating he should be praised, not punished. Islamabad defends the legal process but even some Pakistani commentators question the conviction due to lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The Administration's assessment in March 2011 showed little progress in achieving key U.S. objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan, except for combating Al Qaeda. The U.S. government reported limited progress in combating Al Qaeda in Pakistan, with concerns about the lack of effective execution of counterinsurgency efforts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Despite this, Secretary Clinton certified Pakistan's sustained commitment to combating terrorist groups, allowing the release of security-related aid. In the wake of revelations about Osama bin Laden, Pakistan's certification for combating terrorist groups was met with skepticism, driven by political considerations. Despite limited progress, Secretary Clinton certified Pakistan's commitment to ceasing support to extremist groups and dismantling terrorist bases. No similar certification has been issued for FY2012. Indicators and metrics related to enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan remained static. Pakistan's COIN capabilities showed a decline due to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International efforts to stabilize Pakistan saw limited progress, with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement on hold. Taliban insurgency and al Qaeda affiliates still operate from sanctuaries in Pakistan, according to the Pentagon's report on security and stability in Afghanistan. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan remains volatile with persistent threats planned and controlled from Pakistan. Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations, acceptance of insurgent safe havens, and unwillingness to interdict materials undermine security in Afghanistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan. Incidents of diplomats facing official harassment in Pakistan, including the requirement of \"No Objection Certificates\" for Americans leaving Islamabad, have strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. Additionally, revelations of U.S. citizens of Pakistani origin working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy have added to tensions. Despite high-level interactions, President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a delegation to Islamabad to address these issues. Clinton emphasized to Pakistani leadership the need to eliminate militant safe havens in western Pakistan or face U.S. action. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed, but engagement continues at other levels. Secretary Clinton conveyed U.S. respect for Parliament's review of bilateral relations and eagerness to resume cooperation on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Amb. Grossman reiterated U.S. commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan during a meeting with President Zardari. President Obama reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to shared interests with Pakistan, including counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan, during a meeting with Prime Minister Gilani. Senior military commanders from both countries also held talks to discuss border coordination issues. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides expressed optimism about achieving a balanced approach that respects Pakistan's sovereignty while addressing U.S. national security concerns. In April, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to strengthen ties through civilian assistance. Amb. Grossman met with Foreign Secretary Jilani in Islamabad but made no breakthroughs on key issues. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met in Rawalpindi for the 35th time to discuss Afghan stability and border security. Missile strikes in Pakistan were reportedly carried out by American UAVs. Pakistan has been using armed American Predator and Reaper drones to target Islamist militants in remote regions, with President Obama personally approving the \"kill list.\" The drone strikes have been effective but controversial, with reports of civilian casualties and criticism for violating Pakistani sovereignty. The Pakistani government condemns the strikes as illegal and counterproductive, fueling anti-American sentiment among the public. Despite Pakistan's official rejection of drone strikes on its territory, there is evidence suggesting tacit approval and intelligence support. Some analysts view the strikes as necessary, effective against Al Qaeda, and part of a messaging strategy. There are internal debates within the U.S. government on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes in Pakistan, with some urging a reduction in pace. The White House review in mid-2011 reaffirmed support for CIA drone strikes in Pakistan but implemented changes for more judicious use. The program's top counterterrorism advisor claimed no collateral deaths due to precision capabilities. President Obama defended the program, stating it had minimal civilian casualties and was tightly controlled. Independent analysts dispute claims that drone strikes in Pakistan have not caused a large number of civilian casualties, estimating that 145-535 civilians, including children, have been killed. Despite targeting militants and their commanders, violence in western Pakistan has not decreased. The U.S. government may continue using drone strikes due to the upcoming NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Mutual mistrust between the U.S. and Pakistan's ISI dates back to the 1980s, with concerns about the ISI's support of Islamist militants and involvement in extralegal activities. The ISI, under direct army control, is implicated in abductions and manipulation of politics. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, appointed as DG-ISI in 2012, is seen as a potential candidate for the COAS position. U.S. officials accuse ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents with money and supplies, allowing them to sustain their insurgency. Afghan insurgent commanders claim ISI increased direct contacts with the Taliban, encouraging violence and supplying explosives. The ISI is accused of supporting Afghan insurgents with money and supplies, encouraging violence and supplying explosives. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. NATO report indicates ISI's manipulation of Taliban leadership. Pakistan denies allegations. The Pakistani military and intelligence services have long-standing relationships with terrorist groups, raising concerns about cooperation with militants. Despite official denials, independent observers believe that Islamist extremists have infiltrated Pakistan's security services. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables suggest bias in military training against the United States. Analysts suggest a division within Pakistan's security services between nationalist and Islamist factions. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident, with frustrations over lack of cooperation in military operations and suspicions of ISI support for certain groups. The Davis affair heightened Pakistani scrutiny of U.S. security officials in Pakistan, leading to demands for accountability of CIA operatives. OBL's death raised concerns about ISI links to extremism, prompting crackdowns on citizens working with the CIA. Pressure increased for access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody, with the CIA's Islamabad station chief's name leaked by a Pakistani newspaper. U.S. officials believed these disclosures were deliberate actions by the ISI. After the OBL raid, the ISI leadership faced increased scrutiny over collusion with Afghan insurgents. The CIA provided intelligence on bomb-making facilities in FATA, but they were found abandoned, leading to suspicions of tip-offs. Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work continued effectively. After the OBL raid, intelligence work continued with the arrest of a senior Al Qaeda operative in Karachi. Pakistan made efforts to mend relations with the U.S. by granting visas to CIA officers and capturing key Al Qaeda figures. Drone strikes in South and North Waziristan targeted top militants, with assistance likely from Pakistan. Bilateral intelligence cooperation persisted despite worsening government relations. The CIA has conducted a covert operation in Pakistan to establish a network of \"secret friends\" who are loyal to the United States. This effort aims to counterbalance the less reliable army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth in Central Asia through friendly relations with Afghanistan, which has led to support for various groups, including the Afghan Taliban regime. The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, known as the Durand Line, has been a point of contention due to Pashtun nationalism. Both countries are key allies in global efforts to combat Islamic militancy. The ongoing acrimony between Islamabad and Kabul is detrimental to U.S. interests as Pakistan seeks a post-NATO Afghanistan that aligns with its interests, while the U.S. aims for an independent Afghanistan. Pakistan's use of proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network in dealings with Kabul increases its leverage in the reconciliation process. Washington continues to rely on Islamabad despite these differences. The ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan stem from differing approaches to Afghan reconciliation. Washington seeks Islamabad's support in negotiations with Afghan insurgents, but Pakistan's strategy appears to prioritize ceasefire and waiting for American withdrawal. There are concerns that rewarding Pakistani intransigence could hinder peace efforts, as some believe the ISI has supported insurgent groups. Despite these challenges, U.S. officials stress the importance of Pakistani cooperation for long-term stability in Afghanistan. The Taliban's resurgence in mid-2000s was facilitated by safe havens in Pakistan, hindering pacification efforts in Afghanistan. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations, Afghan officials accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Analysts are skeptical of Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" to exert dominance in the region. Islamabad is concerned about the potential abandonment of the region by the international community. President Obama's announcement of a U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan in 2011 signaled a focus on an exit strategy, raising concerns about long-term stability in the region. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of Afghan stability, with Prime Minister Gilani seeking to strengthen ties with Kabul and move away from a strategic partnership with the United States. Gilani criticized America's involvement in the region and called for Kabul and Islamabad to take ownership of the peace process. The Afghan war required Kabul and Islamabad to take ownership of the peace process. The new Joint Commission met in June 2011, with Gilani and President Karzai expressing commitment to an Afghan-led process. Friction arose between Islamabad and Kabul due to increased reverse infiltration and cross-border incidents. Pakistan-Afghanistan relations deteriorated further in September 2011. In September 2011, Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani was assassinated in Kabul, leading to strained Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. Afghan officials accused the ISI of involvement, while Pakistan denied any role. Afghan intelligence claimed to have thwarted a plot to assassinate Karzai, with alleged culprits based in FATA and linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis. Islamabad supports peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, emphasizing Afghan government involvement and aiming to limit Indian influence. Pakistan's leaders aim to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan by controlling Taliban negotiations. They orchestrated the capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders. Pakistan launched efforts to broker reconciliation between Kabul and the Haqqani Network, sparking concerns of Islamabad exploiting the situation for maximal influence in Kabul. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures and the Haqqani Network with Afghan officials, raising questions about Pakistani involvement. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan suggested that Pakistan is hindering Taliban leaders from traveling to Kabul for reconciliation talks. Afghan President Karzai also criticized Pakistan for exerting control over insurgent leaders. By early 2012, Islamabad seemed to allow U.S.-Taliban negotiations to proceed. However, during a visit to Islamabad, Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations, which was met with skepticism by Foreign Minister Khar. Prime Minister Gilani issued an open appeal to Afghan Taliban for reconciliation and peace, welcomed by the Obama Administration. Concerns persist about Pakistan's ties with Afghan insurgent groups. The Haqqani Network in FATA is seen as a major threat to Afghan stability and U.S. security interests due to their close ties with al-Qaeda. The Haqqani Network in FATA maintains close ties with al-Qaeda and conducts high-visibility attacks in Afghanistan, causing tensions with U.S. and Afghan officials. Pakistan has not taken action against the Haqqanis due to their longstanding relationship and belief in their influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. The September 13, 2011, attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul strained U.S.-Pakistan relations, leading to calls for Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases. Admiral Mullen accused the ISI of supporting the Haqqanis in conducting a \"proxy war\" in Afghanistan, while Secretary Panetta issued an ultimatum to Pakistan to protect U.S. forces from future attacks. During September 22 testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral Mullen accused the Haqqani network of being supported by Pakistan's ISI in conducting attacks in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue. This marked a new level of U.S. intolerance towards Pakistan's regional \"double-game.\" President Obama later distanced himself from Mullen's accusations. President Obama acknowledged unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but urged Pakistan to address the issue. The Wardak truck bombing hardened Secretary Clinton's stance on the Haqqanis. Haqqani fighters were implicated in further attacks in Afghanistan, leading to tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan. Islamabad denied supporting the Haqqanis and warned of damaging the bilateral relationship. President Zardari criticized verbal assaults on Pakistan. Pakistani officials have sought to address allegations for nearly two years. Pakistani officials have been trying to facilitate negotiations between the Haqqanis and the Kabul government, but the close ties between the Haqqanis and Al Qaeda have been a major obstacle. Pakistan, with its influence over the Haqqanis, is seen as the only actor capable of pushing them towards talks. Some Pakistani military officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table to avoid a military conflict. However, bringing the insurgent group into negotiations would give Islamabad a central role in the process, which some in Washington and other capitals want to avoid. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law. The potential decision on designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not progressed in the House committee. Congressional frustration with the Administration's delay in the formal review on the FTO designation has increased in 2012. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer with commercial uses as a chemical explosives precursor. The use of ammonium nitrate (AN) as a chemical explosives precursor in Afghanistan has led to a significant increase in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used by Islamist insurgents. Despite a ban on AN in Afghanistan, most illicit AN is believed to come from neighboring Pakistan. The Pentagon reported a peak in IED attacks in 2011, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in effective IED attack rates. The U.S. government is pushing for a coordinated strategy to counter IED-related networks in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, urging Islamabad to restrict access to AN or enhance law enforcement and border security efforts. The U.S. government is actively working to prevent the movement of ammonium nitrate (AN) into Afghanistan from Pakistan through diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives. Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement operation, aims to combat the trafficking of AN precursors. Adding urea fertilizer granules to AN can complicate the process of making explosives, while other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency markers for easier detection at checkpoints. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the largest fertilizer complex in the country, producing over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict AN and other precursors, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The U.S. relies on Pakistani authorities to prevent AN trafficking, while NATO uses logistics routes through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan. The logistics routes used by NATO to supply forces in Afghanistan have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's anger over the Salala incident. Insurgents have targeted these supply lines, resulting in destroyed trucks and deaths of Pakistani drivers. To reduce reliance on Pakistan, the U.S. military has been testing alternative routes. The U.S. military has been testing alternative routes for supplying forces in Afghanistan, focusing on the \"Northern Distribution Network\" (NDN) from Central Asia and Russia. While Pakistan is preferred for its speed and cost, the NDN carries over half of NATO's supplies. The loss of Pakistani routes has not significantly impacted Afghan operations, with the British deputy commander stating they are managing well without them. However, the Pentagon views the continued closure of Pakistani routes as a strategic concern. The closure of Pakistani routes has been a strategic concern for Afghan security forces, with over 4,100 vehicles stranded in Pakistan. NATO needs to remove a significant amount of equipment worth $30 billion from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders pushed for the reopening of Pakistani routes before the 2012 fighting season. Pakistani officials indicated that reopening was imminent, with reports of a potential fee per truck. Pakistani negotiators proposed a drastic fee increase of $5,000 per truck, causing backlash from the Pentagon and Senate Armed Services Committee. Negotiations on the issue remain unresolved. Pakistan faces challenges from Islamist extremism, militancy, separatist insurgency in Baluchistan, and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center reports a decline in terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2009, but the country still ranks third in the world for both incidents and related deaths. Suicide bombings have increased significantly, with Pakistan accounting for nearly half of all worldwide deaths from such attacks. Military operations and drone strikes have led to a drop in Islamist attacks in 2011, but some observers believe the government is sometimes influenced by terrorists. Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have shown mutual animosity in the past. After 2009, various militant groups in Pakistan, including Al Qaeda, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Quetta Shura Taliban, Haqqani Network, and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), have become more intermingled and mutually supportive. The U.S. remains concerned about Al Qaeda operating in Pakistan, despite recent losses of key leaders. The LeT, with ties to the ISI, is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The Raymond Davis affair revealed new U.S. intelligence operations against LeT in Pakistan, a group considered the most dangerous in South Asia. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating terrorist ideology. Military dictators encouraged anti-Western sentiment to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. U.S. assessments show discouraging results in military offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan. While some successes have been seen in clearing operations, holding and building phases are challenging due to limited civilian administration capacity. Independent analyses suggest mixed results in military offensives from 2009 to 2011, with temporary dislodging of militants but no sustained progress in counterinsurgency. The Pakistani air force has conducted numerous combat sorties in the FATA, targeting militant groups. Despite some successes in degrading militant capabilities, ongoing fighting and insurgency persist in the region. Notable incidents include TTP militants overrunning a fort in South Waziristan and a deadly suicide bombing in Bajaur. The situation in North Waziristan, home to Al Qaeda and Taliban allies, remains a concern. The North Waziristan agency is a key haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to move their military into North Waziristan despite U.S. requests, citing the need to consolidate control in other areas. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks the necessary hardware for effective warfare. The expulsion of U.S. military trainers in 2011 has further hindered efforts to enhance Pakistan's capabilities. Military operations, political strategies, drone strikes, and internal power struggles have fragmented the Pakistani Taliban, leading to smaller, weaker factions. The Pakistani Taliban has fragmented into smaller factions, with leader Hakimullah Mehsud facing opposition from other militant commanders. Mehsud's close ties to Al Qaeda Arabs have caused internal strife, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. Talks between TTP militants and Pakistani officials have been suggested, but concerns remain after previous failed negotiations in the FATA region. Negotiations between TTP militants and the Pakistani government have been rumored, despite denials from TTP spokesman and Faqir's reported demotion for engaging in dialogue. Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar may be pressuring Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army. A \"Shura-i-Muraqba\" comprised of Haqqanis and other commanders aims to unify militant factions under Omar's leadership to focus hostility solely on Afghanistan. The Haqqanis seek to end the anti-Pakistan insurgency and redirect militants' focus to Afghanistan, which would benefit the Pakistani military. In April 2012, the U.S. offered a $10 million reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, leader of a terrorist group involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack. This move strained U.S.-Pakistan relations, with Prime Minister Gilani criticizing it as widening the trust deficit. Additionally, militants freed nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a plot against President Musharraf, in a raid on a prison in Bannu. The government inquiry blamed local authorities and intelligence agencies for the security lapse. The raid bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels and fueled concerns about the effectiveness of Pakistan's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the government for not acting against Hafiz Saeed. U.S. officials are worried about extremist groups in Pakistan, including the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, and other designated terrorist organizations. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for terrorism by Pakistan-based groups increased in 2010. In 2010, there was a rise in cases linking U.S. citizens with Islamist extremism in Pakistan. Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square and received a life sentence. Other cases involved Americans in terrorist plots, such as the 2008 Mumbai attack and David Coleman Headley's involvement with the LeT group. Headley's case was the first to directly link a former Pakistani military officer to terrorism suspects in the U.S. In 2010, Indian officials gained direct access to David Coleman Headley, a key witness in the Mumbai attack investigation. Headley's testimony implicated Pakistani officials, including LeT chief Hafez Saeed and an ISI officer known as \"Major Iqbal,\" in supporting Islamist militancy. Despite being acquitted of Mumbai attack charges, Tahawwur Rana was found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish target. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three wars and ongoing military preparedness, stems from the partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmir issue. Both countries have large defense establishments at the expense of economic and social development. Despite some successes in the Composite Dialogue, relations deteriorated in 2008 after the Mumbai terrorist attack. The large-scale November terrorist attack on Mumbai, India, killed 165 civilians, including 6 Americans, and stalled the peace process. Militarized territorial disputes over Kashmir, the Siachen Glacier, and the Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources emerged as another issue in 2010. Pakistani leaders believe regional peace is tied to resolving the Kashmir dispute. The U.S. government under the Obama Administration maintains a policy of staying distant from the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan and India are also engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference in Pakistan's western regions. India and Pakistan resumed peace talks in early 2011 after a hiatus of more than two years. The dialogue process included discussions on economic cooperation, establishment of a \"terror hotline,\" and expanding confidence-building measures related to nuclear and conventional weapons. The two countries also agreed to increase trade and travel across Kashmir. The July Joint Statement during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi was seen as a successful representation of the peace process between India and Pakistan. Trade ministers from both countries agreed to further liberalize bilateral trade, addressing issues such as high transaction costs and slow deliveries. India's shift in stance towards a proposed EU initiative to waive duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas was noted. The killing of Osama bin Laden had implications for relations between the two countries, with Indian Prime Minister Singh viewing it as a positive step against terrorism but also expressing concerns about potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan affecting India's interests. New Delhi saw the discovery of OBL in Pakistan as an opportunity to press demands for extradition of Mumbai attack perpetrators and other anti-India terrorists. Afghanistan's closer ties with India through a new strategic framework agreement heightened Pakistan's fears of encirclement. This development could make it harder to wean Pakistan away from using militant proxies in Afghanistan. Relations between Pakistan and India are currently better than before. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with the separatist rebellion in Indian-held Kashmir at its lowest point since 1989. Pakistan plans to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India by the end of 2012, which could significantly increase bilateral trade. Islamabad's shift towards freer trade with India suggests a willingness to move forward without Kashmir being a prerequisite. Additionally, there have been no terrorist attacks in India linked to Pakistan in over three years. In April 2012, President Zardari of Pakistan visited India for the first time since 2005, meeting with Prime Minister Singh. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers. Despite the tragedy, both countries remain entrenched in the conflict over Kashmir. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed agreements with Turkmenistan to build a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US as part of regional energy integration efforts. The New Silk Road Initiative aims for regional energy integration and bypassing Iran. Security concerns in Afghanistan may hinder investor confidence. India's relations with Pakistan are strained due to terrorism issues. Economic cooperation could prevent open conflict between the two countries. Pakistan and China have a long-standing close relationship, with China being a major arms supplier and involved in various economic projects in Pakistan. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit in 2010 strengthened ties, leading to significant cooperation agreements and business contracts worth billions of dollars. In 2011, Pakistan and China signed agreements worth $15 billion in various sectors, adding to the $20 billion government-to-government deals. China expressed concerns about Uighur separatists in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. As US-Pakistan ties deteriorated, Pakistan leaned more on its friendship with China, with Pakistani leaders showing increased closeness with Beijing. The Chinese government agreed to expedite delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets to Pakistan and is in negotiations for the purchase of six submarines. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a counterbalance to India but also recognizes the risk of Pakistan-based terrorist groups causing regional instability. This could lead to increased U.S.-China coordination to strengthen Pakistan's military and intelligence services and potentially pressure Islamabad to dismantle jihadist groups. China's support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions. The US and China could cooperate in nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. China's geostrategic reliance on Pakistan is likely to increase as the US deepens its partnership with India. However, China's interests suggest that its support for Pakistan may not be as unconditional as before. China is unlikely to get involved in any US-Pakistani rift and has no intention of replacing the US as Pakistan's main foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained due to differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups in Pakistan. The US opposes the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project due to sanctions, while Pakistan remains committed to completing it. Tehran has offered $500 million for construction after a Chinese consortium withdrew. Iran seeks barter deals with Pakistan to bypass sanctions. Pakistan's nuclear security is a top U.S. concern due to past illicit proliferation activities. Despite improvements, there are still worries about potential leakage of nuclear know-how. Pakistan is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is rapidly growing, with China planning to build new nuclear reactors in violation of guidelines. The Obama Administration is seeking justification for this deal. Economic challenges such as inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages, worsened by flooding in 2010 and 2011, are causing anxiety. Corruption hinders economic development and foreign investment, with foreign direct investment dropping significantly. Militancy is identified as a major factor in the decline. Pakistan's economic decline is attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. The country's economic priorities include addressing inflation, containing the budget deficit, and reviving growth. India's economic growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, leading to higher national wealth figures. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis prompted Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. The current IMF-supported program is a 34-month, $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement. Pakistan's economic decline is attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. The country sought multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF in 2008, leading to a 34-month, $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement. Currently, $3.6 billion of the IMF loan is yet to be disbursed due to Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms. Security concerns have further delayed negotiations, with Pakistan seeking U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions. Repayment of IMF loans will strain Islamabad's budget, exacerbated by low revenue generation and excessive military spending. Secretary Clinton has criticized Pakistan's 9% tax-to-GDP ratio. Pakistan's economic decline is attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. Secretary Clinton criticizes Pakistan's low 9% tax-to-GDP ratio. Efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies have faced challenges. Electricity shortages are causing economic deterioration, leading to businesses shutting down. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent. Inflation is a major concern for Pakistanis. Pakistan's economy grew by 2.4% in the fiscal year ending June 2011 despite devastating floods. Inflation is the most worrying issue, with 52% of people considering it the top problem. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges structural deficiencies in the economy, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to implement tax reforms and phase out subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. Poor governance is identified as the central cause of economic problems. International financial institutions regularly assess the Pakistani economy. The World Bank and IMF have issued negative assessments of the Pakistani economy, citing deteriorated fiscal situation, lack of governance improvements, and unsustainable policies. They recommend focusing on human development sectors, warning that poverty alleviation gains are at risk. IMF bluntly states that current policies will lead to low growth, high inflation, and weakened external position. Urgent policy action is advised. The IMF recommends urgent policy action in Pakistan to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and reduce inflation. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets, especially for textile exports. Democracy in Pakistan has been unstable, marked by power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. Pakistan has endured direct military rule for over half of its 65 years of existence. The bicameral Parliament holds federal power, with a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate. President Zardari was elected in September 2008. The military still influences foreign and national security policies, while the civilian government struggles to stay in power and enact reforms. The judiciary, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" battles the executive branch and pursues corruption charges against politicians. President Zardari faces corruption charges along with other politicians in Pakistan. The country's political turmoil threatens economic stability due to budget deficits. The ruling coalition faced challenges in 2010 and 2011, with the MQM withdrawing and rejoining multiple times over fuel prices and government mismanagement. The PPP strengthened its position in 2011 through an alliance with the PML-Q. PPP's alliance with PML-Q faction and support in Punjab province bolstered its status, posing a threat to PML-Nawaz. Senate elections in 2012 secured PPP's control until 2015, allowing them to block legislation even if they lose in National Assembly polls. OBL's death led to rare criticism of the Pakistani military, creating an opportunity for civilian leaders. The embarrassment of the May 2011 Mehran naval base attack and scandals involving abuse of power and human rights led to increased media criticism of Pakistan's security establishment. Despite this, civilian leaders did not take advantage of the opportunity to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Civil-military tensions escalated after the bin Laden raid, raising concerns about a potential military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for failing to request Swiss authorities to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The court found Gilani guilty of contempt but only sentenced him to the time it took for the court to adjourn. Despite opposition demands for resignation, legal scholars predict Gilani will be disqualified from holding office after the appeal period expires in June. The State Department considers the case a domestic political issue for Pakistan. Imran Khan and his PTI party gained support in Pakistan by attracting young and middle-class citizens with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies drew large crowds in Lahore and Karachi. The PTI has won over members from other major parties, posing a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N. While unlikely to win enough seats to become Prime Minister in 2013, Khan could play a key role in future governance. He has pledged to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption within 90 days. Imran Khan's rise in Pakistani politics reflects public demand for honest politicians. The emergence of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council, comprising Islamist parties, opposes cooperation with the US and rapprochement with India. Leader Hafiz Saeed of the banned LeT group is involved in DPC rallies. The Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) opposes reopening GLOCs, sees US and India involvement in Baluchistan insurgency. Anti-American rhetoric is used for political gain in Pakistan. Human rights abuses persist in Pakistan, with lack of government accountability and culture of impunity. In 2011, human rights abuses in Pakistan included extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances by security forces and extremist groups, poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence, privacy infringements, harassment of journalists, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, discrimination against minorities, widespread corruption, violence and discrimination against women, child abuse, commercial sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. Human rights abuses in Pakistan include widespread human trafficking, discrimination against minorities, violence by militant organizations, and lack of respect for worker rights. Pakistan is ranked as the world's most dangerous country for journalists. The Obama Administration has concerns about extrajudicial killings by Pakistani security forces. Blasphemy laws protect Islamic beliefs from insult. The blasphemy laws in Pakistan are popular but criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary. In late 2010, a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death, sparking calls for repeal. Despite efforts for reform, government backed away after pressure from hardline Islamist groups. High-profile politicians advocating for reform were assassinated, and no legislative proposals were pursued. In 2001, Congress renewed large U.S. assistance packages to Pakistan. In 2001, Congress renewed large U.S. assistance packages to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion over ten years. This included $8.3 billion in development and humanitarian aid, and $7 billion for security-related programs. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) of 2009 authorized increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and placed conditions on security-related aid. Additionally, the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was established to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. Congress has also appropriated billions for coalition support funds to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. Since 2001, \"support funds\" have made up over a third of U.S. financial transfers to Pakistan. Recent oversight improvements have led to more rejected claims. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report outlines objectives for nonmilitary aid, focusing on infrastructure projects like the Diamer Basha dam, a $12 billion initiative that could generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity. The Administration disbursed $855 million in civilian aid funds to Pakistan in FY2011, with concerns about corruption and oversight delaying the spending of KLB funds. Security-related U.S. assistance included \"train and equip\" programs, but arms transfers have been suspended since 2011. Pakistan has received helicopters, infantry arms, and other equipment from the U.S. The U.S. has provided defense equipment to Pakistan, but there have been delays in supplying equipment needed for counterinsurgency operations. Security assistance to Pakistan includes training for law enforcement and establishment of a Counterterrorism Special Investigation Group. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death have led to a reevaluation of aid programs, with reductions and new restrictions being implemented. There is growing recognition that U.S. military aid may not be effective in combating Islamist militancy in Pakistan. U.S. military aid to Pakistan has not effectively countered Islamist militancy and may hinder the country's development. Analysts suggest focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen civil society. Legislation in FY2013 includes provisions to limit aid to Pakistan until certain conditions are met. Legislation in FY2013 includes provisions to limit aid to Pakistan until certain conditions are met, such as supporting counterterrorism operations, dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and issuing visas in a timely manner for official U.S. visitors. Additionally, a bill to fund the State Department and foreign operations for FY2013 includes $50 million for the PCCF, contingent on Pakistan reopening the GLOCs. Legislation in FY2013 includes provisions to limit aid to Pakistan until certain conditions are met, such as supporting counterterrorism operations, dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and issuing visas in a timely manner for official U.S. visitors. Additionally, funds for Pakistan under various programs will be withheld unless the Secretary of State certifies Pakistan's cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and other specified criteria. The FY2013 legislation includes provisions to limit aid to Pakistan until certain conditions are met, such as supporting counterterrorism operations and preventing nuclear-related proliferation. The Secretary of State may waive these requirements for U.S. national security interests. Total State Department aid to Pakistan is limited to about $800 million, with specific allocations for different programs. Additionally, $33 million of FMF funds will be withheld unless Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The Secretary of State must submit a spend plan for assistance to Pakistan with measurable goals and benchmarks, and may suspend all assistance if Pakistan fails to make progress towards these goals. The bill provides that $100 million of the ESF funds may be used for Overseas Contingency Operations if designated by Congress. H.R. 5857 contains provisions withholding funds for Pakistan unless certain conditions are met, including cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and preventing nuclear-related proliferation. The bill includes provisions for assistance to Pakistan with conditions such as cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and preventing nuclear-related proliferation. It also requires a spend plan with goals and benchmarks for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance in Pakistan. Additionally, it allows funds for cross-border stabilization programs between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central Asian republics. The bill allows for the transfer of INCLE and FMF funds to PCCF until September 30, 2014, with notification to Congress by the Secretary of State. Funds must adhere to Sec. 7046(b) of the act."
