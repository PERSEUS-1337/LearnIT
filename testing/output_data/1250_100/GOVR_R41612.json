President Obama made alleviating global hunger a priority, leading to the launch of the Feed the Future initiative in 2010 with a $3.5 billion pledge over three years. The initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. Some argue for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance to improve global food security, with a focus on innovative approaches and local engagement. Interagency reviews of development policies and programs will inform Congress's discussions on funding and oversight of agricultural development programs. The 112th Congress plays a key role in funding and overseeing agricultural development programs administered by various U.S. agencies and international organizations. Legislation may be considered to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, including support for agricultural development assistance, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. The prospects for increased U.S. foreign assistance funding are uncertain due to the federal budget deficit and change in House leadership. The global food insecurity crisis has worsened due to food price and economic crises, with over 1 billion people undernourished in 2009. The number of chronically hungry people is estimated to be 925 million in 2010, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The 112th Congress may consider issues related to agricultural development and global food security. The number of hungry people in the world had been slowly increasing for the past decade, with gains in hunger reduction being reversed due to food and economic crises. The proportion of undernourished people dropped from 20% in the early 1990s to 16% in the mid-2000s, but rose again in 2008, hindering progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The U.N. Secretary General notes a slowdown in progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals in 2008, with a rise in hunger globally. The 2010 hunger report by FAO shows that 578 million people in Asia and the Pacific suffer from chronic undernourishment, with reductions in hunger mostly seen in Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa still has high rates of food insecurity, with 12 million fewer undernourished people in 2010 compared to 2009. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) shows improvements in various regions, with scores falling significantly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Near East and North Africa. Southeast Asia and Latin America also saw great progress. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest GHI scores, with different causes of hunger identified by the International Food Policy Research Institute. In South Asia, factors include low nutritional, educational, and social status of women, while in sub-Saharan Africa, issues like low government effectiveness, conflict, and high rates of HIV/AIDS contribute to high child mortality. High rates of HIV and AIDS contribute to high child mortality and food insecurity in countries with very high Global Health Index (GHI) scores, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Progress in reducing the GHI has been slower in these regions compared to Latin America. Only a few countries have managed to reduce their GHI scores significantly over the past few decades. Conflict and political instability have worsened hunger in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. In Swaziland, HIV/AIDS and inequality have undermined food security despite higher national incomes. The Gambia has seen an increase in undernourishment due to lower social protection. In the Gambia, undernourishment rose due to lower social protection spending. In Zimbabwe, economic collapse led to increased child mortality. Some countries, including Ghana, made significant progress in improving their Global Health Index scores. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger and pledged $3.5 billion for agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in Italy. The G8 Summit established the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years. They committed to five principles for a food security initiative, focusing on sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth. The initiative also includes social protection mechanisms and emergency assistance for those facing acute hunger. Leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance. The G8 Summit established the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security to mobilize $20 billion over three years. The initiative aims to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The L'Aquila declaration emphasizes supporting country-led coordination processes in line with the Accra Agenda for Action. Developing countries and donors have committed to country-led strategies, better coordination, and mutual accountability. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) under NEPAD focuses on targeting resources to country priorities. The Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) under NEPAD, established in 2003, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. The program aligns with the L'Aquila declaration and the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) to address immediate and long-term global food security challenges. The CFA proposes actions such as enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer production, adjusting trade policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. The CFA called for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity. Additional pledges were made by countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland to support the Global Partnership. The United States also collaborated with private sector actors on food security efforts. At a summit in Rome, 60 heads of state and 191 ministers endorsed the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported the need for a 70% increase in agricultural output to feed a growing population. The US State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative document, later launching the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative in 2010. The Feed the Future (FtF) strategy guide and implementation documents were developed through a consultative process with global stakeholders, focusing on sustainable food security principles. The initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries by enhancing agricultural productivity, expanding markets, and promoting policies for smallholder farmers. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative focuses on enabling smallholder farmers to manage risk and adapt to dynamic environments. Progress is measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers. The initiative aims to strengthen links between agriculture and nutrition outcomes, coordinating with governments and development partners. Progress in nutrition will be measured through changes in stunted and wasted children and underweight women. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative focuses on strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, global research and innovation, and programs in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. It does not include traditional U.S. food aid funding but emphasizes providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance. Countries were selected based on criteria including chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, and host government commitment. Investments will occur in two phases based on country investment plans. Phase 1 countries are preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) with key assistance including capacity-building and technical support. Phase 2 countries have completed CIPs with clear priorities, financial projections, and commitment to fostering agricultural development. FtF partners with selected countries to develop and implement CIPs for rapid agricultural development and improved nutrition. The FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for FtF activities, representing about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The request includes $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the GHCS account. Additionally, $408 million is requested for a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The FY2010 estimate at the World Bank does not include food and agriculture-related supplemental appropriations for Haiti. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Food for Peace represents only a portion of foreign assistance requested for food and agriculture activities. Additionally, the Administration is requesting $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011, including funding for food aid, migration assistance, disaster assistance, and refugee assistance. Discussions during the 111th Congress focused on the need to reform U.S. foreign aid capabilities to address national security challenges and development. The Obama Administration initiated the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to improve U.S. aid programs. Led by the State Department, the QDDR aimed to align aid policies with national security interests. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in 2010, outlining a strategy for \"Leading Through Civilian Power.\" This blueprint aimed to enhance American \"civilian power\" in addressing global challenges. The QDDR, initiated by the Obama Administration in 2009, aims to elevate American \"civilian power\" to advance national interests and support the U.S. military. It includes a statement of foreign policy objectives, recommended strategies, and reforms for implementation. Additionally, the Administration launched the PSD-7 in 2009 to review global development policy and roles of U.S. government agencies. Led by the President's National Security Advisor, the PSD review focuses on making U.S. development policy more effective. In early May 2010, a draft of the PSD-7 entitled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" was released, prioritizing economic growth and democratic governance. The Administration aims to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The PSD-7 process has been delayed, and it is unclear if final outputs will be made public. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development on September 22, 2010. The President's Policy Directive on Global Development emphasizes the importance of development, diplomacy, and defense working together for national security. It includes initiatives on Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health. The establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security at USAID will lead efforts to implement the Feed the Future initiative and coordinate with other agencies and partners. The 112th Congress may face various issues and policy options related to agricultural development and global food security. The President's Policy Directive on Global Development emphasizes the importance of development, diplomacy, and defense working together for national security, including initiatives on Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health. The 112th Congress may be faced with issues and policy options regarding agricultural development, global food security, food aid, and U.S. foreign aid reform. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative, with the House bill providing $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, 38% less than the Administration request. The Senate bill for the Operations funding appropriated $54.22 billion, $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. It included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs, $344 million less than requested. Congress did not pass any FY2011 appropriations bills, instead using continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and change in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities. The G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership is $22 billion over three years, with skepticism on meeting the pledge. Some skepticism exists in the international community regarding the G8 pledge to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund. The total amount pledged was US$914 million, but only US$263 million has been received. Critics point out that the G8 fell short of a previous commitment to provide $50 billion in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa by $15 billion. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, with key positions remaining unfilled, allowing other federal agencies to take on a larger role in development activities. The Center for Global Development criticizes the lack of USAID involvement in key foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Concerns have been raised about the decline in staff capacity at USAID, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighting the imbalance in national security capabilities. The national security capabilities of the country are still recovering from the consequences of the 1990s, with key instruments of U.S. power abroad being reduced. The State Department and USAID experienced significant staff cuts, leading to a loss of on-the-ground effectiveness and technical expertise. USAID has shifted from an implementation agency to one that contracts out a large portion of its foreign aid. USAID has transitioned from an implementation agency to one that contracts out a large portion of its foreign aid program. This shift has led to concerns about reduced coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. USAID has faced challenges in managing its agricultural development portfolio due to staff shortages, including expertise in agriculture. To address this, USAID has been actively working on rebuilding its in-house technical capacity by hiring additional agriculture foreign-service officers. Additionally, in the 1950s and 1960s, U.S. land-grant universities helped create counterpart institutions in developing countries, and in 1975, the Title XII amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act further solidified their participation. Since the 1990s, USAID's focus on capacity building has declined, leading to a significant decrease in post-graduate training support. This has weakened partner institutions in developing countries, despite USAID recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. Funding and support for agricultural research have also been reduced, impacting the duration and types of projects. Questions remain about the restoration of USAID's training and capacity-building programs, particularly in agriculture. Some concerns exist regarding the lack of institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, especially in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural research and education programs. Sub-Saharan Africa is noted to have a weak scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with reluctance from African governments and donors to invest in science and technology for agricultural productivity. Various U.S. agencies, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance, highlighting the need for interagency coordination in providing such assistance. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs highlighted challenges in interagency coordination for foreign assistance, particularly in food aid and nutrition. Recommendations included creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture and a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture. The Government Accountability Office also reported on coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and the Millennium Development Corporation. The Feed the Future initiative aims for a \"whole-of-government\" approach to address these challenges. The QDDR emphasizes the need for better interagency coordination in U.S. food security efforts, with USAID leading the Feed the Future initiative. However, details on coordination with other government entities and funding implications are unclear. Bills in Congress also highlight the importance of interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. Efforts to harmonize aid strategies and activities have been ongoing since the late 1990s to make international aid more effective and efficient. The United States aims to enhance international aid effectiveness by coordinating with other major donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union. This collaboration occurs in various international bodies such as the United Nations, the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, and with institutions like the World Bank. Global summits, like those in Rome, Paris, and Accra, play a crucial role in setting development goals and fostering donor coordination. Key principles include increasing aid predictability and flexibility to better address recipient countries' needs. Aligning with other donors also impacts U.S. bilateral assistance. The United States aligns with other major donors to enhance international aid effectiveness, impacting U.S. bilateral assistance. The Administration supports initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and the global food security initiative, endorsing principles from U.N.-sponsored forums. Some argue aid reform is slow, while others prioritize activities aligning with U.S. interests. Country-led planning is emphasized for program relevance and sustainability, though some in Congress express concerns over diminished donor control. Some stakeholders express concerns about country-led planning, fearing it may lead to government-led strategies that exclude civil society and private sector actors. Coordination between U.S. food aid programs and Feed the Future initiatives in focus countries is questioned, as Food for Peace Title II aid plays a significant role in U.S. food security assistance. Key questions remain on how to coordinate the provision of U.S. commodity food aid with Feed the Future efforts. The provision of U.S. commodity food aid needs to be coordinated with Feed the Future activities at the country level. Questions arise on how food aid can support FtF objectives and if there could be adverse effects from nonemergency or development food aid projects. The FtF strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change, but it's unclear how these will be integrated into country plans and strategies. Additionally, it's important to address the resources needed, metrics to track progress, and coordination with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and GCCI. The Administration is working on defining key indicators and metrics for progress towards FtF goals. The responsibility for monitoring and evaluating progress towards the initiative's goals is unclear, as well as the timeline for results and the impact on achieving MDG1 in the 20 countries involved. Congress is uncertain about the frequency of updates on the initiative's progress."
