    "content": "The \"Community-Based Independence for Seniors Act\" emphasizes the importance of community-based services in maintaining the health and independence of seniors. Without these services, seniors may face negative health outcomes and may need to rely on Medicaid for long-term care expenses. Targeting community-based services to at-risk seniors can help prevent asset depletion and Medicaid dependency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program to prevent institutionalization among low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Up to 5 eligible MA plans can enroll 1,000 beneficiaries each in the program and use rebates to provide supplemental benefits. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program will provide supplemental benefits to low-income Medicare beneficiaries through eligible MA plans, including long-term care services like homemaker services, home delivered meals, transportation services, respite care, adult day care services, and non-Medicare-covered equipment. Eligible MA plans must have experience in offering special needs plans for nursing home-eligible, non-institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries living in the community and working with low-income beneficiaries. The eligible low-income Medicare beneficiary must be a Medicare Advantage eligible individual, a subsidy eligible individual, not eligible for Medicaid benefits, and unable to perform two or more daily living activities. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program provides supplemental benefits to low-income Medicare beneficiaries through eligible MA plans. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan (CBI-SNP) allows eligible Medicare beneficiaries, including those aged 65 or older, to make special elections outside of the annual enrollment periods. They can switch from a non-participating Medicare Advantage plan to an eligible MA plan in the CBI-SNP program, or switch from original Medicare fee-for-service and a prescription drug plan to an eligible MA plan in the CBI-SNP program. The Secretary is responsible for educating eligible beneficiaries about the CBI-SNP program. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be implemented by January 1, 2018, for a 5-year period. The Secretary must ensure budget neutrality in the program, and may expand it nationwide based on evaluation results. The CBI-SNP demonstration program under Medicare will be evaluated independently to determine if it has improved patient care. The evaluation will use specific criteria and data collection requirements. The CBI-SNP demonstration program has improved patient care, reduced hospitalizations, Medicaid nursing facility admissions, and spend down for Medicaid eligibility. A report with evaluation results and recommendations will be submitted to Congress by January 1, 2022. Funding is allocated for program implementation. The Secretary will transfer $3,000,000 from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account for evaluation and report purposes. Additionally, $500,000 will be transferred for the same purpose. The transferred amounts will remain available until expended. The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to the testing and evaluation of the CBI-SNP demonstration program."
