    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of disabled children in private schools, leading to differences in interpretation among states and courts. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 under P.L. 105-17 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard and mandated that children with disabilities in private schools receive special education and related services funded proportionately by federal funds. This change aimed to address disparities in services provided to disabled children in public and private schools. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes to ensure fair and equitable provision of services to children with disabilities in private schools, including parochial schools. The amendments clarified the responsibilities of local educational agencies in providing services to these children. Children with disabilities may be placed in private schools by the LEA or parents, with costs covered by the LEA in some cases. IDEA requires services for children in private schools, even if unilaterally placed by parents. The 2004 reauthorization made changes for children placed in private schools by parents, while provisions for those placed by public agencies remained unchanged. Private school children are entitled to special education services based on district requirements. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes for children placed in private schools by parents, with specific requirements outlined. One key change was the requirement that children be located in the school district served by the LEA. This provision aimed to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools in multiple jurisdictions. However, it has sparked controversy due to issues such as disproportional effects on LEAs with many private schools, lack of funding formula changes, and potential conflicts with state laws. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced changes for parentally placed private school children, ensuring they receive a proportionate amount of federal funds for services. The emphasis is on providing direct services like instructional activities, with consultation with private school representatives for accurate child find processes. The law also allows services to be provided on private school premises, including religious schools. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes for parentally placed private school children, ensuring they receive federal funds for services. The law emphasizes providing direct services, including on religious school premises. New provisions include maintaining records, child find requirements, and equitable participation. Child find activities for parentally placed private school children with disabilities must be completed in a timely manner, with consultation between LEAs, private school officials, and parents. The cost of child find activities cannot count towards the LEA's spending obligation. The process includes determining federal funds for services and ensuring equitable participation. The new law requires timely consultation between LEAs, private school officials, and parents for providing special education services to private school children with disabilities. Private school representatives must sign a written affirmation of the consultation, and compliance procedures are outlined in P.L. 108-446. The new law mandates timely consultation between LEAs, private school officials, and parents for special education services. Private school officials can submit complaints to the SEA if consultation is not meaningful. Complaints can be escalated to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with the SEA's determination. Equitable services must be secular, neutral, and nonideological, provided by public agency employees or through contracts. Funds for private school pupils must be controlled by a public agency. The new law requires timely consultation between LEAs, private school officials, and parents for special education services. Private school complaints can be escalated to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with the SEA's determination. Reimbursement for private school placement may not be reduced or denied under certain circumstances, such as if the school prevented the parent from providing notice or compliance would likely result in physical harm to the child. In a recent Supreme Court decision, it was ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
