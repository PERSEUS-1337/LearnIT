    "content": "Persons with disabilities may struggle to find suitable housing and supportive services due to accessibility issues, discrimination, zoning laws, affordability concerns, and lower employment rates. Limited income can make in-home care and services unaffordable, and state funding through Medicaid varies. These challenges make it difficult for individuals with disabilities to secure housing. Persons with disabilities face challenges in finding suitable housing, often living in restricted settings like nursing homes or group homes. The need for appropriate housing gained national recognition after the 1999 Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which required states to provide community-based treatment for individuals with disabilities. President Bush announced the \"New Freedom Initiative\" in 2001 to address this issue through federal agencies. President Bush announced the \"New Freedom Initiative\" in 2001 to ensure full participation in society of persons with disabilities. The executive order implemented the Olmstead decision to provide community-based treatment for all individuals with disabilities. Accessible and affordable housing is crucial for achieving this goal, with federal funding available through programs like the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities. Other HUD programs have also been used to fund housing units for persons with disabilities. Federal funds are used to develop housing for persons with disabilities through programs like Section 202 Supportive Housing, Public Housing, Section 8 rental assistance, and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. The report discusses recent funding for the Section 811 program and issues such as mixed financing arrangements and homelessness among persons with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act ensures accessible rental housing for persons with disabilities, defining \"handicap\" and imposing duties on housing providers to prevent discrimination. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on disability, requiring new construction to be accessible to persons with disabilities. This includes features like wide doors, accessible common areas, and modifications for older units. Landlords must allow reasonable modifications for tenants with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on disability and requires new construction to be accessible. Landlords must allow reasonable modifications for tenants with disabilities, such as widening doorways or installing ramps. HUD and DOJ provide guidance on reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on disability and requires new construction to be accessible. Landlords must allow reasonable modifications for tenants with disabilities, such as widening doorways or installing ramps. Landlords are not required to pay for modifications, and may require tenants to restore the unit when moving out. Funding for home modifications may be available at the state or local level, such as through Medicaid waiver programs or grant/loan programs. Federal funds like the HOME Investment Partnerships block grant and Community Development Block Grant can also be used for this purpose. Landlords must provide reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities to ensure they can use and enjoy their dwelling. These accommodations may involve altering rules, policies, or services, but cannot pose an undue financial burden. Tenants cannot be charged extra fees for requested accommodations. This report discusses HUD housing programs that designate units for persons with disabilities, including Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, Public Housing, and Section 8 programs. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program also reserved units for persons with disabilities. Each program has its definition of \"person with disabilities,\" with some differences. The Section 811 program definition is used as a baseline for comparison with the definitions in the other programs. Residents must be 18 years or older to qualify for Section 811 housing. Under Section 811 housing, residents must be a person with a disability who is 18 years or older but younger than age 62. Families of persons with disabilities are included in the definition so that households composed of one or more persons, at least one of whom is an adult with a disability, may be served by the program. A person with disabilities is defined as an individual having a physical, mental, or emotional impairment that substantially impedes their ability to live independently and could be improved by more suitable housing conditions. Persons with developmental disabilities also qualify for Section 811 housing. The Section 811 housing program defines a person with disabilities as someone with a chronic mental illness that limits independent living and can be improved by suitable housing. Individuals with HIV, alcoholism, or drug addiction may also be considered disabled if they meet the criteria. Developmental disabilities are defined as severe, chronic impairments that manifest before age 22 and result in substantial limitations in major life activities. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as having chronic mental illness or developmental disabilities that limit independent living. The definition includes impairments in major life activities and the need for coordinated care for a lifetime. The Section 8 program has a broader definition, including those considered disabled under the Social Security Act. The Section 811 program defines a person with disabilities as having chronic mental illness or developmental disabilities that limit independent living. The Section 8 program has a broader definition, including those considered disabled under the Social Security Act. The regulations governing the program do not include the Social Security definition of disability, which includes being unable to work due to a medically determinable impairment expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. The Section 8/Public Housing definition does not exclude persons with HIV positive diagnosis but excludes those based solely on drug or alcohol dependence. The Section 202 program defines eligibility for housing based on disabilities, including HIV/AIDS. Housing options depend on the nature of the disability, such as physical, developmental, or mental illnesses. Individuals with drug or alcohol dependence as their sole impairment are ineligible for Section 202 housing. The Section 811 program funds permanent supportive housing for very low-income persons with disabilities. It provides capital grants for building construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition for housing. The program also funded tenant-based vouchers until 2011, but has since shifted to a \"rental assistance only\" model. The Section 811 program was created in 1990 as part of the Cranston-Gonzalez Affordable Housing Act to provide supportive housing for persons with disabilities. It evolved from the Section 202 program for the elderly and now operates with a focus on rental assistance only. The Section 202 program, established in 1959, initially provided low-interest loans for multifamily housing for elderly individuals. In 1964, the program was expanded to include non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals and families with physical impairments. Mental, intellectual, or developmental disabilities were not initially included in the definition. The Section 202 program expanded in 1964 to include non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals, but very few participated. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 broadened the definition of handicap to include developmental disabilities. Congress acknowledged confusion over eligibility for mentally ill persons in 1978. In 1978, Congress addressed confusion over the eligibility of mentally ill persons for Section 202 housing, stating it was never their intent to exclude them. HUD developed criteria for housing this population, funding housing for chronically mentally ill individuals in FY1982. The Housing and Community Development Amendments in 1978 required funds for non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals to meet special needs not addressed in Section 202 projects. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 addressed the low number of accessible units for persons with disabilities in Section 202 projects by introducing a set-aside requirement. Non-profit sponsors were expected to develop innovative housing solutions, such as group homes and independent living complexes, integrated into the community with tailored supportive services. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 increased developments for persons with disabilities in Section 202 projects. By the end of the 1980s, approximately 10% of funded units were for persons with disabilities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 required 15% of Section 202 loans for persons with disabilities, later increased to 25% by Congress. This law also included rental subsidies for these units. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 subsidized Section 202 units for elderly and disabled residents through the Section 8 rental assistance program. However, it was recognized that Section 8 was not enough to support housing for persons with disabilities due to higher costs in smaller developments. P.L. 100-242 specified a separate subsidy program based on the total costs of developing and operating projects for persons with disabilities. The FY1989 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 100-404) provided separate rental assistance funds for housing for persons with disabilities, which continued until the creation of the Section 811 program. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625) permanently separated housing for persons with disabilities from housing for the elderly. It created the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, changing the financing method to capital grants instead of loans for both Section 202 and Section 811 developments. Owners are not required to repay the grants as long as units remain affordable for at least 40 years. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 separated housing for persons with disabilities from housing for the elderly. It introduced the Section 811 program with capital grants that do not need to be repaid for 40 years. The law also established project rental assistance contracts (PRAC) and new development cost limitations for Section 202 and Section 811 facilities. The Section 811 program under the Cranston-Gonzalez Act addressed the special needs of tenants with disabilities, emphasizing community integration and changing terminology to \"persons with disabilities.\" It expanded housing options beyond group homes to include scattered units in multifamily housing developments, condominiums, and cooperative housing. Funding for the program included $271 million for capital grants and $246 million for project rental assistance in FY1992. The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act (P.L. 111-374) made significant changes to the Section 811 program, focusing on financing and community integration of units. It reauthorized the program at $300 million per year from FY2011 through FY2015. The law also allowed Section 811 rental assistance to be used for multifamily housing units developed with non-Section 811 funding sources. HUD referred to this funding as the \"Project Rental Assistance Demonstration.\" The Melville Act limited the number of units in multifamily housing developed with Section 811 funds that can be occupied by persons with disabilities to 25% of the total units in the building. This encourages developers to use other funding sources like LIHTCs and HOME funds. The 25% limitation does not apply to group homes or independent living facilities. Grantees combining Section 811 capital grants with other funding sources will have the project processing delegated to state or local housing finance agencies for efficiency. These changes could lead to a shift away from developments solely for persons with disabilities towards integrating units within larger developments. The Melville Act changes aim to make Section 811 funding more efficient by allowing funds to go further if not needed for capital costs. Most program funding has been used for capital grants and project rental assistance to nonprofit housing sponsors. HUD distributes capital grants through a two-step process based on the number of non-institutionalized persons with disabilities. Grantees do not need to repay the capital grants as long as the property remains. The Section 811 program provides capital grants to project sponsors to create affordable housing for very low-income tenants with disabilities. Grantees do not need to repay the grants as long as the property remains affordable for at least 40 years. HUD also provides rental assistance to cover operating costs, and sponsors must ensure residents receive supportive services. Approximately 27,000 Section 811 units receive rental assistance. The program's physical design can take on various forms, including multifamily rental housing. The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act (P.L. 111-374) limited rental units for persons with disabilities to 25% of total units in a building. Group homes under Section 811 can have up to 8 residents, with a maximum of 6 individuals with disabilities. Independent living facilities must have separate bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms for every four residents. Independent living facilities have individual dwelling units with separate bedrooms, kitchens, and baths for each resident, with a maximum occupancy of 24 persons with disabilities per development. The Section 811 NOFA restricts the maximum number of persons in an independent living facility to 14 in certain circumstances. Condominium units are similar to independent living facilities, with separate bedrooms, baths, and kitchens for each resident. Standards for condominium units under the Section 811 program are outlined in the annual HUD NOFA. Project sponsors for Section 811 funds can choose to serve residents with physical disability, developmental disability, or chronic mental illness, or a combination of the three. They may also further restrict residency to a specific subcategory of disability with HUD approval. However, they cannot deny occupancy to a qualified applicant who meets the broader disability category, even if they have a more specific restriction in place. Applicants for Section 811 funds must justify residency restrictions and inability to serve in integrated settings. Nonprofit organizations with capital grants for Section 811 housing receive project rental assistance from HUD. Residents must be \"very low income\" and pay rent based on income. HUD pays rental assistance to cover the operating costs of the housing facility. Supportive housing developed through Section 811 capital grants must offer services to help residents live independently. This model assists various populations, including elderly residents, families in transition, formerly homeless individuals, and those with HIV/AIDS. Owners must ensure availability of tailored supportive services for residents' health and individual needs, but Section 811 funds cannot be used for these services. Services may include assistance with daily living activities and mental health counseling. The Section 811 capital grants require organizations to submit a supportive services plan certified by the appropriate agency. The plan must detail service needs, list service providers, describe provider experience, outline state and local agency involvement, and show commitment to providing services for residents. Project sponsors must ensure supportive services are available but cannot mandate resident acceptance. Rental assistance funds can now be used for Section 811 programs. The Section 811 program under the 111th Congress allows rental assistance funds to support multifamily housing units developed with various funding sources. Properties can be new or existing, but rental funding cannot be used for units already designated for persons with disabilities or receiving Section 8 assistance. No more than 25% of units in a development can receive rental assistance, and recipients must operate the units as supportive housing for at least 30 years. HUD's Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program has allocated funds for this purpose, with awards made in two rounds totaling 8,114 units funded. HUD announced on March 3, 2015, that 4,584 units would be funded with $150 million for rental assistance contracts lasting at least 20 years. Funding is provided for the first five years, with subsequent years subject to appropriation. Eligible applicants are state agencies administering Low Income Housing Tax Credits or the HOME Investment Partnership program. Nonprofit organizations are not eligible for funding, but state agencies can partner with entities experienced in administering rental assistance contracts. Grantees must provide rental assistance to extremely low-income, non-elderly persons with disabilities. Section 811 capital grants are available to low-income residents, requiring a partnership with state health and human services and Medicaid agencies. Tenant-based rental assistance allows individuals to find housing on the private market with HUD vouchers. Landlords must meet HUD's housing quality standards to accept vouchers. The Section 8 rental assistance program, along with Section 811, provides tenant-based rental assistance to persons with disabilities. All vouchers originally funded through Section 811 are now funded through the tenant-based Section 8 rental assistance account. This collaboration includes using Section 8 vouchers with the Medicaid-funded \"Money Follows the Person\" program to help individuals with disabilities transition from institutions like nursing homes. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 integrated tenant-based rental assistance into the Section 811 program, allowing for the use of mainstream vouchers for eligible households. Initially funded through the Section 811 account for five-year terms, the vouchers are now absorbed into the Section 8 account. Congress first allocated funding for Section 811 mainstream vouchers in FY1997, with public housing authorities initially administering them before private nonprofit organizations became eligible in FY1999. Since FY1999, private nonprofit organizations could administer Section 811 vouchers, funded until FY2006. HUD allocated vouchers through an annual NOFA process, scoring applicants based on factors like serving disabled individuals in poverty. Since 2005, administrators must assist voucher holders in obtaining supportive services and provide technical assistance to landlords. In 2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers shifted to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers shifted to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. Funding to renew Section 811 vouchers has been provided through the Section 8 account since FY2012. HUD reported that vouchers originally funded through the Section 811 account totaled 13,905 by the end of FY2015. Additionally, Section 8 vouchers have been set aside for families with disabled members, funded in response to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. In developments, elderly residents and residents with disabilities lived together, with buildings designated as elderly only or prioritizing elderly tenants. Section 8 owners could create a preference for elderly families but not exclude disabled families entirely. PHAs could designate entire buildings as elderly only, affecting tenants with disabilities' ability to live there. Congress funded Section 8 vouchers from FY1997 to assist eligible tenants with disabilities in these developments. PHAs must help tenants find supportive services and assist landlords with accommodations. PHAs applied for designated housing vouchers to provide to eligible tenants. Congress funded Section 8 vouchers from FY1997 to FY2002, and again in FY2008 and FY2009, to assist eligible tenants with disabilities. Approximately 54,000 vouchers are available for residents with disabilities. An issue arises when vouchers targeted to persons with disabilities are not necessarily given to another person with a disability when vacated. Advocates have raised concerns that these vouchers may have been provided to non-disabled households. In annual appropriations acts from FY2005 to FY2011, Congress mandated Section 811 vouchers for disabled families upon turnover. HUD began tracking disability status for Section 811 vouchers in 2004. Unlike Section 811 mainstream vouchers, Section 8 housing vouchers for disabled persons must be made available to other disabled households \"to the extent practicable.\" The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act changed this in 2011. The law changed in 2011 to treat vouchers funded through Section 811 and Section 8 accounts the same, ensuring assistance for persons with disabilities continues upon turnover. The Money Follows the Person program allows states to use Medicaid funds to transition elderly and disabled individuals from institutions to community-based care. The Money Follows the Person program provides grants for individuals with disabilities to transition from institutional care to community-based living. Funds can be used for supplemental services like housing modifications, security deposits, and transitional planning activities. Some states use MFP funds as a bridge subsidy for rent until participants qualify for HUD-assisted housing. These services can be funded through MFP for the first 12 months of the demonstration. Finding permanent housing for individuals leaving institutions is a key challenge in transition programs like Money Follows the Person (MFP). Reports highlight the lack of affordable, accessible housing and rental vouchers as major barriers. HUD has encouraged Public Housing Authorities to collaborate with state Medicaid offices to provide housing options for MFP participants. In 2010, HUD made Section 8 vouchers available for individuals in MFP or similar programs. HUD released a NOFA for FY2009 vouchers for non-elderly individuals with disabilities transitioning to the community. Vouchers were awarded to housing authorities in 15 states, increasing the transition rate for persons with physical disabilities. HUD funds housing for persons with disabilities through various programs, including Section 811 and Section 202. Public Housing program provides housing for low-income families, with options for elderly residents and residents with disabilities. The program requires tenants to pay 30% of their income towards rent. Elderly-only public housing developments were authorized in 1956, with the definition of \"elderly family\" expanded in 1961 to include individuals with disabilities of any age. Residents with disabilities have increasingly lived in public housing designated for elderly residents since the 1980s and early 1990s due to factors such as the availability of outpatient mental health care and the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act. This led to an increase in younger residents with disabilities in Public Housing. Public Housing Authorities have seen a rise in younger residents with disabilities, including those with mental illnesses and addictions, leading to more incidents of disruptive behavior. To address tensions between elderly residents and those with disabilities, Congress passed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and the Public Housing Opportunity Extension Act of 1996, allowing PHAs to designate buildings for specific populations. PHAs must submit plans to HUD for approval to change building compositions, ensuring non-eligible residents are not evicted. HUD provides data on its website regarding these changes. Between 1974 and 1983, the Section 8 program provided rental assistance for new and rehabilitated housing for low-income families. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 allowed property owners to establish a preference for elderly tenants when selecting residents, but most Section 8 properties cannot exclude residents with disabilities entirely. Owners must reserve some units for households with disabilities if they choose to prioritize elderly residents. Beginning in the 1980s, the federal government took a less direct role in affordable housing development. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and HOME Investment Partnerships program were enacted to increase housing production and rehabilitation at the state and local level. Owners of affordable housing units are required to reserve some units for households with disabilities, prioritizing elderly residents but also accommodating near elderly families with disabilities if needed. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) was created in 1986 to incentivize affordable rental housing development through federal tax credits allocated by the IRS to states based on population. States then award credits to developers for financing affordable housing projects based on state priorities outlined in their Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP). The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program allows developers to receive tax credits for affordable housing projects based on state priorities outlined in their Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP). Developers must ensure a percentage of units are affordable to low-income households, with rent restrictions in place for at least 15 years. States prioritize projects serving the lowest income tenants for the longest period of time in their QAPs, considering criteria such as tenant populations with special needs. The QAP outlines criteria for states to consider, including tenant populations with special needs like persons with disabilities, homeless individuals, and elderly individuals. States can prioritize housing units for special needs populations in the competition for tax credits through various methods. The HOME program is a block grant distributed to states and local jurisdictions for developing affordable rental housing and housing for homeowners, with distribution factors based on eligibility. HOME funds are distributed to states and jurisdictions based on factors like population, poverty levels, housing conditions, and age of housing. These funds can be used for building or rehabilitating housing, rental assistance, and aid for homeowners and homebuyers. Assistance must target low-income households, and recipients have discretion in choosing populations to serve. Jurisdictions develop a plan for fund distribution through HUD's Consolidated Plan process, which includes assessing community needs and proposing solutions using federal funds and community resources. The HOME program allows states and communities to address housing needs, including for persons with disabilities, by using federal funds and community resources. States and communities must consult with citizens and organizations serving persons with disabilities when developing their plans. Recipient jurisdictions can prioritize housing for persons with disabilities in their Consolidated Plans and establish preferences for tenants with special needs. Additionally, HOME funds can be targeted towards individuals with specific disabilities for rental assistance and development of new housing. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, enacted in 1974, aims to fund housing, community, and economic development activities benefiting low- and moderate-income households. It distributes funds to entitlement communities and states based on factors like population, poverty, and housing conditions. CDBG funds are allocated through a formula targeting areas in need of community development. This program is subject to the same requirements as the HOME program. The CDBG program, like the HOME program, considers the needs of persons with disabilities. HUD guidance helps CDBG recipients identify and meet these needs. Funds can be used for housing rehabilitation and making public facilities accessible. Job training and employment counseling for persons with disabilities are valid uses of CDBG funds. The funding structure of the Section 811 program changed in FY2011 due to the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010. Changes included shifting voucher renewals to the Section 8 account and introducing the Project Rental Assistance program. In FY2012, no new funding was provided for Section 811 capital grants, focusing instead on renewing rental assistance contracts and the PRA program. The Section 811 program requires multiple funding sources for affordable housing projects, including Low Income Housing Tax Credits, HOME program funds, and other sources. Developers often need to combine federal funds with mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits, and local resources. Congress enacted a law in 2000 to help developers secure multiple financing sources for Section 811 projects. The 2000 law changed the definition of \"private nonprofit organization\" in the Section 811 statute to make it easier for developers to combine Section 811 funds with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. This allows nonprofit developers to loan Section 811 capital grants to for-profit limited partnerships, increasing the feasibility of affordable housing projects. The 2000 law allows Section 811 grantees to loan capital grants to for-profit limited partnerships, potentially increasing LIHTC value. Mixed financing arrangements are complex and not yet common. Section 811 PRAC treatment in tax credit transactions remains unclear, unlike other exempted federal grant programs. The American Housing Block Grant Program, Rent Supplement and Rental Assistance Payments programs, Shelter Plus Care, Single Room Occupancy programs, and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program are federal programs. The IRS has not issued a ruling to include Section 811 assistance in calculating qualified basis. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 removed limitations on mixed finance projects using federal grants like Section 811 with the LIHTC. Developers may qualify for tax credits worth 9% or 4% under LIHTC law. The definition of \"federally subsidized\" includes below-market federal loans. P.L. 110-289 removed the phrase \"below market federal loans\" from the LIHTC statute, making all federally subsidized new construction eligible for 9% tax credits. Section 811 developers may still find it challenging to obtain these competitive credits despite the need for affordable housing for persons with disabilities. HUD regularly reports on worst case housing needs for very low-income renter households. HUD's report on worst case housing needs for very low-income renter households in 2015 found that 7.72 million households were in severe need of housing assistance, a decrease from 2011 but an increase from previous years. Additionally, 2.8 million rental households had a non-elderly member with a disability in 2013. In 2013, 39% of very low-income renter households with a nonelderly person with a disability had worst-case housing needs. Homelessness in the US grew in the 1970s and 1980s due to various factors like the demolition of skid rows and decreased availability of affordable housing. President Bush aimed to end chronic homelessness in the early 2000s. Researchers identified chronically homeless individuals as those with disabilities who have been homeless for long periods. According to HUD's definition, a person is chronically homeless if they have a disability and have been continuously homeless for 12 months or have experienced four episodes of homelessness totaling 12 months in the past three years. Rates of mental health problems are estimated to exist in more than 60% of chronically homeless individuals, and more than 80% are estimated to have alcohol or drug problems. Medical problems, including HIV/AIDS, are also prevalent among chronically homeless individuals. Communities address chronic homelessness through \"housing first,\" providing permanent supportive housing before treating illnesses and addictions. HUD funds new housing for chronically homeless individuals, with 108,000 beds funded since 2001. The number of chronically homeless individuals has decreased by over 30% between 2007 and 2015."
