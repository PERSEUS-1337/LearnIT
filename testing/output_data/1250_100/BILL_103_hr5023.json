Additionally, the Act repeals the increase in basis of property acquired from a decedent. The \"Citizens' Tax Relief Act of 1994\" repeals Section 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the basis of property acquired from a decedent. It amends Section 1015 to treat property acquired from a decedent as acquired by gift for basis determination purposes. The subsection determines the basis for property under the death tax adjustment, with limitations on the net appreciation and Federal estate tax rate. The net appreciation is the fair market value minus the initial basis. The aggregate death tax adjustment applies to any estate. The aggregate death tax adjustment is calculated based on the net appreciation of properties and the Federal marginal estate tax rate, with a limitation that the amount cannot exceed the taxable estate. The Federal marginal estate tax rate is defined as the highest rate in the rate schedule, not less than 30 percent. The executor allocates adjustments among properties on the tax return.
