    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution. The cruise industry, a small fraction of the shipping industry, has drawn attention for its environmental impacts. The cruise industry is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, generating $40 billion in benefits in 2009 and creating over 357,000 U.S. jobs. The industry has faced concerns about its environmental impacts. The number of cruise passengers worldwide has been growing at an average annual rate of 7.4% since 1990, with 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The fleet consists of more than 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. The industry continues to add larger and more luxurious ships, with the average ship size increasing every five years. Safety and health for passengers are key concerns for the industry. The cruise industry generates significant economic benefits and jobs in the U.S. However, concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of cruise ships, which produce large amounts of sewage, wastewater, hazardous waste, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Proper treatment and disposal of these wastes are crucial to prevent risks to human health and the environment. Enforcement of existing laws for managing these wastes is seen as weak, with foreign-flag cruise ships involved in numerous illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters. Foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, with 83% of cases involving oil or oil-based products. 72% of the discharges were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. These cases represented 4% of all illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships in the six-year period studied by GAO. Despite the relatively small number of pollution cases involving cruise ships, some have led to criminal prosecutions and significant fines. The petition to the EPA called for action on pollution by cruise ships, leading to a study on cruise ship discharges and waste management. In 2008, the EPA released a report summarizing cruise ship waste streams, findings from data collection, and options to address ship discharges. The report highlights various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships, as well as the complex legal framework governing pollution from cruise ships. The report discusses the complex legal framework governing pollution from cruise ships, with some wastes covered by international standards and others subject to U.S. law. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to improve environmental operations, but environmental groups have called for stricter regulation. Legislation in Congress aimed to control wastewater and other discharges from cruise ships, but no action was taken. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment. Cruise ships generate various types of waste, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, which can emit air pollutants and threaten human health and aquatic life if not properly treated. While cruise ships represent a small portion of the international shipping industry, their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas can have a significant local impact. Specific types of waste, such as sewage and solid waste, are of greater concern for cruise ships due to the large volumes produced by the passengers and crew. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater, which can contain harmful bacteria, pathogens, viruses, and nutrients. Untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Graywater from sinks, showers, and cleaning activities can contain various pollutants. Large cruise ships can produce up to 30,000 gallons of sewage per day. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater, which can contain harmful bacteria, pathogens, viruses, and nutrients. Sampling by EPA and Alaska found that untreated graywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths, including fecal coliform bacteria levels higher than in domestic wastewater. Graywater is the largest liquid waste source on cruise ships, with potential environmental impacts due to nutrient concentrations. Solid waste on ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can become marine debris and threaten marine life and coastal communities. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling. However, up to 75% of solid waste is incinerated on board, with the ash often discharged at sea. This waste disposal method can harm marine life, including mammals, fish, turtles, and birds. Each cruise ship passenger generates around two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste daily, resulting in a significant amount of waste on large ships. Approximately 8 tons of solid waste are produced during a one-week cruise on a large ship, with cruise ships accounting for 24% of global vessel waste. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board, but off-loading can strain port reception facilities. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from various activities onboard, including photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and chemicals that can harm marine organisms if not managed properly. Oil leaks from engine spaces can mix with water in the bilge, posing a threat to the marine environment. Without careful management, these hazardous wastes can contaminate graywater, bilge water, or the solid waste stream. Oil, gasoline, and byproducts from petroleum breakdown in ship bilge water can harm marine life and human health. Chemicals like detergents and degreasers used in engine cleaning can be toxic to marine organisms if discharged. Large vessels generate oily bilge water, requiring extraction of accumulated oil before discharge to prevent environmental damage. Oil accumulated in bilge water needs to be extracted to prevent environmental damage. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water can harm marine life. Bilge water is a common source of oil pollution from cruise ships, leading to environmental violations. Ballast water is crucial for stabilizing ships during transport, but its discharge can contain harmful substances. Ballast water discharge from ships contains a variety of biological materials, including non-native species that can cause ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems. This poses public health and environmental risks, as well as significant economic costs to various industries. Studies estimate the annual economic cost from the introduction of pest mollusks to be around $2.2 billion. Cruise ships contribute to air pollution through diesel engines burning high sulfur content fuel. Further research is needed to understand the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen due to emissions from marine diesel engines, contributing to air pollution and health issues. Ocean-going vessels are significant sources of nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the US. International shipping contributes to global carbon dioxide emissions and emits black carbon and nitrogen oxides, impacting climate change. Maritime vessels face environmental pressures related to air quality when docked in ports. Cruise ship emissions, incineration of waste, and international regulations are key concerns in addressing these issues. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to its regulations. The six Annexes of the Convention address various sources of pollution, but require ratification and implementation by sovereign states for effective protection of the marine environment. The MARPOL Convention includes six Annexes addressing pollution control measures for noxious liquid substances, sewage, garbage, emissions, and ozone-depleting substances from marine vessels. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary, and ratification by member countries is required for standards to become binding. The United States has ratified several Annexes, with the most recent being Annex VI in May 2005. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of the MARPOL Convention, with no action taken regarding Annex IV. The country where a ship is registered is responsible for certifying compliance with pollution prevention standards. IMO has established various conventions, including regulations for ballast water management and passenger safety. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and comply with related laws. In the US, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships implements MARPOL provisions, with the most recent action in April 2006 ratifying Annex VI for air pollution regulation. In July 2008, Congress approved legislation (P.L. 110-280) to implement MARPOL Annex VI standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. The APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces regulations to implement MARPOL separately from other environmental laws, facing challenges due to the international nature of maritime shipping. Countries can verify compliance with international standards and detain non-compliant ships. The United States can enforce laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination between agencies is needed for enforcement, with the Coast Guard and EPA having regulatory responsibilities. The Department of Justice prosecutes violations, while the Department of State handles international matters. Other federal agencies also have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act (CWA), is the principal U.S. law concerned with limiting polluting activity in the nation's waters. The act's primary mechanism for controlling pollutant discharges is the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, which prohibits discharges from vessels without a permit. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated sewage discharge from vessels within 3 miles of shore. Cruise ships must have marine sanitation devices to prevent sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard regulates their design and operation. Raw sewage can be discharged beyond 3 miles from shore. The Coast Guard regulations cover three types of MSDs for large vessels, including cruise ships: Type II treats waste before discharge, Type III stores waste for later treatment, and Type I disinfects sewage before discharge. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulations, as they only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, and do not require monitoring or reporting of effluent discharges. The NPDES permit program regulates a wide range of pollutants from point sources, including chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, oil, and grease, unlike the limited coverage of bacterial contaminants and suspended solids in Coast Guard regulations for cruise ships. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of environmental requirements, with inspectors often lacking time and resources to properly inspect sewage treatment equipment on ships. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has shifted focus to homeland security, reducing resources for vessel inspections. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, but the US has not ratified it, leading to minimal requirements for cruise ships in US waters. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships in U.S. waters. Vessels must have a certified sewage treatment system or holding tank, with specific discharge requirements based on distance from shore. Cruise ships in U.S. waters must comply with Clean Water Act regulations, with some using Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for improved sewage treatment. Section 312 addresses sewage discharges from vessels by establishing no-discharge zones (NDZs) to prohibit the discharge of treated and untreated sewage into certain waters. States can apply to the EPA for NDZ designation based on environmental protection needs and the availability of pumpout facilities. As of 2009, 26 states have NDZs in place to protect their waters from sewage discharges. The EPA has established no-discharge zones (NDZs) to prohibit sewage discharge into certain waters, based on environmental importance and drinking water intake zones. Options to address sewage from cruise ships include revising discharge standards and imposing uniform requirements on all ships. Graywater is not defined under current federal law. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant or sewage. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. Alaska requires graywater treatment before discharge, and EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels with restrictions on graywater discharges. NOAA can restrict graywater discharges in National Marine Sanctuaries to protect sensitive ecosystems. NOAA regulations restrict discharges from cruise ships in marine sanctuaries. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges, including setting standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties. Cruise ship waste disposal is governed by the Marine Protection Act, requiring permits for dumping in ocean waters. EPA issues permits for sea disposal, excluding dredged materials. The Marine Protection Act regulates cruise ship waste disposal, requiring permits for ocean dumping. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships prohibits garbage discharge near shore and plastic anywhere. The Coast Guard enforces APPS regulations for all vessels in U.S. waters. EPA and IMO are addressing solid waste and plastic discharges from cruise ships. The IMO is evaluating the need to amend Annex V of MARPOL to address solid waste from cruise ships. Possible options include increasing on-board garbage handling technologies, initiating stronger waste management plans, prohibiting discharge of incinerator ash into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and enforcing no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and disposal facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste management for cruise ships, requiring permits and compliance with EPA regulations. Cruise ships must identify, store, and offload hazardous waste generated onboard in accordance with RCRA. Activities like cleaning, painting, and passenger services produce hazardous waste subject to RCRA requirements. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA regulations for managing hazardous waste generated from operations like maintenance and passenger services. It is unclear if they are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less stringent requirements. A release of hazardous substances could also trigger CERCLA regulations. Cruise ships may be subject to CERCLA regulations for reporting hazardous substance releases into waters of the United States. EPA requires immediate notification of releases above regulatory thresholds, with rules on reportable quantities as small as 1 pound for some substances. CERCLA authorizes the President to take remedial action relating to the release, in addition to regulations under RCRA and the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances into U.S. waters, including cruise ships, with regulations extending up to 200 miles offshore. Coast Guard regulations also restrict oil discharge within 12 miles from shore. The Clean Water Act and Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore, with specific requirements for vessels to maintain an Oil Record Book. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I for oil pollution control, applying to all U.S. and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. However, APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations due to most cruise lines being foreign registered. The EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships, including establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet standards, and imposing penalties for noncompliance. Clean Water Act regulations exempted ballast water from NPDES permit requirements, but concerns over invasive species led to calls for regulation of ballast water discharge. The EPA rejected a petition to regulate ballast water discharge as a pollutant under the Clean Water Act, citing long-standing policy and ongoing federal activities to control invasive species. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water from permitting, leading to a court ruling in their favor in 2005. In 2006, the court ordered EPA to set aside a regulation by September 30, 2008, regarding vessel discharges. The ruling applied to various types of discharges, including ballast water, graywater, and bilge water. EPA issued the Vessel General Permit in December 2008, covering large recreational and commercial vessels, including cruise ships. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) regulates ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels. It applies to discharges into U.S. waters within a 3-mile territorial limit, addressing 26 types of waste streams including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. The permit includes best management practices (BMPs) for controlling waste streams, with a focus on Coast Guard requirements for ballast water and BMPs for bilge water discharges. The VGP regulates ballast water discharges from commercial vessels and fishing vessels under 79 feet within U.S. waters. It includes BMPs for controlling various waste streams and imposes monitoring and reporting requirements. The permit does not cover sewage discharges regulated under CWA Section 312 or toxic waste discharges from passenger services on cruise ships. Cruise ships must adhere to detailed requirements for graywater and pool/spa water discharges, with operational limits in nutrient-impaired waters. Numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual chlorine in graywater discharges are based on USCG rules. The 110th Congress considered legislation on ballast water discharge issues. Legislation was proposed to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water under a program administered by the Coast Guard. Some groups opposed the legislation as it would preempt states from enacting stricter ballast water management programs. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality, setting health-based standards and emission standards for air pollution sources. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until EPA established emission standards for marine diesel engines in 2003. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels flagged in the United States, following a settlement with the environmental group Bluewater Network. The standards are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards and are part of several EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act. The rule aimed to regulate emissions from large ocean-going vessels, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. EPA continues to review technology for additional regulations on large marine vessel engines. EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels flagged in the United States in 2003, following a settlement with Bluewater Network. The rules aimed to regulate emissions from large ocean-going vessels. EPA is considering more stringent standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future, with potential inclusion of foreign-flagged vessels. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. The United States supported new global fuel sulfur standards starting in 2012 and stricter emission controls in Emission Control Areas (ECAs). EPA updated rules for Category 3 marine engines in 2009 to align with IMO requirements, setting emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The rules apply to newly built U.S.-flagged vessels. In 2010, the IMO approved the U.S. request to designate U.S. Caribbean waters as an ECA, subjecting ships to more stringent emission limits. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters, territorial seas, and contiguous zones with specific geographic boundaries. President Reagan's proclamation extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles, but it did not affect the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction. The Act also includes regulations for the contiguous zone established under international conventions. The 1999 proclamation by President Clinton extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile contiguous zone. This did not change the statutory definitions, so the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide, and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles. The Clean Water Act incorporates these definitions, with the ocean defined as beyond the contiguous zone, while the MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas. Limits of jurisdiction are important as they define areas where specific laws apply. For example, the Clean Water Act regulates sewage discharges from vessels into navigable waters, while the MPRSA addresses ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also applies to discharges of oil and noxious substances in navigable waters. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline, with jurisdictional considerations complicated by differences in measurement units. Cruise ship pollution in Alaska has raised concerns due to its impact on marine resources, especially after a significant increase in cruise ship visits in the 1990s. In July 1999, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines pleaded guilty to environmental violations in Alaska, including discharging oil and hazardous substances. They were fined $6.5 million as part of an $18 million federal plea agreement for violations in multiple locations. Concerns about the violations led to a program to identify cruise ship waste streams. Sampling in 2000 showed that most ships' waste treatment systems did not meet standards, with fecal coliform levels far exceeding regulations. The Alaska issues led to federal legislation in December 2000 establishing standards for cruise ships with 500+ passengers, prohibiting untreated sewage discharge in Alaska waters. EPA is authorized to regulate sewage and graywater discharges, with current limits of 200 fecal coliforms per 100 ml and 150 mg/l total suspended solids. Discharges are allowed within one mile from shore at speeds less than 6 knots under certain conditions. The legislation in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships with 500+ passengers, prohibiting untreated sewage discharge in Alaska waters. Vessels within one mile from shore and at speeds less than 6 knots must meet effluent standards of no more than 20 fecal coliforms per 100 ml, 30 mg/l of total suspended solids, and total residual chlorine concentrations not exceeding 10 mg/l. Coast Guard oversight and enforcement require sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. In Alaska, EPA sampled wastewater from cruise ships in 2004 and 2005 to assess treatment systems. Results show advanced systems effectively treat various pollutants. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001, following federal legislation in 2000, setting standards for cruise ship sewage discharge. EPA collaborated with Alaska on plume tracking surveys and studies to estimate dilution of discharges from docked cruise ships. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 setting standards and sampling requirements for blackwater and graywater discharge from ships. Effluent standards for large cruise ships were implemented in 2001 for blackwater and 2003 for graywater. Small ships were given three years to comply. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. Large ships have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards. As of 2006, most large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems to meet effluent standards. However, small ships have not upgraded their systems, leading to consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state water quality standards. This poses risks to aquatic life and human health, especially in areas where seafood is harvested. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative to impose taxes on cruise lines, increase fines for wastewater violations, and enforce new environmental regulations. The citizen initiative in Alaska imposes taxes on cruise lines, increases fines for wastewater violations, and mandates new environmental regulations for cruise ships. Revenues from the taxes will benefit local communities and public services. Some cruise ship lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative, and opponents argue it could harm the state's tourism competitiveness. Alaska enacted legislation in 2009 to give more time for implementing stringent wastewater treatment standards. Other states have also taken action to regulate cruise ship discharges. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation governing discharges of graywater or mixed blackwater/graywater into coastal waters, applying to large cruise ships with advanced wastewater treatment systems. California also passed bills in 2004, one prohibiting cruise ships from discharging treated wastewater in state waters. California has enacted several laws to regulate ship discharges in state waters, including bans on treated wastewater, graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes. In 2006, California also passed a law requiring ballast water performance standards by 2008 and invasive species removal by 2020. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the cruise industry for waste management practices. In 2001, an agreement between industry and Florida required cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard. Similarly, in April 2004, Washington, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a MOU allowing treated wastewater discharge into state waters, with no discharge of untreated wastewater or sludge. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue they can impose stricter requirements. The cruise ship industry has responded to pressure from environmental advocates by adopting waste management practices and procedures. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association have implemented guidelines for their operations, requiring treated wastewater discharge only while underway and at least 4 miles from shore. Enforcement of voluntary agreements is challenging, but having measures in place benefits water quality and provides data on vessels and waste treatment equipment. The cruise ship industry has implemented guidelines for waste management, including treating wastewater discharge at least 4 miles from shore. They have also developed Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and are working on technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. The industry has joined with environmental groups to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance to work on conservation efforts. In 2006, CLIA and CI collaborated to protect marine areas in cruise line navigational charts, focusing on Caribbean and Mediterranean regions. RCCL committed to retrofitting its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, following environmental violations in the 1990s. Following federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations, RCCL paid $27 million in criminal fines. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in three areas: laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight/enforcement. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are sufficient. Key question is whether existing laws and industry initiatives adequately address cruise ship pollution, or if legislative changes are necessary to fill gaps. EPA noted in 2000 that certain waste streams are regulated, but others like graywater are excluded or not adequately covered. Graywater contamination from cruise ships, including fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics, has raised concerns. State officials found higher fecal coliform levels in graywater than in sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear regulations for wastewater discharge, uniform standards, recordkeeping, sampling, and incentives for innovative treatment technologies. The Clean Cruise Ship Act, introduced in the 111th Congress, aimed to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting prescribed effluent limits. The legislation would require wastewater treatment on cruise ships, impose passenger fees for enforcement, and establish stricter effluent limits. Environmental advocates supported the bill, but no legislative action was taken. Advocates and industry groups have differing views on legislation targeting cruise ship discharges. Some states have passed regulations, prompting the need for potential federal legislation to harmonize approaches. Congress is also considering EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes, with no proposed rules yet. EPA's Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report examines various waste streams. The final report examines five cruise ship waste streams (sewage, graywater, oily bilge water, solid waste, and hazardous waste) and discusses current federal government actions to address them. Possible options and alternatives are identified, but EPA has not determined their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority. Other issues include harmonizing U.S. laws, defining \"cruise ship,\" and updating regulations for improved technology. Research is needed to understand waste generation by cruise ships, the impacts of discharges and emissions, and potential control technologies. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in identifying harm from vessel pollution and prioritizing resources. Research directions include studying pollutant transport in the marine environment, impacts of vessel practices, disposal options for sewage treatment sludge, cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems, and air emissions in areas struggling with air quality standards. In the 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report, EPA suggested research options to address cruise ship discharges, including nationwide sampling, testing, and monitoring programs. Existing laws and regulations may not be effectively enforced, requiring monitoring of discharges to evaluate current standards. Increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard is needed to ensure compliance with pollution prevention equipment and oil record book requirements. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution, including monitoring oil record books for compliance with MARPOL regulations. There are concerns about the adequacy of Coast Guard resources for inspections, especially after the 9/11 attacks. EPA suggests various options for enforcement, such as improving monitoring, involving passengers in detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. In its 2000 report, the GAO found issues with the process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries, recommending that the Coast Guard collaborate with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases and follow up on alleged pollution cases outside U.S. jurisdiction."
