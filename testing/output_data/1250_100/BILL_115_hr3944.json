Transfer of data to other agencies is prohibited, except for criminal investigations. The entity can transfer recorded data from body-mounted cameras to other law enforcement or intelligence agencies for criminal investigations or civil rights claims. Matching funds for programs are subject to Federal cost-sharing. The Federal share of program costs cannot exceed 75%, with Indian assistance available for matching funds. The Director can waive the matching requirement for fiscal hardship. $30,000,000 from the Bureau of Justice Assistance is allocated for this program in 2018 and 2019.
