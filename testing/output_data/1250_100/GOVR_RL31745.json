These pools also help states comply with HIPAA regulations regarding portability and guaranteed availability of coverage. States can choose to enforce federal HIPAA rules or establish alternative mechanisms like high risk pools. The 111th Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to establish a temporary high risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions. This program was required to be set up before 2014. High risk pools cater to individuals with preexisting conditions who have been uninsured for six months or more. These pools serve as a niche in the health insurance system, bridging the gap between private markets and public programs. While most Americans receive health coverage through employer-sponsored insurance, some individuals, such as part-time or unemployed workers, may not have access to this option. Public programs also offer health coverage, but eligibility criteria must be met. Individuals who cannot access employer-sponsored insurance or public programs may seek health insurance in the individual market. Applicants in this market undergo robust medical underwriting, where insurers consider personal health information to determine policy terms. In the group market, insurers calculate a premium based on the overall characteristics of the group, rather than individual health status. High risk pools were created to assist individuals with severe health conditions who are unable to obtain private health coverage due to rigorous underwriting in the individual market. These pools appeal to policymakers who prefer incremental coverage expansion and state oversight of health insurance. Supporters of HRPs argue that states can efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals using existing regulatory infrastructure and market knowledge. They believe that moving high-risk individuals to publicly subsidized pools will make individual market coverage more affordable, stabilize the market, promote competition, and retain insurance carriers. However, critics argue that HRPs are often too small and underfunded to meet the needs of those unable to access private insurance. State high risk pools can be unaffordable due to premiums and cost-sharing requirements, with most excluding coverage for preexisting conditions. Researchers doubt their ability to reduce the number of uninsured, especially for those with serious medical conditions. Consumer groups advocate for federal expansion of coverage, similar to reforms under PPACA. Congressional support for state pools began in the 1990s, with HIPAA specifying them as acceptable mechanisms for compliance. The Trade Act of 2002 authorized a federal grant program for state high risk pools. The 110th Congress reauthorized the grant program for state high risk pools through FY2010 and provided appropriations for FY2006. Currently, 35 states have high risk health insurance pools with a great deal of discretion in their establishment and operation. State high risk pools are usually operated through state-established nonprofit organizations, with boards overseeing governance consisting of representatives from various entities. State high risk pools in 35 states cap premiums for individuals with costly medical conditions between 150% and 200% of standard rates. These pools operate at a loss and rely on funding from assessments on insurers, general revenue, and federal grants. Coverage in high risk pools mirrors that of the private market. State high risk pools in 35 states offer multiple plans with varying deductibles and cost-sharing requirements. Most pools have lifetime maximums on benefits, while some have annual maximums. Preexisting conditions are typically excluded for 6-12 months. Eligibility criteria are set by states, with many allowing HIPAA-eligible individuals to enroll. HIPAA eligibles must meet specific requirements to qualify for coverage in high risk pools. High risk pools provide health insurance for individuals with costly medical conditions, including HIPAA eligibles and those with specific conditions. Some states offer presumptive eligibility and allow enrollment for those who have experienced coverage denials or premium increases. Participation in high risk pools varies across states, with enrollment numbers ranging from hundreds to thousands of participants. Two-thirds of state high risk pools had low participation below 4,000 individuals in 23 states, while only seven states had more than 10,000 participants. The federal government has provided financial assistance to states through grant programs administered by CMS to establish and support high risk pools. The Trade Act of 2002 allocated $20 million in seed grants to qualifying states for the creation and implementation of high risk pools. In 2003, CMS awarded seed grants to six states: Maryland, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia, totaling $3.3 million. The Trade Act also allocated $80 million to help cover operating losses for existing high risk pools. States must meet certain criteria to qualify for grants, such as limiting premiums and offering multiple coverage options. States have flexibility in determining out-of-pocket costs, benefits, coverage for preexisting conditions, and eligibility criteria. The House passed H.R. 4519, reauthorizing federal grants to state high risk pools through FY2010 with a new funding formula. The formula allocates 40% equally, 30% based on uninsured population, and 30% based on high risk pool population. Grants can cover up to 100% of pool losses, with $15 million for seed grants and $75 million for operational and bonus grants in FY2006. The Senate passed H.R. 4519 without amendment, and President Bush signed it into law on February 10, 2006. The Senate passed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) which included $90 million in appropriations for grants to states for FY2006. President Bush signed DRA into law on February 8, 2006, extending federal funding for the program. CMS awarded seed grants to five states and operational grants to 31 states in 2006. In 2006, CMS awarded seed grants to five states and operational grants to 31 states. Bonus grants were also given to 25 states, exhausting the appropriations. Additional funding was made available in 2008 and 30 states received grants totaling $49,126,500. In 2009, $75,000,000 was provided for grants to state high risk pools. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 provided $55,000,000 in additional appropriations for high risk pools. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) required the establishment of a temporary high risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions. States could choose to run the program themselves or have HHS operate it. 29 states and DC opted to run their own programs, while HHS administered the programs in 21 states under the name Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP)."
