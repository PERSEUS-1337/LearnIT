    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution, with exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. Congress can authorize the military to execute the law in three ways. The Posse Comitatus Act allows the Coast Guard to have law enforcement authority and share information and equipment with civilian agencies. Congress has passed specific statutes for military assistance in cases of insurrection and domestic violence, along with general legislation for sharing information and equipment. This legislation includes grants of authority and restrictions on military assistance to police forces. The Posse Comitatus Act allows the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian agencies, encouraging military activities to benefit civilians. Military equipment and facilities can be used by civilian authorities, with military personnel providing training and expert advice. The authority granted is subject to caveats to ensure it does not undermine US military capability or result in the armed forces making arrests solely for civilian law enforcement purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act allows the armed forces to assist civilian law enforcement, but only when in performance of their military responsibilities. The act does not prohibit incidental benefits to civilian law enforcement as long as the primary purpose is military. The act only prohibits \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force, with limitations on convictions for deliberate violations. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the willful misuse of the Army or Air Force for civilian law enforcement purposes. Violations occur when military forces perform tasks typically assigned to civilian government agencies. The Act allows for military assistance in certain situations, but the primary purpose must be military in nature. The Act's restrictions were developed following incidents at Wounded Knee in 1973, where courts determined improper military involvement based on specific criteria. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the Army and Air Force from executing civilian law, but does not mention the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Guard. The Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is not covered by the Act unless it is under Navy control during war or by presidential order. The Coast Guard, while part of the Department of Homeland Security, is subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy. It is authorized to perform law enforcement functions and is exempt from posse comitatus restrictions. The coverage of the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and civilian employees of the armed forces under the Posse Comitatus Act is unclear. The National Guard, when in federal service, is considered part of the Army or Air Force for Posse Comitatus Act purposes. Historical reflection suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service. Courts have ruled that National Guard members not in federal service are not bound by the Act. The Posse Comitatus Act does not cover soldiers assisting civilian law enforcement while off duty. Congress passed the act in response to military members being used based on civic obligations. Recent decisions focus on whether assistance is primarily for a military purpose. Civilian employees of the armed forces are generally considered part of the armed forces under the act. The Posse Comitatus Act, a criminal statute, restricts military involvement in civilian law enforcement within the United States and its territories. It was enacted by Congress to prevent military usurpation of law enforcement responsibilities over civilians. The Act has been invoked in various legal challenges but has seen few prosecutions. The Posse Comitatus Act is often cited in legal cases as a defense against civil liability or to enjoin military actions. Defendants have used it to exclude evidence or testimony, but courts have not consistently applied an exclusionary rule. While some suggest a need for deterrence in cases of widespread violations, such instances are rare. The Act has been helpful in cases where the government's conduct must be proven lawful, but success in dismissing prosecutions based on military involvement is limited. The Posse Comitatus Act is often used as a defense in legal cases, with the Eighth Circuit stating that a violation could constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. This violation can lead to a Bivens cause of action against federal officers. However, it also provides a defense for the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Plaintiffs facing violations by state or local law enforcement officers may struggle due to qualified immunity. The Act's main impact lies in ensuring compliance by the armed forces. The military's adoption of the Posse Comitatus Act for the Navy and Marines shows their long-standing practice of avoiding involvement in civilian affairs contrary to the act, dating back to the founding of the Republic."
