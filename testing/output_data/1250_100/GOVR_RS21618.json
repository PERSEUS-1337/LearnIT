    "content": "The European Union (EU) is a unique economic and political partnership among 27 countries, formed through treaties and governing institutions. Member states pool sovereignty to harmonize laws, adopt common policies, and share areas of sovereignty like a customs union, single market, common currency (euro), and social/environmental policies. The EU also works on a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and police/judicial cooperation. The integration process began after World War II with six countries and expanded to include more members over the years. The European Union expanded its membership over the years, with countries like the United Kingdom, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joining at different times. The EU underwent institutional reforms through treaties like Maastricht, Amsterdam, and Nice to accommodate the growing complexity of decision-making processes. Critics argued that the Nice Treaty made decision-making more convoluted and less efficient. The Nice Treaty did not address EU's global role or transparency issues. Future enlargement is expected with countries like Iceland, Turkey, and Western Balkans in line for admission. The Lisbon Treaty was created to enact necessary internal reforms after the failed constitutional treaty. EU leaders convened a Convention on the Future of Europe to propose changes for increased democratic legitimacy. The Convention on the Future of Europe was tasked with proposing changes to EU's institutional arrangements to increase democratic legitimacy and global influence. Despite finalizing a draft treaty in 2003, setbacks arose when French and Dutch voters rejected the document in referendums due to concerns about liberal economic ideas undermining social protections. This ultimately led to the treaty's prospects being effectively ended. In January 2007, Germany took over the EU presidency amidst a period of reflection following the rejection of the constitutional treaty. German Chancellor Angela Merkel aimed to revive the reform process with a new treaty deal, supported by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The goal was to restore France's leadership role in Europe and address concerns raised by voters, while preserving as much of the original document as possible. After contentious negotiations at the June 2007 EU Summit, EU leaders announced the outlines of a new \"reform treaty\" that would amend the existing EU treaties. The term \"constitution\" was dropped due to negative associations in some countries. The new treaty, signed in December 2007 in Lisbon, preserved over 90% of the substance of the constitutional treaty. EU leaders aimed for parliamentary ratification to avoid public referendums, but Ireland's national law required a public vote. The Lisbon Treaty was initially hoped to be ratified by all 27 member states before the June 2009 European Parliament elections. The Lisbon Treaty was initially aimed to be ratified by all 27 member states before the June 2009 European Parliament elections. However, Ireland's rejection in a 2008 referendum delayed adoption. After concessions and guarantees were negotiated, Irish voters approved the treaty in a second referendum in October 2009. The Czech Republic's ratification allowed the treaty to come into effect on December 1, 2009. Key changes include the creation of the President of the European Council to chair meetings of EU heads of state. The President of the European Council is elected by member states for a two and a half year term, renewable once. Former Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy was chosen as a manager to coordinate Council activities and ensure policy continuity. His experience in Belgian politics was seen as an asset for the job. The choice reflects a desire to avoid a powerful President overshadowing national leaders. The Lisbon Treaty also created the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to boost the EU's international visibility. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, also known as the EU's chief diplomat, combines the former responsibilities of the Council of Ministers' High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commissioner for External Relations. This individual represents the member states and holds the title of Vice-President of the European Commission, aiming to bring together political and economic influence. The creation of a European External Action Service establishes a new EU diplomatic corps to support the High Representative. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, also known as the EU's chief diplomat, plays a crucial role in driving and overseeing EU foreign policy. Baroness Catherine Ashton was chosen for this position, despite some surprise due to her lack of foreign policy experience. The strengthened High Representative post created by the Lisbon Treaty could be significant, with potential to wield considerable influence. The treaty also promotes steps towards building a stronger common EU defense policy. The Lisbon Treaty aims to establish a common Union defense policy through mutual assistance and structured cooperation among member states. It introduces a streamlined decision-making process with a Qualified Majority Voting system, requiring support from 55% of member states representing 65% of the EU's population. This system will be gradually phased in by 2017, expanding to policy areas previously requiring unanimity, except for the UK which has an opt-out. The Lisbon Treaty aims to establish a common Union defense policy through mutual assistance and structured cooperation among member states. Unanimity will continue to be required in sensitive areas such as taxation and foreign and defense policy. The size of the European Commission will remain at one Commissioner per member state. The treaty increases transparency and democratic accountability by giving the European Parliament more decision-making powers in various policy areas. National parliaments also gain a greater role in EU policy-making. The Lisbon Treaty introduces citizens' initiatives for EU legislative suggestions and makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. Some countries negotiated opt-outs from the Charter. The treaty could have positive implications for U.S.-EU relations, strengthening the EU's partnership with the United States. The EU's ability to speak with one voice on global issues could lead to a more active and assertive role in international affairs. The Lisbon Treaty aims to enhance EU's international role and partnership with the US by streamlining decision-making processes, improving defense capabilities, and potentially facilitating EU enlargement. It could lead to stronger EU-wide policies in security and judicial issues, fostering transatlantic cooperation in homeland security. The Lisbon Treaty aims to streamline EU decision-making processes and enhance its international role, potentially leading to a more united EU that could rival the US in certain policy areas. Critics argue that the treaty may not simplify the EU and could complicate US efforts to rally support for its initiatives. The Lisbon Treaty aims to streamline EU decision-making processes and enhance its international role. Critics are concerned about potential duplication of military structures with NATO and the impact on US-EU trade relations. The European Parliament now has increased powers in trade matters and must approve most international agreements negotiated by the European Commission. The European Parliament gained more authority in trade affairs under the Lisbon Treaty. In February 2010, concerns over data privacy led to the rejection of the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement, later amended and approved in July 2010. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue facilitates engagement between the U.S. House of Representatives and the European Parliament."
