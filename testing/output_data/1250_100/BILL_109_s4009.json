    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to environmental justice. The Act, known as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006,\" is necessary due to the Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, which weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost four decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims of discrimination the right to seek redress in Federal court and questioning the validity of regulations implementing title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress enacted title VI in 1964 to prevent Federal funds from supporting discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. The regulatory process was established to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The regulations under title VI prohibited discrimination and retaliation, and have never been invalidated despite a proposal in 1966. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to benefit those facing discrimination and relied on private attorneys for enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' right to sue for discrimination under Title VI in Federal courts for effective protection of the law. Congress and the Courts have recognized an implied right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including providing the means for enforcing the statutes and establishing a right to attorney's fees in private actions. The Supreme Court in Sandoval had no legal basis for denying a right of action under regulations promulgated under Title VI while permitting it under the statute, as the regulations were congressionally mandated to effectuate the antidiscrimination provisions of the law. The antidiscrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 emphasize the importance of regulations approved by the President. Regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices align with disparate treatment prohibitions, as recognized by the Supreme Court in cases like Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp. Inferences of invidious purpose can be drawn from the totality of relevant facts. The interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact, reinforced by the use of such a standard in enforcing Title VII. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Congress reinstated a private right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services due to discriminatory practices. This action is necessary as Federal agencies may not always take appropriate action, leaving vindication of rights solely to them. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of many claims challenging discriminatory actions under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A waiver of sovereign immunity will allow for a private right of action under this Act. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity's policy or practice causes disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that it is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The demonstration required under Title VII for an alternative employment practice must show that a less discriminatory alternative exists, and if a specific policy or practice does not cause a disparate impact, the entity is not required to prove it is necessary for achieving nondiscriminatory goals. The term 'demonstrates' in this subsection means meeting burdens of production and persuasion. No person in the US shall face discrimination or retaliation for opposing prohibited policies or practices under this title. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Adds a new section 602A to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actions brought by aggrieved persons. SEC. 602A allows aggrieved persons to bring actions against covered entities for intentional discrimination or discrimination based on disparate impact, with the possibility of recovering various forms of relief, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
