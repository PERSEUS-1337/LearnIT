The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez were also kidnapped and tortured. Many US citizens were detained, beaten, and used as \"human shields\" by Iraq. Iraq was classified as a state sponsor of terrorism at the time. The brave American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical, emotional, and mental damage due to state-sponsored torture and terrorism. After the Gulf War, American POWs were welcomed home as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's treatment of captured US service members and amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to hold Iraq accountable for the torture of American POWs and \"human shield\" victims from the Gulf War. The American \"human shield\" victims from the Gulf War sought compensation for their injuries from terrorist countries, including Iraq. 17 Gulf War POWs and their families filed claims in the United States District Court for damages related to their torture and abuse by the Government of Iraq. In 2003, former Gulf War POWs were awarded damages for torture by Iraq, but have not received payment due to a waiver granted by the President. They are unable to pursue their claims further in US courts. In 2003, former Gulf War POWs were awarded damages for torture by Iraq. The President directed the payment of judgments from blocked Iraqi accounts and confiscated remaining assets for Iraq reconstruction. Claims of more than 200 US citizens held hostage in Iraq are pending in court, but they have not been compensated due to a waiver granted by the President. The President granted authority for Iraq under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Article 131 of the Third Geneva Convention prohibits absolving Iraq of liability for torture of prisoners of war. The US has a moral obligation to protect its citizens from torture and hostage-taking. Congress is committed to holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable. If certain claims against Iraq are not settled within 30 days, action will be taken. Upon the expiration of the 30-day period, the President's waiver authority under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 will terminate. The specified cases in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia are included. Adequate settlement involves payment by the Government of Iraq or a US depository institution to certain persons with claims in the applicable case. The Act provides compensation for individuals who were held hostage, with different amounts based on whether they were subjected to torture or not. The compensation ranges from $150,000 to $900,000 for those not subjected to torture, and $2,500,000 for those who were tortured, plus $6,000 for each day held hostage. The Act provides compensation for hostages based on their circumstances. This includes one-third of the amount for spouses or children of qualifying individuals, payment of unsatisfied judgments up to $1,000,000, and definitions for clarity. Definitions provided in this section include terms such as \"hostage,\" \"hostage status,\" \"hostage taking,\" \"person,\" \"torture,\" and \"United States.\" The term \"United States\" refers to the several States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. The term \"United States depository institution\" refers to a depository institution organized under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or the United States. Additionally, it is clarified that certain provisions in specific acts were not intended to remove jurisdiction over cases brought under a particular section of the United States Code. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 did not intend to remove jurisdiction over cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. Section 1083(c) of the same Act applies to cases specified in subsection (b)(2) regardless of any waiver for Iraq."
