The Federal Acquisition Regulation will be modified to address subcontractor payment provisions for prime contractors working on contracts with the United States. This includes requiring prime contractors to pay subcontractors interest penalties for late payments and submit certifications for small business concerns regarding timely payments. The contractor must certify that payments will be made to subcontractors according to the subcontract agreement. Subcontractors can request information on payments made by the United States to the prime contractor. The contracting officer must inquire about subcontractor payments and certification compliance. If the prime contractor is not compliant, action must be taken to ensure timely payment. The contracting officer must take action to encourage timely payment to subcontractors, including disbursement of amounts due directly to subcontractors or through an escrow agent. If the contractor is not compliant with certification requirements, appropriate administrative remedial action must be initiated. Proposed regulations for modifications to the Federal Acquisition Regulation must be issued within 180 days, and final regulations within 270 days of the enactment of this Act, including suspension procedures."
