The Palisades Park Commission is authorized to acquire an open space tract of land from the Sterling Forest Corporation in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. The Commission shall manage the acquired land to enhance protection of watersheds, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. Authorization of appropriations is also granted. The Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994 authorizes appropriations for acquiring land described in section 2 and allows for the transfer of funds to the Commission to carry out the Act. The Act may be cited as the \"Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994.\" The Palisades Interstate Park Commission manages 23 parks and historic sites in New York and New Jersey, totaling over 82,000 acres. Sterling Forest, a biologically diverse area on the New Jersey border, covers approximately 17,500 acres and serves as a crucial watershed area providing clean drinking water for 25% of the state. It is also a significant outdoor recreational asset in the densely populated northeastern United States. Sterling Forest, located in a densely populated metropolitan region, supports a variety of habitats and rare species. Protecting this area would enhance the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and provide recreational opportunities. Stewardship costs are covered by New York and New Jersey, minimizing the need for federal funds. The forest's watershed, recreational, and wildlife qualities make it nationally significant. The northeastern United States faces high demand for open space, especially in the Tri-State region. Acquiring Sterling Forest is crucial for protecting the watershed, wildlife, and recreational opportunities. This investment is cost-effective compared to the expenses of safeguarding drinking water if the forest is developed. The Sterling Forest Reserve in New York is established to protect the watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources in the region. Federal funding is authorized for acquisition costs, and the management will be done by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The definitions of key terms like Commission, Reserve, and Secretary are provided in the Act. The Sterling Forest Reserve is established to protect the region's watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources. Federal funding is authorized for acquisition costs, and management will be handled by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. Key terms are defined in the Act. The Sterling Forest Reserve is established in New York to protect the region's resources. The Reserve consists of approximately 17,500 acres of lands. Federal funds are transferred to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission for land acquisition. The Commission must agree to manage the acquired lands. The Commission must manage lands acquired within the Reserve in accordance with the Act, or convey fee title to the United States. No lands can be acquired with Federal funds without owner consent. If unable to acquire all lands, the Commission must prioritize acquiring designated Wilderness and Conservation Easement Lands. The Commission must convey conservation easements on National Park Service Wilderness Easement Lands and National Park Service Conservation Easement Lands to the United States. The easements will protect wilderness character and restrict development to be compatible with the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Funds for the Commission must be matched by non-Federal sources. The Commission will manage lands in the Reserve in accordance with its authorities and the Act's purposes. Within 3 years, a general management plan must be prepared and submitted for approval. Appropriations are authorized for the Act's implementation, with a limit of $17,500,000 for land acquisition within the Reserve."
