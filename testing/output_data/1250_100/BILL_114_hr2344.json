    "content": "The \"Veterans Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Improvement Act of 2015\" requires that courses of education or training pursued by veterans as part of a rehabilitation program must be approved for purposes of specific titles. The Secretary has the authority to waive this requirement under certain circumstances. This amendment applies to veterans who start a rehabilitation program under chapter 31 of title 38, one year after the enactment of the Act. \"Eligible veterans in vocational rehabilitation programs can receive specially adapted housing from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\" The amendment to title 38, United States Code, allows veterans eligible for rehabilitation programs under chapter 31 to receive assistance under section 2107. The Secretary may waive assistance limitations for veterans meeting specific criteria. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must provide a biennial report to Congress on the use of waiver authority for veterans' rehabilitation programs. Additionally, veterans receiving adaptive housing assistance cannot also receive home adaptation services. These amendments will take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary is granted authority to prioritize vocational rehabilitation services based on need, considering factors like disability ratings and income. Any changes to service prioritization must be submitted to Congress 90 days in advance. Additionally, there will be a reduction in redundancy and inefficiencies in vocational rehabilitation claims processing. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will streamline information technology systems for processing rehabilitation claims under chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code. This includes consolidating payment systems and improving accuracy in accounting for services and outcomes. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2016 for this purpose, with a report due to Congress within 180 days of enactment."
