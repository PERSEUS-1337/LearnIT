    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States needs to prioritize science and mathematics education to maintain a strong scientific and technical enterprise. The current performance of US students in these fields lags behind international peers, and more students need to pursue careers in science and mathematics. The US must recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, especially with advancements like nanotechnology. Loan forgiveness programs may be implemented to attract talent in these fields. A loan forgiveness program can attract students to careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, helping the United States maintain its technological leadership. Establishment of program. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for eligible borrowers who are teachers in STEM fields or professionals in STEM disciplines.
