    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smartphone Theft Prevention Act\". Congress finds that mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Efforts have been made by carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the FCC to address this issue, but more action is needed. Consumers deserve the most secure technology to protect their information. The wireless industry should collaborate with law enforcement to educate consumers on security tools. The industry, law enforcement, and consumers need to adapt rapidly to changing engineering and security needs. The mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should work together to develop solutions that protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft. SEC. 343. FUNCTION FOR STOLEN MOBILE DEVICES. Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a function for stolen mobile devices. In this section, definitions for terms related to mobile devices are provided, including 'account holder', 'commercial mobile data service', 'commercial mobile service', and 'mobile device'. Providers of commercial mobile services must make a function available on mobile devices for stolen mobile devices.

The proposed legislation requires mobile devices to have anti-theft features that allow for remote deletion of data, rendering the device unusable on any network, and preventing unauthorized reactivation. Manufacturers and importers must comply with these standards to ensure the functionality is available to users. Service providers may be exempt from this requirement if they offer equivalent anti-theft technology. The legislation mandates anti-theft features on mobile devices for remote data deletion and prevention of unauthorized reactivation. Manufacturers and importers must comply, while service providers may be exempt if they offer equivalent technology. The Commission can waive requirements for low-cost, voice-only mobile devices. The legislation mandates anti-theft features on mobile devices, with exemptions for low-cost voice-only devices. Providers cannot charge fees for certain functions, and violators may face forfeiture penalties determined by the Commission. The legislation requires anti-theft features on mobile devices, with exemptions for some devices. Violators may face penalties determined by the Commission. The rule does not prohibit manufacturers or service providers from taking additional actions to protect consumers. The Commission may grant temporary exemptions from requirements under the Communications Act of 1934 if a person needs more time to comply."
