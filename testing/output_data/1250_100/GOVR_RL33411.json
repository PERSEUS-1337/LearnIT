    "content": "The Great Lakes watershed, spanning 300,000 square miles across eight U.S. states and one Canadian province, holds nearly 90% of the U.S. surface freshwater and 20% of the world's. It supports 40 million people with jobs, drinking water, and recreation, but faces water quality degradation from agricultural and urban development, posing threats to wildlife and human health. The Great Lakes ecosystem is facing quality degradation from development, leading to habitat changes, non-native species introduction, and contamination. Restoration efforts by the US and Canada governments include more than 30 federal laws focusing on water quality improvement and wildlife habitat restoration. However, there is no detailed plan like the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan for the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, created in 2004, aims to provide strategic direction on federal Great Lakes policy. Chaired by the EPA Administrator, it includes 10 agency and cabinet-level officers. The task force collaborated with various groups to establish the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration, which outlined goals for restoring and protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem. The first goal was to create a restoration strategy within a year, leading to the release of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy in December 2005. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, released in December 2005, aims to address regional issues related to the protection and restoration of the Great Lakes ecosystem. It includes recommendations for actions in eight issue areas, such as aquatic invasive species and contaminated sediments, to be implemented over the next five years. The Strategy outlines specific activities and projects to support existing programs and create new ones for restoration efforts. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy outlines projects in specific locations with estimated costs over five years. It relies on existing resources and new actions for implementation, aiming to improve coordination among stakeholders. Some recommendations may require additional funding, emphasizing that the Strategy does not cover complete restoration of the Great Lakes ecosystem. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy aims to guide decisions affecting the ecosystem, focusing on preventing the introduction and spread of invasive species. Habitat loss and species declines in the Great Lakes basin have been caused by development, agriculture, pollutants, and invasive species, impacting the ecosystem's ability to provide services and support a thriving recreation industry. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy aims to improve fisheries, restore habitats, and protect water quality in the Great Lakes. Recommendations include increasing funding for habitat conservation and species management, implementing wet weather programs, and regulating pollution sources to address degraded water quality and ecosystem degradation. In 1987, 43 Areas of Concern were identified as the most degraded portions of the ecosystem. The goal is to restore all Areas of Concern in the United States by addressing contaminated sediments and promoting sediment treatment technologies. Nonpoint source pollution, such as excessive levels of nutrients, is a major contributor to impaired waters in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Goals of addressing excess sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen loading in the Great Lakes ecosystem include restoring wetlands and buffer habitat, reducing soil loss, and eliminating persistent toxic substances (PTS) discharge. Recommendations involve reducing PTS like mercury, PCBs, and pesticides, conducting research on PTS, and increasing public education. Ecosystem monitoring, research, and indicator development are underfunded, aiming to create a comprehensive ecosystem approach. The Strategy aims to create a network of monitoring systems and conduct Great Lakes research in a coordinated manner. It emphasizes balancing economic, social, and ecological factors for sustainable development. Recommendations include developing indicators of ecosystem health, doubling research funding, and coordinating scientific information. Funding for the Strategy is a contentious issue, with an estimated $20 billion needed from federal and nonfederal sources over the next five years. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem requires $20 billion over the next five years, with $15.3 billion allocated for coastal health. This includes $13.7 billion for wastewater treatment improvements and $1.3 billion for drinking water facilities. Some argue that this funding is excessive compared to other ecosystem restoration projects like the Florida Everglades. The Interagency Task Force suggests funding should come from existing programs, with current federal and state spending on Great Lakes restoration activities totaling $623 million annually. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem requires $20 billion over the next five years, with $15.3 billion allocated for coastal health, including wastewater treatment improvements and drinking water facilities. Proponents argue that the expansive size of the Great Lakes ecosystem justifies the high cost compared to other restoration projects. Funding sources are suggested to come from existing programs, with current federal and state spending on Great Lakes restoration activities totaling $623 million annually. The Collaboration and Strategy aim to improve coordination of ecosystem restoration activities in the Great Lakes among federal, state, and local stakeholders. However, some believe that the Strategy lacks a specific governance structure to address coordination issues and assign restoration responsibilities. The Interagency Task Force is seen as facilitating coordination, but questions about leadership, federal and state roles, and governance remain unanswered. Coordination of restoration activities is a stated function of the task force, but the Strategy itself does not propose a detailed plan for governance. The task force's role includes coordinating ecosystem restoration activities. The executive committee will create plans for implementing the Strategy, serving as an administrative structure. Governance and coordination in large-scale restoration initiatives are addressed in federal and state laws, such as in the Everglades. Federal law required policies explaining stakeholder interactions and implementation plans for restoring the Everglades. Some suggest setting priorities for implementing programs within the Great Lakes Strategy to make it financially feasible. Priorities discussed include restoring coastal waters, controlling invasive species, and addressing pollution. The Strategy could be a platform for introducing federal legislation for Great Lakes restoration, with two main approaches reflected in pending legislation. The Strategy for Great Lakes restoration includes projects that could be funded through grant programs. Proposed authorizations for federal funding in the 109th Congress were $4 billion to $6 billion for restoration activities. Reauthorizing existing federal programs is another approach to enacting portions of the Strategy into federal law. For example, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 reauthorizes appropriations for the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Act of 1990. The Strategy for Great Lakes restoration includes projects funded through grant programs and proposed authorizations for federal funding in the 109th Congress were $4 billion to $6 billion. In the 110th Congress, new strategies are being considered to increase reporting requirements and conduct regional projects. The Strategy envisions itself as the first step towards restoring the Great Lakes in the near term, with goals and recommendations reflecting a five-year span and a $20 billion price tag. The Strategy for Great Lakes restoration aims to restore the ecosystem with a $20 billion price tag, raising questions about the process, cost, timeline, roles, governance, success metrics, and funding increases. The Strategy does not provide answers to these questions but relies on collaboration to address them."
