    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Jackson Multi-Agency Campus Act of 1999\" and includes findings and purposes. The \"Jackson Multi-Agency Campus Act of 1999\" aims to consolidate administrative offices of various agencies in Jackson, Wyoming to improve communication and reduce costs. The Act aims to reduce costs for governments and better serve the public by authorizing federal agencies to develop and maintain a project in Jackson, Wyoming. It also directs the Secretary to convey federally owned land to the town of Jackson and the Game and Fish Commission of Wyoming. The Act authorizes federal agencies to develop a project in Jackson, Wyoming by conveying federally owned land to the town of Jackson and the Game and Fish Commission of Wyoming. The Commission will exchange certain parcels of federally owned land in Jackson for approximately 1.35 acres of land to be used in the construction of the Project, and relinquish reversionary interests of the United States to facilitate the transactions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Game and Fish Commission of Wyoming, construction costs meeting federal standards, a specific Federal parcel of land, a map depicting the project site, and a master plan document. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to a proposed construction project in Wyoming, including the term \"Project\" referring to a multi-agency campus, the term \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of Agriculture, the term \"State parcel\" referring to a specific 3-acre parcel of land, and the term \"town\" referring to the town of Jackson, Wyoming. The curr_chunk states that there is a multi-agency campus project in Jackson, Wyoming. The town may offer to construct an administrative facility for the Bridger-Teton National Forest as part of the Project. If the offer is made within 5 years, the Secretary will convey Federal land in exchange for the completed facility. The Commission may also offer to convey a portion of the State parcel for the construction of an administrative facility for the forest. If this offer is made within 5 years, the Secretary will convey Federal land through a simultaneous conveyance. The Secretary will convey Federal land to the Commission in exchange for a portion of the State parcel, as outlined in this Act. The Secretary will convey portions of the Federal parcel to the town and the Commission as part of the land exchange. The United States will also relinquish all reversionary interests in the State parcel as additional consideration. The exchanged interests must be of equal value. Valuation of Land To Be Conveyed under this Act shall be determined by appraisals acceptable to the Secretary, in accordance with federal standards, and without considering any reversionary interests held by the United States. The Secretary will adjust the acreage of Federal land conveyed to the town based on the value compared to construction costs. If the value is greater, the acreage will be reduced, and if it is less, additional land may be conveyed. The value of Federal land conveyed to the Commission will be equal to the value of the State parcel conveyed to the United States. The boundaries of the Federal land and State parcel may be adjusted to equalize values. Cash payment can be made to equalize values if adjusting parcel sizes or conveying additional land compromises the Project design. SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. Construction of facilities on Federal land within the Project boundaries shall be supervised and managed by the town to approved standards. The town, including contractors, shall have access to the land for construction purposes. Land acquired by the United States under this Act will be governed by national forest site laws. No construction is allowed in wetland areas after the conveyance of Federal land. The Act will include reservations to prevent wetland development on Federal land parcels."
