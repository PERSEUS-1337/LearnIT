    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process, prompting interest in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. Efforts such as the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011 aim to assess these costs and benefits, although it is challenging to accurately measure them. The Office of Advocacy within the Small Business Administration released a report in September 2010 estimating the annual cost of federal regulations in 2008 to be about $1.75 trillion. This estimate was based on previous reports from 1995, 2001, and 2005, which also highlighted the increasing regulatory costs over the years. The $1.75 trillion estimate of federal regulatory costs in 2008 by Crain and Crain has been widely cited as evidence for regulatory reform legislation. The estimate includes costs for economic regulations, environmental regulations, tax compliance, and regulations for occupational safety and health, and homeland security. Economic regulations accounted for over 70% of the total regulatory costs. According to the Crain and Crain report, economic regulations impact businesses by affecting what products and services they produce, how they produce them, and how they are priced and marketed. These regulations include quotas and tariffs on foreign imports that limit competition, restrict production and employment, raise prices, and curtail economic activities. The report used a Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) to estimate the cost of economic regulations, which measures perceptions of government's ability to formulate and implement policies that promote private sector development. The index ranges from -2.5 to +2.5, with +2.5 representing minimal regulation. In 2008, the WGI regulatory quality index score for the United States was +1.579. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to determine the impact of changes in the regulatory quality index on real GDP per capita. They concluded that a one-unit change in the index represented a 9.4% change in GDP per capita. The difference between the US index value and the maximum of +2.5 represented an 8.7% reduction in GDP due to economic regulations. In 2008, the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States was determined by aggregating expert-based measures and surveys, resulting in a score of +1.579. Crain and Crain found that economic regulations reduced real GDP per capita by about $1.236 trillion. The index included measures from Economist Intelligence Unit and Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators. The Global Insight Global Risk Service, Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom, and Institutional Profiles Database provide scores based on factors like tax effectiveness, legislation, export/import regulations, business ownership restrictions, and foreign investment. These scores are determined by experts and aim to assess the business environment in different countries. The Institutional Profiles Database, scored at 0.89 by the French government's Ministry of the Economy, evaluates factors like ease of starting a business and competition. The Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide, scored at 1.00, assesses the investment profile. The Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook, scored at 0.50, gathers input from business people on various factors. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, scored at 0.62, evaluates factors like administrative regulations, tax system, import barriers, competition, ease of starting a company, anti-monopoly policy, and environmental regulations. Some critics question the accuracy of WGI indices, such as the regulatory quality index, but the authors have addressed these concerns. Crain and Crain highlighted the correlation between the WGI indices and an OECD index of economic regulations in their report. They chose the WGI regulatory quality index for their study due to its broader coverage and use of multiple sources. The World Bank cautioned that while indices like the regulatory quality index are useful for cross-country comparisons, they may not be precise enough for specific governance reforms, which require more detailed and country-specific data. The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of the cost of economic regulations depends on the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index. Aart Kraay from the World Bank pointed out issues with how the index was used in their report, stating that it measures perceptions of regulatory quality, not the stringency of regulations. The Regulatory Quality (RQ) index measures perceptions of the overall quality of the regulatory environment, not just stringency. The United States ranks high but countries like Finland and Sweden rank higher. The WGI indicators have margins of error, so rankings are imprecise. Kraay pointed out misinterpretations of the WGI units by comparing scores to a \"minimal amount of regulation.\" Kraay clarified that the WGI scores are not fixed and suggested comparing the US score with countries like Denmark for a more accurate cost calibration of regulations. He also mentioned minor revisions to WGI data, explaining the discrepancy in the regulatory quality index values cited. Using 2008 data, Ireland had the highest regulatory quality index at +1.915, while the US had a value of 1.579. The difference suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP compared to Ireland, costing about $448 billion. Kraay noted that higher index values do not necessarily mean less stringent regulations. Kraay expressed concerns about the quality of the regression analysis by Crain and Crain, stating that high scores on regulatory quality are linked to other policies and institutions affecting GDP per capita. He highlighted the difficulty in isolating the impact of regulation on output from other correlated factors. Crain and Crain defended their empirical evidence, arguing that their regulatory quality index reflects changes in the stringency of regulations in practice. Crain and Crain constructed an index based on stakeholders' perceptions and questions about regulations. They did not compare the US to other countries but estimated the total cost of regulations. The SBA Office of Advocacy had the study peer-reviewed before publication. Williams provided extensive comments on the study, calling it a \"great project\" and expressing concerns about the accuracy of the Regulatory Quality Index in measuring the costs of economic regulations. He suggested that the study might overestimate the total costs of regulation and recommended better explanation and control for other types of regulations to avoid overestimation. In February 2011, the Center for Progressive Reform criticized the Crain and Crain study on economic regulatory costs, questioning the use of the regulatory quality index as a measure for regulatory burden. They raised concerns about the lack of a clear definition of \"economic regulations\" leading to possible double counting, the simplistic relationship assumed between regulatory \"stringency\" and GDP, and the misleading impression of low regulatory quality in the United States despite its high ranking. The study analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita. Economists study the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita, considering factors like resources, labor, technology, and trade. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to examine this relationship, controlling for variables like population and education. Other measures may be more suitable for capturing factors affecting GDP per capita. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita using regression analysis. They used a unique two-stage estimation strategy, omitting statistically insignificant control variables in the second stage. This approach may not fully capture all aspects of capital investment. The two-stage estimation strategy used by Crain and Crain in their analysis of economic regulation's impact on GDP per capita has not been explored in peer-reviewed journals. CRS requested the data used in the study but it was not provided. A sensitivity analysis by CRS showed that the regulatory quality index had no independent effect on GDP per capita, indicating the analysis is highly sensitive to control variables. The relationship between regulatory quality and economic well-being may be too subtle for a seven-year cross-country panel to detect due to slow regulatory evolution and interactions with other public policy instruments. Crain and Crain estimated that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009 by following OMB's approach in their reports to Congress. They converted cost estimates from previous years to 2009 dollars to calculate the cumulative cost of regulations. Crain and Crain used the $280 billion estimate to develop the cumulative cost of regulations, citing a lack of cost estimates for important environmental regulations. They utilized a mix of academic and agency estimates from different time periods, leading to varying methodologies and units of analysis. OMB criticized the practice of summarizing total costs and benefits by combining diverse individual studies as inherently flawed. The approach of combining diverse individual studies to estimate the cumulative cost of regulations was criticized as inherently flawed due to varying quality, methodology, and overlapping time periods. Errors were found in recording information on environmental regulatory costs from OMB reports. The authors criticized OMB's estimate of environmental regulation costs for the period October 2003 through September 2004, stating it was lower than reported. They did not include OMB's estimates of benefits in their report, citing research requirements. Overall, OMB's estimated benefits were higher than costs in most time periods. Crain and Crain assumed OMB's coverage of environmental regulations was comprehensive. Peer reviewer Richard Williams noted that the estimate of environmental regulatory costs should be considered an assumption. Crain and Crain used OMB's upper estimate of environmental costs, believing that some important regulations lacked cost estimates. They mentioned that government agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for overestimating environmental costs, suggesting that industry may influence these estimates. CPR criticized industry cost estimates for not considering technological innovations that reduce compliance costs. They cited studies showing agencies' initial cost estimates are often too high. OMB acknowledged the theory that agencies understate costs and overstate benefits due to self-interest in regulation, but noted limited documentation to support this view. The data used by agencies to estimate costs for regulations may be overstated by regulated entities to discourage regulation. Competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply with regulations using new technologies. Agencies tend to overestimate the benefits of their programs due to technological progress reducing long-term benefits. Crain and Crain compiled data from the IRS and Tax Foundation to estimate compliance costs for federal tax paperwork. The authors estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours completing tax paperwork in 2008, costing approximately $159.6 billion. They used data from the IRS and Tax Foundation to arrive at this figure. The Department of the Treasury accounted for about 7.78 billion burden hours in paperwork. The IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate and about 99.5% of the Treasury estimate. IRS paperwork in 2008 would have been about 7.5 billion burden hours. Certain aspects of how burden hours were monetized by Crain and Crain are unclear, such as assumptions about who completes tax paperwork and where hourly rates were derived from. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, tax preparers received an average salary of $17.34 per hour in May 2009. The average compensation for tax preparers is estimated to be just over $23 per hour. Multiplying 7.5 billion burden hours by $23 per hour yields a total cost of about $172.5 billion, which is $12.9 billion higher than the Crain and Crain estimate. There is a debate on whether tax paperwork should be included in estimates of regulatory costs, with OMB not including it in their reports to Congress. John D. Graham from OIRA stated that filling out tax forms is a result of the tax code itself, not regulations. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within OMB highlighted that the IRS paperwork burden is mainly driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, leading to increased taxpayer burden. Statutorily driven revisions and changes in tax laws have significantly added to the IRS burden hours. Additionally, factors like economic and population growth have further increased the overall IRS burden hours. The authors estimated the total cost of occupational safety and health regulations and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. This included workplace regulations related to safety and health, primarily from OSHA, as well as homeland security costs. The estimated cost of occupational safety and health and homeland security regulations in 2008 was approximately $75.2 billion. Crain and Crain obtained the estimate from OMB's 2009 report, with costs for OSHA regulations ranging from $362 million to $389 million. The authors used the upper end of OMB's estimated cost range for these regulations. The estimate for homeland security costs was obtained from page 18 of OMB's 2009 report. The OMB's 2009 report estimated that homeland security regulations imposed an annual cost on the economy of $4.2 billion to $8.6 billion, which converted to $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion in 2009 dollars. Crain and Crain used the upper end of OMB's estimated cost range for these regulations. The Center for Progressive Reform's analysis questioned the authors' use of cost estimates for occupational safety and health regulations. The Joseph M. Johnson study and agency estimates of compliance costs may overstate true costs as they rely on information from regulated industries. CPR criticized the Johnson study for inflating OSHA's cost estimates and including fines as regulatory costs. W. Mark Crain estimated federal regulatory costs at $1.11 trillion in 2004 and $1.75 trillion in 2008, attributing the increase to a change in methodology. The methodology used in estimating the cost of economic regulations showed an increase in costs between 2004 and 2008. Congress has required OMB to submit annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years, with specific requirements outlined in various appropriations acts. The OMB is required to provide an accounting statement with estimates of total costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork in the President's budget. The estimates of regulatory costs and benefits varied significantly from year to year, with a notable increase in benefits estimates in 1998. The OMB estimated the cost of social regulations between $146 billion and $229 billion, with benefits ranging from $254 billion to nearly $1.8 trillion. The significant increase in benefits in 1998 was mainly due to the inclusion of an EPA estimate for the Clean Air Act, which raised the benefits estimate from $3.5 trillion to $1.8 trillion. The EPA estimate was controversial, with doubts about its accuracy. OMB cautioned that it was challenging to precisely estimate the total costs and benefits of all federal regulations. The OMB highlighted methodological problems in measuring the total costs and benefits of federal regulations, including unclear baselines, difficulty in attributing costs or benefits, technological changes affecting accuracy, and challenges in aggregating results from different studies. The OMB did not include \"transfer\" rules or costs associated with tax paperwork in its estimates of total regulatory costs. It also excluded rules published after 1987 without cost-benefit analyses. OMB's reports since 2001 focus on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. The OMB's reports focus on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. The reports provide estimates of the costs and benefits of regulations meeting specific criteria reviewed during certain time periods. For example, the 2002 report estimated total costs of $50-53 billion and benefits of $48-101 billion for rules reviewed from 1995 to 2001. The 2003 report estimated costs of $37-43 billion and benefits of $146-230 billion for rules reviewed from 1992 to 2002, with EPA rules contributing significantly to the benefits. Each report covers rules from the previous 10 years meeting the specified criteria. The OMB decided to present data for only certain rules during a limited time-frame due to the inconsistent and aged nature of many studies used for aggregate estimates. They believe estimates of costs and benefits of regulations issued over ten years ago are unreliable for current policy decisions. Therefore, they chose not to reproduce aggregate estimates in the draft report. The total costs and benefits of all federal rules in effect could be much larger. Estimates for rules adopted prior to the 10-year period are considered irrelevant now. John D. Graham emphasized the unreliability of past attempts to estimate aggregate costs of regulations. The Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion in the past is not accurate for regulatory accounting. It is a rough indicator of regulatory activity based on outdated data from the 1970s to the 1990s. These estimates may no longer be appropriate for official accounting statements due to changes over the years. The estimated costs and benefits of regulations are not accurately accounted for, with incomplete information and lack of transparency in the data and methods used. The idea of requiring agencies to provide annual estimates of costs and benefits for all rules is deemed unworkable. OMB's 2009 report to Congress provided estimates of total annual benefits and costs of regulations reviewed over a 10-year period. The OMB reviewed 98 regulations from 1998 to 2008 with estimated costs ranging from $51 billion to $60 billion and benefits from $126 billion to $663 billion. The estimates were not a complete account of all regulations during that period. OMB only presented information for a 10-year period due to the relevance of pre-regulation estimates. Aggregating benefit and cost estimates of individual regulations provides insight, but the resulting estimates are not precise or complete. Regulatory impact analyses vary in rigor and assumptions, making comparisons difficult. Crain and Crain's estimates of annual regulatory costs in 2008 were larger than OMB's due to different methodologies. Crain and Crain included costs for all rules, while OMB only included major rules meeting specific criteria over a 10-year period. Crain and Crain's estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008, amounting to $1.75 trillion, heavily relies on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States. However, there are concerns about the validity and reliability of this estimate, as one of the authors of the index has pointed out misinterpretations by Crain and Crain. Crain misinterpreted the index, leading to concerns about the validity of their estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008. Other commenters also raised concerns about the use of the regulatory quality index to measure economic regulations. Crain and Crain defended their approach, stating that the index indicates the stringency of a country's regulations. The World Bank warns that the regulatory quality index may not be useful for specific governance reforms in different country contexts. Crain and Crain's estimates for various regulations were criticized for using outdated data and a flawed approach. They only considered the highest cost estimates from OMB reports, believing government agencies underestimate regulatory costs. OMB has raised concerns about agencies' conservative estimates of regulatory costs, stating that older estimates are of \"questionable relevance.\" Their reports to Congress only include information on major rules issued in the past 10 years, as they believe older estimates are unreliable for policy decisions. OMB also noted that incremental costs of regulations tend to decrease over time as business practices and consumer expectations evolve. The OMB raised concerns about agencies' conservative estimates of regulatory costs, stating that older estimates are of \"questionable relevance.\" They believe that over time, the true costs and benefits of health, safety, and environmental regulations decrease due to evolving business practices and consumer expectations. OMB also mentioned that compliance costs for regulations over ten years old may not be significantly reduced if those regulations were to disappear overnight. The authors of a report on federal regulations did not include the benefits of regulations in their study, despite readily available information from OMB reports. They also did not consider tax paperwork in the same category as regulatory costs, as OMB does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs and benefits. Crain and Crain did not include regulatory benefits in their study as requested by the SBA Office of Advocacy. Executive Order 12866 mandates agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulations, aiming to maximize net benefits. OMB reports show that estimated benefits of federal regulations generally exceed costs. In FY2009, costs for major rules ranged from $3.7 billion to $9.5 billion, with benefits between $8.6 billion and $28.9 billion. In FY2010, costs ranged from $6.5 billion to $12.5 billion, with benefits between $23.3 billion and $82.3 billion. Agencies often quantified costs but not benefits in rules. Crain and Crain's estimate of federal regulations costing $1.75 trillion in 2008 has been cited for regulatory reform. However, they clarify that their report is not a decision-making tool for lawmakers. Information on regulatory costs alone provides only one piece of information for policymakers to consider. If the monetized benefits of regulations exceed the costs, then the regulations may be considered justified. In an effort to assess the sensitivity of Crain and Crain's results, CRS ran a linear regression using data from 30 OECD countries over the period 2002-2008. They used similar variables like GDP per capita, regulatory quality index, broadband penetration rates, country population, and foreign trade percentage. Data was obtained from the OECD website. In their analysis, the coefficient for primary school enrollment had a negative sign, suggesting a decrease in GDP per capita as enrollment increased. This unexpected result may be due to \"aging pyramid\" demographic effects. CRS added variables for population under 14 and over 65 to address these effects. The analysis used a cross-country fixed effects panel estimator with logarithms of variables, and estimation results were obtained using Stata 11 xtreg procedure with robust standard errors. The estimated coefficients in Table A-1 show that the regulatory quality index and population have insignificant effects on GDP per capita. Shifting the US regulatory quality to Ireland's level is estimated to increase GDP by $2.14 per capita. However, due to the imprecise nature of the estimates, this effect is also imprecise. The model results show that most of the variance is due to differences among countries rather than within countries over time. Estimating the effects of variables like regulatory environment in economically advanced countries using highly aggregated country-level data may be challenging. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific changes in regulatory environment could be more effective in understanding the impact of regulation on economic activity."
