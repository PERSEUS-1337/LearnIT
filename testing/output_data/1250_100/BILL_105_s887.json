    "content": "The Act titled \"National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1997\" is established for the purpose of recognizing the significance of the Underground Railroad. Congress finds that the Underground Railroad was a significant expression of the American civil rights movement, bridging divides of race, religion, and nationality to uphold ideals of liberty and freedom. The Underground Railroad Advisory Committee conducted a study to establish a national commemorative program for education and reconciliation. The Underground Railroad Advisory Committee found that many important sites are in danger of being lost, while others have high potential for preservation in various states. No single site fully represents the Underground Railroad, as its story involves networks and regions across the country. Partnerships between the Federal Government, other levels of government, and the private sector are crucial for preservation efforts. The National Park Service can play a vital role in facilitating the national commemoration of the Underground Railroad. The story and significance of the Underground Railroad can best engage the American people through a national program that links historic buildings, structures, sites, routes, interpretive centers, museums, and programs in a unified and flexible manner. The purposes of this Act are to recognize the importance of the Underground Railroad, the sacrifices made by slaves seeking freedom, and the sacrifices made by those who helped them. The National Park Service is authorized to coordinate activities commemorating the Underground Railroad's history, significance in the civil rights movement, and relevance in promoting racial harmony and national reconciliation.
