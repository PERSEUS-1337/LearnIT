    "content": "The \"Access to College Education (ACE) Act of 1997\" aims to address the rising tuition costs at public colleges and universities, which have outpaced household income and the cost of consumer goods. The Act emphasizes the importance of a well-educated workforce for America's future, especially in high-tech, high-wage jobs. It also highlights the need for parents to have information and assistance in saving for their children's higher education, including through prepaid college tuition programs. Title X of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish a new part for administrative support for state prepaid tuition programs, authorizing a grant program. The Secretary will establish a grant program to support State prepaid tuition programs, with each State eligible for a single grant. States must submit an application with a State plan outlining the type of prepaid tuition plan offered and the institutions where funds can be used. The prepaid tuition program must disclose details such as the application process, tuition expenses, investment methods, disbursement procedures, state aid eligibility, actuarial projections, and fund investment information. The State must provide regular disclosures of actuarial projections for tuition costs and prepaid tuition fund investments. The funds can be used for administrative expenses, office space, equipment, public disclosure, advertising, and public education on savings for higher education. States receiving grants must share information to help other states improve prepaid tuition programs. The State receiving a grant must provide requested information to the Secretary for the development of its prepaid tuition program. The Secretary will collect and correlate data from existing programs, including state population, number of postsecondary institutions, average costs, and current participants. Studies of prepaid college tuition programs will be collected and shared with states applying for grants to help them administer successful programs. $20,000,000 is authorized for grants under this section. The Secretary is authorized to make grants totaling $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and subsequent years as needed."
