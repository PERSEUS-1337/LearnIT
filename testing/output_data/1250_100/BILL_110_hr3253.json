It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a section on data systems and requirements. The Act titled \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" requires states receiving funds to develop a longitudinal data system for public charter schools within 4 years. States must also form an advisory committee within 6 months to advise on the system's development and implementation, with members having experience in data systems. The \"Measuring and Evaluating Trends for Reliability, Integrity, and Continued Success Act\" mandates states to establish a longitudinal data system for public charter schools. The system must include a unique statewide student identifier, enrollment information, demographic data, program participation details, academic assessment scores matching ability, and information on non-participating students. The statewide longitudinal data system for public charter schools must include student-level data on entrance and exit from the education system, a statewide audit system for data quality, a unique teacher identifier, student transcript information, and the ability to link preschool through grade 12 data to higher education systems for college enrollment and attainment. The data system required for public charter schools includes student-level data on college enrollment, placement, and performance assessments. It must ensure privacy of student records, effective data architecture, and the ability to link student records across databases for reporting at various educational levels. The data system for public charter schools must include student-level data for reporting under the Act, support longitudinal analysis of student achievement, and allow for program evaluations. It should also ensure interoperability with other systems, electronic portability of data, professional development for users, and researcher access to data while maintaining privacy. The data system for public charter schools must include student-level data for reporting under the Act, support longitudinal analysis of student achievement, and allow for program evaluations. It should also ensure interoperability with other systems, electronic portability of data, professional development for users, and researcher access to data while maintaining privacy. The data described in subsection (c)(7) should not diminish employee rights under any other laws or agreements. States with preexisting data systems can use them if they meet the requirements. Prior to implementation, a state must submit an audit certifying compliance. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008 and the following three years for this purpose. After reserving funds, each State receives an allocation based on enrollment. States must apply for funds, and penalties may apply for lack of progress. Funds can be used for data system certification and specific purposes. The funds received can be used to maintain, operate, and upgrade data systems, provide data integrity training, offer professional development on data collection and usage, disseminate best practices for teaching and learning, and align data systems with student information management systems. The Secretary reserves 1 percent of funds for a State education data center grant. Nonprofit entities can apply for the grant and must seek additional funds to support the center's operation. Application process includes providing assurance of seeking private funds. The State education data center grant requires a plan for financial support from private funds and experience in education data system development. Grant funds are used for technical assistance, best practice dissemination, and serving as a central data repository. Entities receiving grant funds must make data publicly available in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974."
