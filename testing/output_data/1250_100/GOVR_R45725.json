It protects U.S. shipyards and sailors but is debated for raising costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues include Puerto Rico's recovery, the El Faro sinking, and oil transportation debates. National security goals and a national maritime strategy are also under scrutiny. The Jones Act of 1920 requires U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport, protecting U.S. shipyards and sailors. Laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet date back to the First Congress in 1789. Congress enacted precursor laws to the Jones Act in 1817. In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act, disallowing foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. The U.S. lost its shipbuilding advantage in the late 1800s as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. vessel trade share, leading to the \"free ship\" movement allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag. Opponents argued that higher U.S. crew costs would hinder the resurgence of U.S. vessel trade. In 1912, Congress enacted a measure allowing foreign-built vessels to qualify for U.S.-flag international service. This domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages since then. In the late 1800s, Congress tightened coastwise transport language in response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. For example, a shipper loaded goods on a foreign-flag ship bound for Antwerp, Belgium, then transferred to another foreign-flag ship bound for Los Angeles to save on freight charges. Similarly, shipments from Seattle to Alaska often went through Vancouver, Canada. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893 and 1898 to prohibit routing cargo through foreign ports. Despite this, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. Senator Wesley Jones of Washington amended the coastwise language in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle, covering shipments \"by land and water\" between \"U.S. points.\" The debate leading up to the Jones Act passage included the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The minority report to a 1919 House committee report expressed the view that banning foreign-built ships would result in more costly domestically built ships, hindering American merchants from acquiring ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally. The cost differential between U.S.-built ships and foreign-built ships has been increasing over the years. U.S. shipyard prices were double those of foreign yards in the 1950s and tripled by the 1990s. Today, a U.S.-built tanker may cost four times the global price, while a U.S.-built container ship could cost five times more. This cost disparity has also affected the Department of Defense's plans for military sealift ships, leading to the purchase of more used foreign-built cargo ships. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign shipyards due to the lack of vessel exports. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined maritime policy goals. U.S.-flag ships have higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships, with crewing, insurance, and maintenance being key cost elements. A 2011 study by MARAD found that the average operating cost of a U.S.-flag ship was 2.7 times greater than a foreign-flag ship, with the cost differential increasing since then. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the need for a strong U.S. merchant marine to avoid dependency on foreign vessels. The Jones Act applies to domestic waterborne shipments, not international trade. The act aimed to develop and maintain a merchant marine owned and operated by U.S. citizens. The Jones Act requires that U.S. citizen crewing and ownership rules apply to domestic waterborne shipments, with exemptions for certain U.S. territories. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements for vessels, while Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity eligibility. The Jones Act mandates U.S.-built vessels for domestic waterborne shipments, with the Coast Guard defining U.S.-built criteria. The Act does not specify what constitutes a U.S.-built vessel, leaving it to the Coast Guard to determine based on hull and superstructure fabrication in the U.S. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards often import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull. Parts or components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity can be manufactured abroad but must be attached in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard allows up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be manufactured abroad, including propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, rudders, and watertight closures. Steel products in standard forms are also permitted. The Coast Guard permits steel products in standard forms to be imported with no weight limit, but custom shaping and cutting must be done in a U.S. shipyard. Shipyard unions refer to vessels built with foreign components as \"kit ships.\" In 2018, Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish determination letters detailing permissible foreign components. Shipyard unions sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over the interpretation of the statute, but the court sided with the Coast Guard, citing consistency with the Treasury Department's interpretation since the late 1800s. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to use foreign components in building Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partnered with a South Korean company for ship designs and materials. The use of foreign components could increase ship costs but not allowing them could harm the domestic fleet. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships. CBP has determined that a cruise ship serving a U.S. port does not have to be Jones Act-compliant if it has visited a distant foreign port. This regulatory interpretation dates back to a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service. Foreign-flag cruise ships can make round trips from a U.S. port and visit other U.S. ports as long as they include a visit to a nearby foreign port. The Jones Act does not apply to cruise ships visiting foreign ports like Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the same dock. \"Voyages to nowhere\" involve trips within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters, where vessels must be Jones Act-compliant. If the vessel goes beyond 3 miles into international waters, it does not need to comply with the Jones Act. The Jones Act applies to charter fishing boats in international waters, as determined by a 1936 ruling. CBP's interpretation includes defining a passenger as anyone aboard who is not a crew member or owner. This affects various industries like construction and offshore oil markets. The Jones Act applies to offshore oil operations, including lightering of oil tankers and supply vessels servicing oil platforms. CBP determines U.S. points based on proximity to shore and attachment to the seabed. Within 3 nautical miles of shore, vessels must be Jones Act-compliant. Offshore oil rigs attached to the seabed within 200 miles are also considered U.S. points. In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. CBP defines \"vessel equipment\" as necessary for navigation, operation, or maintenance of a vessel. OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must be Jones Act-compliant if the rig is attached to the seabed. The Jones Act applies to supplies and rig workers on rigs attached to the seabed, while foreign-flagged vessels can be used for installing rig equipment, geophysical surveying, and diving inspections. CBP's interpretations guide offshore wind farm developers, with the nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels hindering development, especially in deeper waters. U.S. wind developers currently transport equipment from foreign countries due to the lack of Jones Act-compliant TIVs. The Jones Act applies to offshore wind farm developers, with CBP's interpretation allowing for non-Jones Act compliant vessels to transport equipment if transformed into a new product at an intermediate foreign port. This exemption has enabled a Texas oil producer to blend products in a Bahamian facility before shipping to New York using foreign-flag tankers. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements and exempting certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels sold to foreign owners could not requalify as Jones Act-eligible, providing protection for Jones Act carriers. In 1940, towing vessels were included under the Jones Act, and in 1988, waterborne transport was specified by Congress. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, including waivers when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available. For example, passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any U.S. port is exempt if no Jones Act-qualified operator can provide service. Congress has also permitted foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in 1996 and 2011 due to the lack of Jones Act fleet availability. In response to vessel shortages, Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, including waivers for specific situations such as oil spill cleanup operations and innovations in vessel designs. One exemption was for iron ore carried on the Great Lakes during the 1940s and another for a bumper grain harvest in 1951. Congress also exempted specific barges from the Jones Act in 1971 for a technology known as Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH), which is no longer in use. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty container ships. The Jones Act exempts the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports for international shipments, allowing foreign-flagged carriers to reposition their equipment along U.S. coastlines. This exemption highlights the need for Jones Act-compliant ships for transshipment of loaded international containers, impacting the development of marine highways. The lack of transshipment services in the U.S. increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress has also enacted exemptions for specific vessels under certain circumstances. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 specific vessels in 16 separate legislative acts. These waivers are typically found in maritime-related legislation and are often for vessels that are not commercially significant, such as small cargo or passenger vessels owned by nonprofit entities. One exception was the 2011 waivers granted to three LNG tankers. Many vessels require waivers due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements. The Jones Act requires vessels to meet specific ownership requirements, with waivers granted for technicalities like missing records. Waivers have been issued for national defense reasons during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Libya. Additionally, waivers have been granted for fuel resupply after natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In the aftermath of major hurricanes from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, Congress involved MARAD in checking for Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting waivers. National defense waivers have been granted for the lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet, allowing foreign-flag vessels for specific transport needs. However, Customs denied a waiver request in 1992 for transporting replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships using a foreign-flag heavy-lift vessel. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement advised that not granting a waiver for offshore operators created a safety hazard. CBP stated that national defense waivers would not be issued for economic reasons. In 1976, Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to vulnerability of offshore supply lines. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. In 2018, the United States exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources, and shipped broke down by foreign-flag and Jones Act tankers. The U.S. has begun exporting LNG by ship while still importing it, with no domestic shipments. Puerto Rico seeks a Jones Act waiver for LNG imports. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, with recent controversies focusing on oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. The Jones Act-compliant fleet in March 2018 consisted of 99 oceangoing ships, primarily tankers, dry cargo vessels, and general-cargo vessels. The fleet has significantly decreased in size since 1950, with larger ships but less aggregate carrying capacity. The U.S. merchant marine's carrying capacity (DWT) is still less than in 1950, with a notable drop in fleet size in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, stating that the domestic fleet is too small, old, and unproductive. Despite economic advantages, domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines, even though they can move more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where shippers have limited alternatives. Despite its goal of sustaining a growing merchant marine, the fleet does not meet the policy objectives of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the best equipped vessels. Not all ship designs are represented in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet lacks suitable types of vessels such as project cargo or heavy-lift vessels for carrying oversized equipment. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move specialized cargo on foreign-flag vessels due to the higher cost structure of Jones Act operators. The two dry bulk ships in the fleet are mostly inactive, possibly due to their age exceeding the global fleet's economic life. The Jones Act fleet lacks LNG tankers despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom. The high cost of U.S.-built ships led to the development of articulated tug barges (ATBs) for coastwise trade. Over 150 ATBs are in operation, but they are less reliable and efficient than tankers for longer voyages. ATBs pose a higher risk of grounding and provide less time to prevent oil spills from reaching shorelines. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in a hurricane in 2015, had open lifeboats due to being built in 1975. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet, noting that many ships are in substandard condition and are at risk of breakdown. The Jones Act fleet faces maintenance challenges, with some older ships experiencing issues like hull cracks. Newer ships were built to meet emissions requirements. About one-third of oceangoing Jones Act vessels are over 21 years old. Great Lakes fleet ships are even older, with the largest ones built between 1972 and 1981. The Great Lakes fleet, built between 1972 and 1981, consists of older ships, some dating back to the 1940s or 1950s. Ships on the Great Lakes have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Canadian fleet, similar in age to the Jones Act fleet, saw no new ships added due to a 25% import tariff on newly constructed vessels. After the tariff was repealed in 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships were built for service on the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes fleet consists of older ships, some dating back to the 1940s or 1950s, with longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. Thousands of tugs and barges carry dry and liquid bulk commodities on the nation's inland rivers, dominated by the export of corn and soybeans and domestic movement of coal. Overall tonnage on the system has been flat or declining slightly since 1990. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires that vessels engaged in dredging in U.S. waters be U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed. Congress amended the Jones Act in 1988 to include any valueless material as \"merchandise\" transported domestically by vessel. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators has raised the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged. Factors contributing to cost increases include a limited supply of dredging vessels, rising fuel and steel costs, labor expenses, and stricter environmental regulations. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms, which have larger and more modern fleets. The U.S. privately owned hopper dredge fleet is aging, with three-quarters over 20 years old, while European fleets are younger. When the Army Corps bids harbor work, U.S. firms often bid as the sole bidder. Mobilization and demobilization costs can make up over one-third of total project costs in the U.S. market. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels for transport, which are not available in the Jones Act fleet. The offshore supply vessel fleet in 2017 consisted of about 1,800 vessels, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, with annual construction averaging 32 vessels over the last decade. Since 1920, Congress has enacted programs to designate fleets for sealift support, but there are perceived shortcomings in the Jones Act fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which has yet to be implemented. The shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises doubts about its ability to crew a reserve sealift fleet effectively. The Jones Act oceangoing ships' crews could support military sealift, with about 29% of mariners coming from these ships. The remaining mariners would be from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and the Military Sealift Command fleet. MARAD estimates there is a sufficient mariner pool for the reserve sealift fleet. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for a prolonged sealift effort lasting up to 180 days. The mariner pool is barely sufficient for an immediate surge but insufficient for longer sealift efforts, a consistent finding over decades. Previous assessments in 2004 and 1991 also highlighted the inadequacy of the mariner pool. Despite the Jones Act's emphasis on a commercial fleet for wartime sealift, other military sealift fleets like the RRF, MSC, and MSP have been established. The RRF, MSC, and MSP are military sealift fleets established with predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, requiring an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. MSC ships are controlled by TRANSCOM and mostly crewed by civilian mariners. MSP ships receive an operating subsidy and rely on government cargoes. MARAD advocates for the use of MSP ships before MSC ships for military operations. The military sealift fleet, predominantly composed of foreign-built ships, could be required to be built domestically to share the higher cost nationally. This would increase the mariner pool available for sealift support and boost repair and maintenance work for U.S. shipyards. Designing sealift ships to military specifications would provide flexible capabilities for various operational needs. The military sealift fleet consists of versatile ships like product tankers, Ro/Ro ships, and container ships, in conflict with the trend towards specialized and larger commercial ships. General cargo ships with onboard cranes have been replaced by container ships, leading to potential challenges in foreign ports without shore-based cranes. Some ports may not have sufficient depth for the largest container ships. The military sealift fleet faces challenges due to the trend towards specialized commercial ships, such as \"pure car carriers\" and LNG-fueled engines, which may not meet military requirements. There is a growing disparity between ideal vessel designs and crew skill sets. The Jones Act aims to preserve a shipyard industrial base for shipbuilding and repair. The U.S. shipbuilding industry faces challenges due to limited economies of scale, with only a few oceangoing ships built annually and gaps between orders. Shipyards building smaller vessels struggle with insufficient dry docks for large ship repairs. The government-owned sealift fleet is aging and in need of repair, but there is a shortage of large dry docks to service it. The Maritime Administrator reports an insufficient number of large dry docks for servicing the sealift fleet, causing delays in readiness. Some reserve fleet ships have failed safety inspections, with rusted hulls making them unseaworthy. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the fleet includes building new vessels, repairing existing ships, and purchasing used foreign-built ships. Repairing vessels has been costly and time-consuming, prompting consideration of accelerating the purchase of foreign-built ships. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards to support U.S. shipyards. The 2011 MARAD study found that U.S.-flag international trading ships often have repairs done in foreign shipyards due to lower costs, even with the 50% duty. This practice still continues in 2018 according to a U.S.-flag operator."
