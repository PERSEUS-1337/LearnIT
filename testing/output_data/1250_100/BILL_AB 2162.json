    "title": "AB 2162",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act (Chapter 6.3) is added to the Fish and Game Code to conserve oak woodlands for various benefits such as enhancing scenic beauty, promoting ecological balance, and sustaining habitat for wildlife and plant species in California. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodlands in California to maintain habitat for wildlife species. The state recognizes the threat of habitat loss due to pathogens and parasites, emphasizing the need for immediate conservation efforts to preserve oak ecosystem continuity. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodlands in California by ensuring land use decisions are based on scientific information, restoring the state's diverse natural resource, and providing permits for oak tree removal. Key terms include canopy cover, oak removal, oak removal permit, oak removal plan, and oak tree definition. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act defines key terms such as oak tree, oak woodland, parcel, riparian hardwood, timberland, and watercourse. These definitions are crucial for conserving oak woodlands in California and regulating land use decisions. In California, the Oak Woodlands Protection Act requires an oak removal plan and permit for removing valley oak trees over 10 inches in diameter or 10 or more oak trees of similar size from oak woodlands. The plan must be approved by the director or regional managers, prepared by a registered professional forester, and submitted on a prescribed form. Applications for oak removal permits must be on a prescribed form. The commission will establish regulations by June 30, 2016, including an application fee to cover processing costs. The fee will be deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund for department use. An oak removal plan must be included in the application for an oak removal permit, detailing parcel use, canopy cover percentages, oak species to be removed, habitat mitigation measures, and other required information. The director's approval of the permit is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act, and certain criteria must be met for approval. The director cannot approve an oak removal permit if the application does not comply with regulations, findings cannot be made, more than 10% of oak canopy would be removed, trees are near water sources, information is incorrect, applicant lacks property interest, or if it violates laws. Dead tree removal and creating fire breaks are exceptions. An applicant can appeal the director's denial of an oak removal permit to the commission within 15 days. The commission will hear the appeal within 60 days unless a later date is agreed upon. A person can seek declaratory and equitable relief to restrain violations of oak removal regulations. Preliminary relief will be issued upon showing a violation. Oak removal permits approved under this chapter are considered construction projects. In civil actions, it is not necessary to prove irreparable damage or inadequate legal remedy when seeking a restraining order or injunction. The permittee must record the approved permit in each county before starting operations. Violations of this chapter may result in a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation, separate from any other penalties imposed by law. In civil actions brought under this section, the court considers various factors in determining civil penalties, including the nature of the violation, ability to pay, prior history of violations, and economic benefit gained. The Attorney General or other authorized parties may bring civil actions on behalf of the State of California, and collected penalties are apportioned accordingly. Fifty percent of funds from civil actions are distributed to the county treasurer and the Wildlife Conservation Board. The funds are used for wildlife conservation and legal actions. Section 21083.4 of the Public Resources Code is repealed. As part of Section 21080.1, counties must assess if a project may impact oak woodlands. If significant effects are possible, mitigation options include conserving oak woodlands with easements, planting trees, and restoring former oak woodlands. Maintenance of planted trees lasts seven years and can only fulfill half of the mitigation requirement. Contribute funds to the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund for purchasing conservation easements. Counties can use grants for oak conservation planning. Exemptions apply to certain projects. Exemptions from oak conservation regulations include approved Natural Community Conservation Plans, affordable housing projects in urban areas, conversion of oak woodlands on agricultural land, and projects under specific sections of the Public Resources Code. Compliance with oak conservation measures deems a project in compliance with relevant regulations. The Legislature clarifies that the section does not alter requirements of the division except for impacts on oaks and oak woodlands. It also does not prevent the application of Section 21081 to a project. The section and related regulations do not limit a public agency's ability to comply with the law. No reimbursement is needed for local agencies or school districts due to this act, as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
