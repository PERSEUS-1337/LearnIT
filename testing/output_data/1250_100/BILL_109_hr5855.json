    "content": "MASTER TEACHER EXCLUSION. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on certain wages of certified master teachers. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code excludes 25 percent of wages earned by certified master teachers at qualified schools or Head Start programs. A certified master teacher is eligible for this exclusion during a 4-year certification period, with a limit of one certification period per teacher. States cannot certify more than 10 percent of public school teachers as certified master teachers. The term 'qualified school in need of improvement' refers to schools employing certified master teachers, with specific criteria for eligibility. A 'school in need of improvement' is defined as a public elementary or secondary school that requires assistance to enhance its educational standards. A 'school in need of improvement' is a public elementary or secondary school identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An 'eligible teacher' for this program must have at least 5 years of teaching experience, be highly qualified, hold a master's degree, and have advanced certification in their state's licensing system or from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The text chunk discusses the certification period for certified master teachers and the requirement for them to include the state of certification on their tax return. The section does not apply to taxable years after December 31, 2013. The Secretary of the Treasury will report to Congress annually from 2007 to 2013 on the number of certified master teachers in each state who received income exclusions under section 139B of the Internal Revenue Code. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
