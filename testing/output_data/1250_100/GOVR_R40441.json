    "content": "The Navy scheduled training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar. Environmentalists claimed harm to whales, leading to litigation. The district court initially granted an injunction, later modified to allow sonar use with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, stating that the plaintiffs failed to show a \"likelihood\" of irreparable injury and that the Navy's interest in training its sailors outweighed the potential harm to marine mammals. The Court reversed the decision below and vacated the preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, vacating the preliminary injunction. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit, emphasizing the national security interest in the training exercises. The Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions was rejected, with the Court highlighting the importance of military training over potential environmental violations. The Forest Service promulgated regulations under the ARA, precluding notice, comment, and appeals for projects covered by categorical exclusions. The Ninth Circuit invalidated the regulations in a challenge to a timber sale, citing Article III standing based on injury in fact. The Ninth Circuit found that plaintiffs had standing due to injury in fact, specifically the deprivation of procedural rights and potential reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests. The court also ruled that the Forest Service's regulations conflicted with the ARA and upheld the injunction against their enforcement nationwide. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the validity of the regulations and the standing of the environmental groups challenging them. The case involves challenges to Forest Service regulations under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 215.4(a) and \u00a7 215.12(f) after a timber sale was withdrawn. The Ninth Circuit upheld a nationwide injunction against the regulations, with potential implications for environmental groups seeking program-wide reform. The Supreme Court has yet to decide on the case. The Clean Water Act requires the best technology available to minimize environmental impact on water intake structures at power plants. The EPA rule in question allowed cost-benefit analysis, but the Second Circuit ruled it invalid under the Act. The Second Circuit ruled that the Clean Water Act does not allow cost-benefit analysis for determining the best technology available to minimize environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if EPA can compare costs with benefits in this decision. The opposition to using cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws is being tested in a Supreme Court case involving the revival of a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. The case may impact the acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in the Clean Water Act and federal pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation and cost considerations are also under scrutiny in this case. The company plans to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater by piping it to a nearby lake, killing aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, but conflicting regulations apply to the proposed discharge. The EPA issued a \"404 permit\" for Coeur Alaska's ore processing mill, but a new source performance standard under CWA section 306 prohibits discharges into US waters. The court ruled that the performance standard must be incorporated into the mill's NPDES permit, and the Corps should not have issued the 404 permit. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address this issue. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the issue of reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to the EPA under CWA sections 404 and 402. The case involves cleanup costs under CERCLA for a contaminated site in California. The EPA and state sued the company, railroads, and Shell for hazardous substance disposal at a site. The district court found the railroads and Shell liable for a percentage of cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed liability for cleanup costs and apportionment of harm. The court found that neither the railroads nor Shell provided a reasonable basis for apportionment of responsibility for toxic substance disposal. Shell was held liable as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA for arranging a transaction that involved disposal of hazardous substances. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA, focusing on liability for \"arranging\" disposal of hazardous substances and joint and several liability for potentially responsible parties. This case raises fundamental Superfund Act issues and is considered one of the most important Superfund cases to reach the Court. The Superfund statute imposes joint and several liability on responsible parties for cleanup costs, with the Supreme Court's decision in Burlington Northern potentially impacting the government's ability to recover costs. A lax standard for apportioning liability could increase the burden on the federal treasury, while a tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability may limit potential defendants, leading to increased government costs for cleanup. The Supreme Court's decision in Burlington Northern could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs under the Superfund statute. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products, not just arranging for disposal. The environmental community is apprehensive about the direction the Roberts Court may take, as they have won in all five cases below. The split decisions in major environmental cases suggest a different outcome in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's recent decisions in environmental cases have raised concerns among both industry and the environmental community. The Court's trend of siding against environmental interests, particularly in NEPA cases, is notable. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to various factors, including the Court's composition and potential future appointments. The Supreme Court practitioners are showing more interest in environmental cases, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. Despite rejecting difficult cases multiple times, such as those involving the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, the Court's reasons for nonacceptance remain speculative. The Court's trend of siding against environmental interests, particularly in NEPA cases, has raised concerns in both industry and the environmental community. The Supreme Court's trend of rejecting environmental cases has raised concerns in both industry and the environmental community. The justices' lack of a clear majority rationale in the 2006 Rapanos case has left lower courts confused about the rule of law. If a post-Rapanos case were accepted now, a similar outcome is likely."
