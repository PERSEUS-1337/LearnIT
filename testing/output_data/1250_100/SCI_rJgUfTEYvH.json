Recent works have explored probabilistic models, but they are computationally expensive or do not optimize data likelihood directly. This work introduces multi-frame video prediction with normalizing flows, enabling direct optimization of data likelihood and high-quality stochastic predictions. Flow-based generative models show promise in modeling video dynamics. Machine learning has advanced significantly, leading to improvements in image classification, machine translation, and game-playing agents. While current applications rely on supervised learning with large datasets or accurate simulations, there is interest in using unlabeled data with generative models for prediction. These models aim to understand complex real-world phenomena, like physical interactions in videos, to build a rich understanding of the world. Generative models offer a way to understand real-world interactions in videos without labeled examples. By training on large unlabeled datasets, these models can learn about various real-world phenomena. This approach can be useful for downstream tasks or applications like robotics, where predicting the future is crucial for decision-making. The challenge lies in the uncertainty of the future, with many possible outcomes from a short sequence of present observations. This paper focuses on stochastic prediction, specifically conditional video prediction. The paper focuses on conditional video prediction using flow-based generative models to accurately synthesize realistic video frames. It introduces a new class of models that can generate diverse stochastic futures and provide exact likelihoods. The approach involves learning a latent dynamical system model to predict future values, addressing the challenges of modeling high-dimensional video sequences. VideoFlow is a flow-based video prediction model inspired by the Glow model for image generation. It achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction on the BAIR dataset, with fast test-time image synthesis for real-time applications like robotic control. VideoFlow optimizes the likelihood of training videos directly, avoiding the need for a variational lower bound. The research on prediction of future video frames has focused on deterministic models with architectural changes and different generation objectives. The next challenge is to address stochastic environments by building models that can reason over uncertain futures in real-world videos. In stochastic environments, deterministic models struggle to predict uncertain futures in real-world videos. To overcome this challenge, various methods incorporate stochasticity through variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive models. Among these, variational autoencoders have been widely explored, while auto-regressive models directly maximize the log-likelihood of the data by generating videos pixel by pixel. The text discusses the limitations of sequential synthesis models in generating videos pixel by pixel and introduces a proposed VAE model that produces better predictions. The model exhibits faster sampling, optimizes log-likelihood, and generates high-quality long-term predictions using a multi-scale architecture with stochastic variables. The proposed VAE model for video generation utilizes latent variable inference, exact log-likelihood evaluation, and parallel sampling. It employs a flow-based generative approach with invertible transformations to compute log-likelihood accurately. The model breaks down the latent space into separate variables per timestep and generates video frames using a multi-scale flow architecture. The VAE model for video generation uses invertible transformations like Actnorm and Coupling to compute log-likelihood accurately. Coupling splits input y into y1 and y2, then computes z2 using deep networks f and g. The VAE model for video generation utilizes deep networks f and g to compute z2 from y1 in an invertible manner. The architecture includes SoftPermute, Squeeze, and Split operations to infer latent variables at multiple levels for each frame of the video. The VAE model for video generation uses an autoregressive factorization for the latent prior p \u03b8 (z). The conditional prior p \u03b8 (z t |z <t ) is factorized based on previous timesteps and levels. A deep 3-D residual network is used to predict the mean and log-scale of a conditionally factorized Gaussian density. The log-likelihood objective involves an invertible multi-scale architecture and a latent dynamics model. The parameters of the architecture and latent are jointly learned. The autoregressive latent prior p \u03b8 (z) is used in the VAE model for video generation. The flow g \u03b8 acts on separate video frames, while the prior models temporal dependencies. Experimental comparisons show realism in generated trajectories. 3-D convolutional flows were considered but found computationally expensive compared to autoregressive priors. Memory limits restricted the number of sequential frames per gradient step during training. Using 2-D convolutions in our flow f \u03b8 with autoregressive priors allows for synthesizing long sequences without temporal artifacts. Videos generated show a blue border for conditioning frames and a red border for generated frames. VideoFlow models the Stochastic Movement Dataset, where shapes move in eight directions with constant speed. By extracting random temporal patches of 2 frames, VideoFlow maximizes video generation. VideoFlow uses random temporal patches of 2 frames to maximize loglikelihood. It achieves a low 0.04 bits-per-pixel on the holdout set and accurately predicts the future trajectory of shapes. Comparing with SV2P and SAVP-VAE models, VideoFlow outperforms in generating realistic trajectories. The model is evaluated using a real vs fake test on Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing higher fooling rates. The dataset used is the action-free version of the BAIR robot pushing dataset with 64x64 resolution videos. VideoFlow uses random temporal patches of 4 frames to maximize log-likelihood for video generation. It outperforms SAVP-VAE and SV2P models in bits-per-pixel on the test set. Realism and diversity are measured using a 2AFC test and mean pairwise cosine distance in VGG perceptual space. VideoFlow outperforms SAVP-VAE and SV2P models in bits-per-pixel on the test set. The high values of bits-per-pixel in the baselines are attributed to their optimization objective. Different metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics are used to evaluate the generated videos. The BAIR robot-pushing dataset is stochastic, leading to a high number of plausible futures. Various metrics proposed in prior work are followed to evaluate the model's accuracy. In prior work, different metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics are used to evaluate the generated videos. The evaluation involves generating videos from conditioning frames and comparing them to ground truth using various metrics. Pixel-level noise can be removed in the VideoFlow model to improve video quality at the expense of diversity. Sampling videos at a lower temperature can help achieve this. The text discusses the use of temperature scaling in video generation models to improve performance on VGG similarity metrics. Results show that applying low-temperature sampling to latent gaussian priors can negatively impact performance. The optimal temperature model performs comparably to state-of-the-art models on VGG-based similarity metrics. The study compares the performance of VAE models and VideoFlow in terms of diversity and quality of generated videos. VideoFlow outperforms in diversity and realism, with higher fooling rates at lower temperatures. The generated videos show clearer and more realistic motion at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, the motion of the arm becomes more stochastic, leading to a drop in realism. Interpolations between different shapes and sizes show cohesive motion in the BAIR robot pushing dataset. The multi-level latent representation allows for interpolating background objects at smaller scales and arm motion separately. During training, shapes of different sizes and colors are encoded into the latent space, with smooth interpolation of shape sizes observed. Colors are sampled from a uniform distribution, and all interpolated colors are within the training set. VideoFlow is used to generate future frames, showing temporal consistency even with occlusions present. The model maintains a bijection between latent and observed states. The VideoFlow model can forget objects if they are occluded for a few frames due to the Markovian assumption in latent dynamics. Future work aims to address this by incorporating longer memory in the model. The trained VideoFlow model is used to detect the plausibility of a temporally inconsistent frame occurring in the immediate future by conditioning on the first three frames of a test-set video. The likelihood of a frame occurring as the 4th time-step is computed and the model assigns a monotonically decreasing log-likelihood to frames. Our model, VideoFlow, utilizes a latent dynamical system to predict future values and achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction. It optimizes log-likelihood directly for faster synthesis compared to pixel-level autoregressive models, making it practical for various tasks. Future work includes incorporating memory for long-range dependencies and applying the model to challenging tasks.

Adding uniform noise to the data prevents infinite densities, allowing for better optimization. Lowering temperature in latent gaussian priors of VAE models decreases performance, impacting noise removal and stochasticity tradeoff.
