    "content": "Section 3092 of Title 50, U.S. Code mandates that the congressional intelligence committees must be kept informed of all intelligence activities, excluding covert actions, by the Director of National Intelligence and component organizations. Notifications must be in writing and detail the circumstances and significance. Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 112 outlines that component organizations determine reportable activities, including significant intelligence failures and anticipated activities with risks to national security. The Gang of Four notifications are oral briefings provided to select members of the House and Senate, specifically the chairs and ranking members of the congressional intelligence committees. These notifications are not based in statute but are accepted by committee leadership for sensitive non-covert intelligence activities to reduce the risk of disclosure. Section 3093 of Title 50, U.S. Code outlines how congressional intelligence committees are informed of covert actions, including the use of cyber capabilities. The President can authorize covert actions if they support foreign policy objectives and national security. Written findings must be reported to the committees soon after approval, within 48 hours if immediate action is required. Findings cannot authorize actions that have already occurred or violate laws. The President can authorize covert actions to support foreign policy objectives and national security, as outlined in Title 50, U.S. Code. Findings must be reported to congressional intelligence committees, specifying authorized departments and agencies. Third-party involvement must be disclosed, and any significant changes or failures in covert actions must be communicated to the committees. Access to covert action findings can be limited in extraordinary circumstances. The Gang of Eight, consisting of key congressional leaders, must be notified by the President of relevant findings in a timely manner. This notification procedure is formalized in statute and imposes obligations on the executive branch. In contrast, the Gang of Four notification process is more informal and not based in statute. After 180 days, the President must provide access to the finding to all members of the intelligence committees or explain why access must remain limited. The President must make a determination that vital U.S. interests are at stake to restrict notification to the Gang of Eight, providing written reasons. Gang of Four notifications are for non-covert intelligence activities, while Gang of Eight notifications are for covert actions. There is no statutory restriction on how intelligence committee chairs share information with committee members. The executive branch provides classified information to committee leadership through Gang of Four or Gang of Eight notifications. Critics argue that these restricted notifications hinder effective oversight, while supporters maintain they protect sensitive intelligence activities. Some believe Gang of Four notifications are unlawful as they are not based on statute. Supporters argue that Members receiving restricted briefings can raise concerns directly with the President and congressional leadership to address any issues. They also have legislative remedies available, such as using the appropriations process to withhold funding. The congressional defense committees oversee sensitive Department of Defense activities, which differ from intelligence community activities as they are conducted under military authority. Congress has different notification requirements for DOD activities compared to the intelligence community. The integration of military and intelligence activities presents challenges in determining authority under Title 10 or Title 50. Notification requirements for sensitive military activities can be confused with covert or clandestine intelligence community activities. Traditional military activities are conducted under a U.S. military commander preceding hostilities and can be covert or clandestine. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) involves secret or clandestine military activities to shape the operational environment, often using Special Operations Forces. These activities are exempt from congressional notification requirements for covert action. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) includes secret military activities to shape the operational environment, often involving Special Operations Forces. These activities are exempt from congressional notification requirements for covert action and can include clandestine intelligence collection under Title 10 authority. Routine support to traditional military activities involves logistic support to military operations with acknowledged U.S. involvement, while other-than-routine support includes activities abroad that are not unilateral. Other-than-routine support to traditional military activities involves covert and clandestine activities abroad, including recruitment, training, and assistance to non-U.S. entities to support U.S. military objectives. This support may influence political, economic, or military conditions in other countries and requires congressional notification for covert action. The Defense Clandestine Service, under the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides clandestine support to meet strategic military intelligence priorities. The Secretary of Defense must provide quarterly briefings to congressional committees on deployments and collection activities. The Secretary of Defense is required to provide quarterly briefings to congressional committees on deployments and collection activities of personnel from the Defense Clandestine Service. This includes updates on global activities within each geographic combatant command, legal issues, interagency activities, and cyber capabilities not considered covert actions. Notification requirements for cyber weapons intended for use as a weapon are outlined in Section 130k of Title 10, U.S. Code. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to provide quarterly briefings to congressional committees on offensive and defensive cyberspace operations conducted by the Department of Defense. This includes updates on cyber capabilities developed for use as weapons and unauthorized disclosures of cyber weapon capabilities. The briefings must include information on the command involved and the legal authorities under which the operations took place. Sensitive Military Operations, such as kill or capture operations outside declared theaters of active armed conflict, are also defined in Title 10 U.S. Code. The Secretary of Defense is required to provide written notice to congressional defense committees within 48 hours of sensitive military operations conducted outside declared theaters of active armed conflict. This includes operations targeting specific individuals, self-defense actions, and support to covert actions under Title 50 authority. Quarterly briefings are also mandated on DOD personnel and equipment assigned to these operations, including cyber operations. Sensitive military cyber operations, as defined by Section 130j(c) of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, are intended to cause cyber effects outside of areas where the U.S. Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities. The Secretary of Defense must notify congressional defense committees within 48 hours of such operations, especially after an unauthorized disclosure."
