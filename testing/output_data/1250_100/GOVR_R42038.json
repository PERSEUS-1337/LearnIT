    "content": "Insurance companies are a significant part of the U.S. financial services industry, divided into life/health insurance and property/casualty insurance. In 2011, life/health companies had premiums of $581.4 billion, while property/casualty companies had premiums of $436.0 billion. The industry's total assets were around $7.5 trillion. Different types of insurance have varying risks and characteristics, with life insurance having long-term contracts, property/casualty insurance having shorter contracts with higher catastrophic risk exposure, and health insurance being closely tied to healthcare delivery. Insurance companies in the U.S. are heavily involved in healthcare delivery and regulated by the federal government through various acts. Unlike banks and securities firms, insurance companies have been regulated by states for the past 150 years due to a 1868 U.S. Supreme Court decision. This decision was later challenged in a 1944 case, where federal antitrust laws were found applicable to insurance associations' interstate activities. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 was passed to preserve states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the insurance industry. Despite some exceptions like the Liability Risk Retention Act, proposals to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government have generally been resisted. Efforts to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government have been opposed by states and the insurance industry. Regulatory reform efforts at the state level and by groups like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners aimed to improve state regulation and prevent federal involvement. In the mid-1980s, there was a push to transfer regulatory authority to the federal government due to insolvencies in large insurance companies, with concerns raised about the effectiveness of state regulation. Former House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell held hearings on state regulatory structure and proposed legislation for federal oversight. In the late 1990s, a breach in the state regulatory system occurred when Martin Frankel diverted over $200 million from small life insurance companies into overseas accounts, despite reforms implemented at the state level and by the NAIC. This incident did not lead to long-term changes in federal involvement in insurance regulation. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, state insurance guaranty funds were introduced to protect insurance consumers in case of insolvency. These funds function similarly to the FDIC for banks, providing coverage up to certain limits for property/casualty insurance and life insurance benefits. Insurers in the state are assessed to make up any shortfalls in the guaranty fund payments. The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) reformed the financial regulatory system in the United States, driven by market forces leading to convergence in financial services. GLBA removed barriers between banks, securities firms, and insurance companies, allowing for competition and the delivery of financial products more efficiently. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) removed barriers between banks, securities firms, and insurance companies, creating a new competitive paradigm. It reaffirmed state insurance regulators as the primary regulators of insurance products. Some insurance companies feel state regulation puts them at a disadvantage compared to federally regulated non-insurer competitors. This is due to perceived inefficiencies in state regulation, such as delays in product approval and market entry. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) led to industry support for optional federal charter for insurance and modernization of state laws. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) was proposed but never implemented due to state legislation enactment. The issue of insurance producer licensing reciprocity or uniformity persisted post-GLBA. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to enhance competition among financial services providers, but the expected convergence of banks, securities firms, and insurers did not occur as anticipated. Despite the major merger between Citibank and Travelers that spurred the passage of GLBA, Citigroup has divested most of its insurance subsidiaries. Instead of cross-sector mergers, banks began distributing insurance and insurers created financing-like products. Consolidation continued within each sector. In the aftermath of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, consolidation persisted within the financial sectors as banks merged with banks and insurers with insurers. Congressional interest in insurance regulatory issues remained high, with the House Financial Services Committee holding numerous hearings on the matter. Various proposals for federal intervention in insurance regulation were introduced but not advanced. Additionally, narrower bills addressing specific aspects of insurance regulation were also put forward in Congress. The financial crisis of 2007 led to panic with the conservatorship of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the failure of Lehman Brothers. Calls for regulatory reforms increased due to failures in oversight and coordination, leading to debates on systemic risk regulation and federal oversight of larger insurance firms. Insurers performed well during the crisis, supporting arguments to retain the state-based insurance system. During the financial crisis of 2007, the insurance industry saw notable failures, including the collapse of bond insurers due to exposure to mortgage-backed securities and the specific failure of American International Group (AIG). These events caused disruptions in the municipal bond markets and highlighted the need for regulatory reforms and federal oversight of larger insurance firms. During the financial crisis of 2007, the insurance industry faced failures, including AIG's near collapse in September 2008. AIG sought over $100 billion in assistance from the Federal Reserve, resulting in the U.S. government owning 92% of the company. The rescue involved multiple restructurings, with the Federal Reserve assistance repaid and the U.S. Treasury selling most of its equity stake. The incidents raised concerns about regulatory failures and the need for increased federal involvement in insurance oversight. AIG, a complex entity, faced failure during the 2007 financial crisis. The losses stemmed from derivatives and securities lending operations overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). The Federal Reserve argued for centralized oversight of systemic risk, leading to the absorption of OTS into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Dodd-Frank Act enacted broad financial regulatory reform in response to the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act provisions addressed insurance by creating a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to oversee systemically important insurers. It also harmonized tax and regulatory treatment for surplus lines insurance and reinsurance. Holding company oversight may impact insurers with banking subsidiaries. Current insurance issues before Congress include oversight of Dodd-Frank Act implementation and legislation for regulatory reform. Recent insurance legislation not introduced in the 112th Congress includes bills for a federal insurance charter and regulatory system (H.R. 1880) and to modify the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust exemption (H.R. 1583). The House Committee on Financial Services' Subcommittee on Insurance has held hearings on various topics related to insurance oversight. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has also been involved in insurance-related discussions. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury to monitor and coordinate policy related to international agreements in the insurance industry. FIO has limited preemption authority over state laws that conflict with international agreements, focusing on non-U.S. insurers' treatment and consumer protection levels. This authority does not extend to state measures on rates, premiums, underwriting, or sales practices. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor and coordinate international insurance policy. FIO has limited preemption authority over state laws conflicting with international agreements, focusing on non-U.S. insurers and consumer protection. The office's monitoring function includes gathering information from public and private sources, with subpoena power if necessary. Director Michael McRaith leads FIO, actively participating in international discussions. The process of establishing FIO took longer than expected, with McRaith appointed in June 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to oversee international insurance policy. Director Michael McRaith took up the position in June 2011, a year after the enactment of Dodd-Frank. Reports on insurance regulation modernization and reinsurance required by Dodd-Frank are pending. The Act includes systemic-risk provisions affecting the insurance industry through Federal Reserve oversight and prudential standards for banks with over $50 billion in assets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designates systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and sets higher prudential standards. The FSOC aims to identify risks to financial stability and promote market discipline. The Federal Reserve sets prudential standards for financial firms based on risk factors, including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management, and exposure limits. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. The Federal Reserve conducts annual stress tests on systemically significant firms and issues regulations to prevent insolvency. Higher prudential standards have been proposed but not finalized. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has proposed higher prudential standards for financial firms, but the rule has not been finalized. It is uncertain if a separate rule for non-bank institutions will be issued or if one rule will apply to all Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs). A financial company could be subject to a special resolution regime under the Dodd-Frank Act if its failure would cause systemic disruption. Insurance subsidiaries of such financial companies would not be subject to this regime and would be resolved under state insurance resolution systems. The FDIC would have backup authority to resolve insurers if the state system does not act within 60 days. Funding for the resolution of systemically important financial firms would come from assessments imposed by the FDIC on financial companies with over $50 billion in assets and other firms overseen by the Federal Reserve on a risk-adjusted basis. The FDIC is to impose assessments on financial firms on a risk-adjusted basis, taking into account insurers' contributions to state insurance resolution regimes. H.R. 6423 has been introduced in Congress to remove insurers from resolution authority. FSOC has issued rules for nonbank financial companies deemed systemically important, with insurers arguing they do not pose systemic risk due to specific aspects of their operations. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated oversight of thrift holding companies and bank holding companies under the Federal Reserve, strengthening capital standards. The Federal Reserve is also implementing higher capital standards for banks under Basel III. 27 bank or thrift holding companies overseen by the Federal Reserve are largely engaged in the business of insurance, including AIG, Nationwide, and State Farm. The thrift subsidiary operations of 27 holding companies are relatively small compared to their insurance operations, with combined banking/thrift assets totaling $124.3 billion. USAA is an exception with thrift assets nearly as large as its insurance assets. The Volcker Rule under Dodd-Frank could impact insurers with banking subsidiaries by restricting proprietary trading, but there are exemptions for regulated insurance companies. The FSOC released a study on the Volcker Rule required by Dodd-Frank, recommending careful monitoring of fund flows between banking entities and insurance companies. Insurers have concerns about capital rules proposed by the Federal Reserve, leading some to sell their banking subsidiaries to avoid oversight. Bernanke acknowledged the need for regulation that considers the unique characteristics of insurance companies. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III rules are being applied by MetLife, the largest firm to do so. Title V, Subtitle B of Dodd-Frank focuses on insurance regulatory issues, harmonizing regulation and taxation of nonadmitted insurance. The act gives the \"home state\" of the insured sole authority to regulate and collect taxes on surplus lines transactions, preempting conflicting state laws unless alternative uniform requirements are met. The agreement on taxes and streamlined federal standards allow commercial purchasers to access surplus lines insurance. For reinsurance transactions, the home state of the insurer has authority over the transaction, while the home state of the reinsurer regulates the reinsurer's solvency. NAIC and NCOIL developed interstate agreements that differ in authority ceded by states. NCOIL's SLIMPACT addresses surplus lines regulatory issues and taxes, while NAIC's NIMA focuses on tax allocation. Lack of uniformity was discussed in congressional hearings, with plans to blend the two approaches. NCOIL aims to address uniformity issues by blending approaches before the House Financial Services Committee. H.R. 1112, introduced by Rep. Randy Neugebauer, proposes establishing NARAB for insurance producers to operate across states. NARAB would be overseen by a board with industry and state appointees. The NARAB board consists of five appointees from the insurance industry and four from state insurance commissioners, appointed by the President. NARAB, established under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, aims to streamline state insurance producer licensing. H.R. 2126, introduced in 2011, seeks to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws. The bill, H.R. 2126, aims to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws by allowing risk retention groups (RRGs) to cover commercial property risks and risk purchasing groups (RPGs) to purchase coverage for commercial property risks. It also proposes changes to the enforcement mechanism for federal preemptions in the Liability Risk Retention Act (LRRA) and adds federal corporate governance, disclosure, and fiduciary duty requirements for RRGs. The director of the Federal Insurance Office would issue determinations on state regulations of RRGs and RPGs, as well as study and report to Congress on compliance with the LRRA. The bill H.R. 3559 introduced by Representative Steve Stivers on December 5, 2011, aims to impose governance standards on risk retention groups (RRGs) by requiring independent directors on the board, an audit committee of independent directors, and limited contracts with service providers. It also includes amendments to expand consumer disclosure and impose a fiduciary duty on RRGs. The bill would remove the Federal Insurance Office's authority to issue subpoenas and extend confidentiality requirements for insurance information gathered by the office. H.R. 6423, introduced by Representative Bill Posey and Representative Judy Biggert, aims to amend Dodd-Frank by exempting insurance companies from the resolution regime. It would remove the FDIC's authority to resolve insurance subsidiaries and exclude insurance companies from the FDIC's assessment authority. The bill has not had direct hearings but was discussed in a subcommittee hearing in November 2011. The United States generally has a surplus in trade in financial services, except for insurance services where it consistently runs a deficit. Consolidations in the insurance industry are creating larger international entities with growing market shares, particularly in the reinsurance market. The need for a single voice at the federal level to represent U.S. insurance interests on the international stage is a frequently heard argument for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation. The FIO is specifically tasked with developing federal policy in international insurance matters. The European Union (EU) is implementing a comprehensive program to transform the EU into a single market for financial services, including an updated solvency regime for insurers known as Solvency II. The European Union is implementing Solvency II legislation to overhaul financial soundness in insurers, creating a new regulatory authority, EIOPA. Delays in implementation have raised concerns about potential discrimination against U.S. insurers. EIOPA has recommended equivalence for Switzerland, Bermuda, and Japan. EIOPA has recommended equivalence for Switzerland, Bermuda, and Japan but not for the United States. The EU sees the complexity of the U.S. regulatory system as a barrier for overseas companies. Access to the U.S. market for insurance is a significant issue for EU insurers due to state regulatory requirements perspectives on collateral requirements for non-U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC has proposed changes to reduce collateral requirements for reinsurers based on their financial strength. These changes need to be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators. 11 states, representing 40% of US insurance premiums, have already revised their statutes or regulations regarding reinsurance collateral reduction, with only Florida and New York approving any reinsurers for collateral. Following the passage of GLBA, state insurance regulators through the NAIC embarked on a regulatory modernization program to meet the realities of the new financial services marketplace. Efforts included addressing issues such as state privacy protections, reciprocity of state producer licensing laws, and promotion of \"speed to market\" for new insurance products. Certification of 47 states as reciprocal jurisdictions for producer licensing laws exceeded GLBA requirements. The NAIC has adopted heightened standards for reciprocity with 37 states, exceeding GLBA requirements. The System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) saw significant growth with over 558,000 filings in 2011. Forty-nine states participate in SERFF with an average turnaround time of 47 days for life/health filings and 28 days for property/casualty filings. Additionally, 41 states have joined the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact, aiming to provide regulatory uniformity for certain insurance lines. The NAIC supports state-based insurance regulation over federal government involvement, citing better protection for consumer interests. In 2010, state insurance departments had a budget of $1.3 billion, handling over 304,000 consumer complaints and 2.1 million inquiries. The NAIC also backed federal efforts to address systemic risk while maintaining state regulation. The NAIC made changes to strengthen oversight of insurance holding companies and securities lending, reducing reliance on credit rating agencies. The \"Solvency Modernization Initiative\" was launched to consider international developments in insurance supervision. In 2008, the Treasury released a Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, aiming for a more flexible and efficient regulatory framework. The 2008 Treasury blueprint proposed a revamped regulatory structure for financial services, including a prudential regulator, business conduct regulator, and market stability regulator. It recommended creating a federal insurance regulator for an optional federal charter and federal licensing for agents. President Obama's Financial Regulatory Reform Plan in 2009 also addressed insurance oversight. The Treasury Department, under Secretary Timothy Geithner, released a whitepaper outlining President Obama's plan for financial regulatory reform in the United States. The plan included introducing systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve, merging the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, and establishing a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Insurance regulation was not a primary focus of the plan, with most insurance products excluded from the jurisdiction of the new agency. States were to maintain a significant role in insurance regulation, while specific changes to insurance regulation were addressed through other aspects of the plan. The President's plan for financial regulatory reform included systemic risk regulation by the Federal Reserve and the creation of a new Office of National Insurance within the Treasury. Companies engaging in financial activities could be designated as Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies subject to stringent solvency standards and enhanced resolution authority. State regulatory agencies were also mentioned in the draft legislation. The draft legislation mentioned state regulatory agencies but left open how the Federal Reserve would interact with state regulators of insurance subsidiaries. The creation of an Office of National Insurance under President Obama's plan would oversee federal insurance policy, represent the US in international matters, and preempt some state laws inconsistent with international agreements. Several pieces of legislation addressing insurance regulation were introduced in the 111th Congress, including the Insurance Industry Competition Act of 2009 (H.R. 1583) and the National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 1880). H.R. 1583 aimed to abolish the exemption from federal antitrust laws for the \"business of insurance\" and remove a prohibition on investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, while H.R. 1880 focused on consumer protection. H.R. 1880, introduced by Edward Royce in 2009, aimed to create a federal charter for the insurance industry. It would have established a federal insurance regulatory entity under the Department of the Treasury, preempting most state insurance laws for nationally regulated entities. The bill also addressed systemic risk by designating a systemic risk regulator for insurance. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 2554) aimed to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a private, nonprofit corporation. NARAB members would be able to operate in any state after obtaining a license in one state, subject to state regulations and market conduct rules. The bill passed the House in 2011 but was not acted upon by the Senate. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws, allowing risk retention groups to cover commercial property risks. It also proposed changes to enforcement mechanisms and added federal corporate governance requirements for risk retention groups. The bill was introduced by Representative Dennis Moore but was not further acted upon. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups. It proposed adding federal corporate governance requirements, including independent directors, governance standards, and fiduciary duties. The bill also sought to enhance consumer disclosure and limit contracts with service providers. The Federal License for Reinsurers Act of 2010 (H.R. 6529) was introduced by Representative Dennis Moore but did not progress in the House Committee on Financial Services. The bill aimed to create a federal license for reinsurers under the authority of the FIO, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, allowing for preemption of state laws deemed inconsistent with federal law."
