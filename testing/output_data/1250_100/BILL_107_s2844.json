    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children (I Teach) Act of 2002\". Congress makes findings regarding the need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade, challenges in recruiting qualified teachers in rural and high-poverty schools, the importance of rural education, and the need for special support in high-poverty schools to meet education goals. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, founded in 1987, sets high standards for accomplished teachers. Over 16,000 teachers nationwide have completed certification, showing better performance compared to non-certified peers. Teacher salaries have remained stagnant over the past decade. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards sets high standards for teachers. The Act aims to encourage teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through tax credits and provide additional credits for National Board certification to recruit and retain qualified teachers in public schools. The Act offers tax credits to incentivize teachers to work in high-poverty or rural schools and provides additional credits for National Board certification to attract and retain qualified teachers in public schools. Tax credits are provided to eligible teachers working in high-poverty or rural schools, with an applicable amount of $1,000 for those in public schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. The National School Lunch Act establishes a lunch program for schools with a School Locale Code of 7 or 8. Certified teachers can receive $1,000 or $2,000 if they are certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and work in rural areas or high-poverty schools.
