    "title": "AB 815",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Board of Equalization amends Section 8670.40 of the Government Code to collect a fee for oil spill prevention and administration, not exceeding $0.065 per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is imposed on owners of crude oil or petroleum products received at marine terminals or refineries in the state, collected per barrel by the terminal operator or refinery. The rebuttable presumption applies to crude oil or petroleum products received at marine terminals or refineries, which can be overcome by showing evidence that they did not pass over, across, under, or through state waters. The State Board of Equalization has limitations on petition for redetermination and claim for refund under the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law. The State Board of Equalization will accept petitions for redetermination or claims for refund of fees based on whether crude oil or petroleum products passed over, across, under, or through state waters. The fees for oil spill prevention must be remitted to the State Board of Equalization by refinery or marine terminal operators on the 25th day of the month based on the volume of crude oil or petroleum products received. The fee will not be collected if it has already been paid at another facility, and operators can presume the fee has been previously collected for petroleum products derived from in-state crude oil. The owner of crude oil or petroleum products is liable for a fee until paid to the State Board of Equalization, except if paid to a registered refinery or marine terminal operator. The administrator annually prepares a plan projecting revenues and expenses over three fiscal years, setting the fee to match expenses, with a possible surplus for contingencies. The adjusted fee rate is rounded to four decimal places and effective after 30 days notification. The moneys collected from the fee described in this section shall be deposited into a fund. The State Board of Equalization will collect the fee and adopt regulations for its implementation. The fee will be used for oil spill prevention programs, research, environmental and economic studies, emergency response programs, and to fund the Oiled Wildlife Care Network. The funds deposited in the fund cannot be used for responding to a spill. The moneys collected from the fee will be deposited into a fund and used for various programs, but not for responding to spills or providing loans. Amendments to the section will become operative on September 18, 2014. Additionally, definitions for \"barrel\" and registration requirements for operating refineries, marine terminals, and pipelines are outlined in the Revenue and Taxation Code. The Legislature intends for the State Board of Equalization to collect the oil spill prevention fee only upon first delivery to a refinery or marine terminal, not on subsequent movements of the same crude oil or petroleum products."
