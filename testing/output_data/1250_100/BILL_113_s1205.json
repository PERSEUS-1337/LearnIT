    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy is wasted in the United States, with a portion of it being released as waste heat from power plants and other facilities. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity. Additionally, renewable energy resources can be utilized to meet local energy needs, which can enhance the reliability and resiliency of energy supplies in the country. District energy systems in the United States utilize waste heat and renewable energy resources to enhance industrial competitiveness, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, increase energy supply resiliency, and keep energy dollars in local economies. These systems also support the expansion of combined heat and power (CHP) systems by providing infrastructure for delivering thermal energy to end users like colleges and universities. District energy systems serve various users such as colleges, hospitals, and downtown areas, helping to reduce peak power demand and transmission constraints. Evaluation and implementation of these systems involve technical, economic, and institutional challenges, often requiring technical assistance. A major barrier to utilizing waste heat and renewable energy resources is the lack of long-term capital funding. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms related to energy systems, including combined heat and power system, district energy system, Loan Guarantee Program, and local energy infrastructure. These definitions aim to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to enhance energy supply resiliency and reduce air pollution. The Act defines terms related to energy systems, including combined heat and power system, district energy system, microgrid, and renewable energy resources. These definitions aim to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to enhance energy supply resiliency and reduce air pollution. The Act defines various terms related to energy systems and renewable energy resources, including biomass, gaseous or liquid fuels, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, solar energy, and renewable thermal energy. Renewable thermal energy refers to heating or cooling energy derived from renewable sources, natural cooling sources, or other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. \"Thermal energy\" includes heating energy for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, and cooling energy for air conditioning or process cooling. \"Waste energy\" is energy contained in exhaust gases, hot liquids, or pressure drops in gas systems. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. \"Waste energy\" includes energy in exhaust gases, hot liquids, or pressure drops in gas systems. Waste energy excludes pressure drops to a condenser venting heat, condenser water from chilled water or refrigeration plants, or any other form of waste energy as determined by the Secretary. Waste energy in existing facilities not being used or in new facilities not conventionally used in comparable systems. The Technical Assistance Program is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. Assistance may include identifying energy opportunities, assessing characteristics, utility interconnection, contract negotiation, permitting, marketing, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. The program established by the Secretary provides technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. Eligible entities, both nonprofit and for-profit, can receive grants to cover costs such as initial assessments, feasibility studies, and guidance on overcoming barriers to implementation. The dissemination of information includes case studies and computer software for local energy infrastructure. The program provides technical assistance for local energy infrastructure projects, with a focus on eliminating fossil fuel use and enhancing energy supply reliability. Eligible entities must submit applications for competitive grants, prioritizing projects with the greatest potential impact. The program aims to address the impact of extreme weather events, power grid failures, and fossil fuel supply interruptions. It also focuses on minimizing environmental impact, promoting renewable energy resources, enhancing industrial competitiveness, and creating local job opportunities. The Secretary is required to establish rules and procedures for program administration within 180 days of the Act's enactment. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to support the program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII. The program focuses on addressing extreme weather events, power grid failures, and promoting renewable energy resources. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to support the program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII. The program reserves $4 billion for loan guarantees for commercial or innovative projects related to local energy infrastructure. The Secretary is directed to use unobligated funds from section 1703 for these guarantees. SEC. 6. DEFINITION OF INVESTMENT AREA. Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to include local energy infrastructure as a potential investment area."
