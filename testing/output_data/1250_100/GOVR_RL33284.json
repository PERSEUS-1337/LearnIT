    "content": "The federal government has long supported minority and socially disadvantaged small businesses through procurement contracts and assistance programs. These programs, originating from the Small Business Act of 1958, aim to help disadvantaged businesses become competitive by providing various forms of support such as management assistance, training, and preferential treatment in government contracts. The \u00a7 8(a) program, initially focused on job creation, shifted to minority small business development through federal contracting with socially and economically disadvantaged firms. President Nixon's executive orders directed agencies to promote minority business enterprise, leading to the statutory basis for the program in 1978 with P.L. 95-507. This program, known as the \"Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development\" program, allows the SBA to enter into various contracts with federal agencies. The Small Business Administration (SBA) can enter into construction, supply, and service contracts with federal departments. They act as prime contractors and subcontract to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Applicants for \u00a7 8(a) certification must show social disadvantage or prejudice due to their group identity. The SBA presumes certain groups are socially disadvantaged, while others must prove individual social disadvantage. Economic disadvantage must also be demonstrated to qualify for \u00a7 8(a) certification. The Small Business Administration (SBA) allows for disadvantaged individuals to participate in federal contracts through programs like the \u00a7 8(a) certification. This certification is not limited to racial minorities but also includes those facing ethnic prejudice or cultural bias. The Minority Small Business Subcontracting Program under \u00a7 8(d) of the Small Business Act enforces goals for utilizing small socially and economically disadvantaged firms in federal contracts. The government enforces goals for utilizing small socially and economically disadvantaged firms in federal contracts. Contractors must agree to an acceptable plan for disadvantaged individuals, including various minority groups. Failure to comply may result in liquidated damages. Federal agencies must establish annual percentage goals for awarding contracts to small disadvantaged businesses. Congress set government-wide procurement goals for small and disadvantaged businesses to promote opportunities. The government enforces goals for utilizing small socially and economically disadvantaged firms in federal contracts, with contractors required to adopt compatible goals. The goals may be waived in certain circumstances. Amendments in 1994 expanded procurement goals to include small businesses owned by women. Statutory set-asides and preferences for disadvantaged firms have been common in federal funding measures for education, defense, and transportation. Congress established goals for small disadvantaged businesses in procurement for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard. Various acts included a 10% minority business participation goal. Agencies were authorized to apply a price preference to meet these goals. Recent litigation deemed DOD's SDB program unconstitutional. The Adarand case involved constitutional issues regarding federal affirmative action programs, with the Supreme Court repeatedly avoiding a decision on the merits. Lower court decisions and regulatory reforms significantly altered the legal and factual framework of the case. Despite multiple appeals and changes in the plaintiff's legal standing, the Court ultimately dismissed the appeal in 2001 without addressing the constitutional issues. The Tenth Circuit's ruling invalidated a federal highway program promoting minority and disadvantaged small business utilization, but a revised program in 1997 was found to be narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. The Adarand case involved constitutional issues regarding federal affirmative action programs. Prior to Adarand, the U.S. Supreme Court had approved congressionally mandated racial preferences in certain cases. However, the Court generally condemned similar actions taken by state and local entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs. The disputes raised questions about whether state affirmative action measures for racial minorities were subject to strict scrutiny or a more lenient standard. In Croson, the Court ruled that race-conscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination, but racial balancing without specific evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible. The Adarand case established that all racial classifications by government must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored. The case originated from a race-conscious subcontracting compensation program conducted by the Federal Highway Administration. The Adarand case challenged a subcontracting compensation program that provided incentive payments to prime contractors working with disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs). The program was initially upheld by lower courts using lenient judicial review, but the Supreme Court later ruled that all racial classifications by the government must be justified by a compelling interest and narrowly tailored. In Adarand I, the Supreme Court rejected the equal protection approach and applied strict scrutiny to racial classifications by Congress. The Court acknowledged the need for remedies for past discrimination but required that any racial preference be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. This decision undermined previous judicial leniency towards Congress in crafting affirmative action measures for minorities. The Supreme Court in Adarand II allowed for some racial preference by Congress in certain cases, but did not provide clear guidance on the extent of congressional authority. The court remanded the case back to lower courts for further review. The district court determined that Congress could enact broad discrimination remedies based on nationwide findings, but the DOT incentive program failed the \"narrow tailoring\" test. The Tenth Circuit in 2000 reversed the district court injunction against the DOT's disadvantaged business enterprise program in Colorado, finding that the program's racial incentives were overinclusive and underinclusive. The court considered the constitutionality of the program and agreed that the financial incentives were not narrowly tailored. The SCC system of financial incentives, in effect during Adarand I, was found to be not narrowly tailored to meet strict scrutiny requirements. After congressional hearings, the incentives were eliminated, and reforms were made to DBE requirements for state and local highway aid recipients. The appeals court determined that the DOT's disadvantaged business enterprise program, as currently structured, passed constitutional muster. Congress was found to have a compelling interest in addressing past discrimination in government contracting on a nationwide scale, with admissible evidence including post-enactment evidence and legislative history. The court found evidence of public and private discrimination in the construction industry, supported by congressional hearings and disparity studies. This evidence satisfied the Tenth Circuit panel that Congress had a strong basis for addressing discriminatory barriers in federal contracting. The appellate tribunal reviewed the DBE program, finding that constitutional flaws had been eliminated by government reforms. The court reversed the district court's order, allowing implementation of the revised program. It clarified that the 5% and 10% goals in the program were aspirational, not mandatory. The revised DBE program addressed constitutional flaws by requiring recipients to exhaust race-neutral alternatives before considering race, incorporating time limits and graduation requirements for disadvantaged businesses. The 5% and 10% goals were deemed aspirational, not mandatory. The court of appeals found that the revised DOT program for disadvantaged businesses was more flexible and voluntary for prime contractors, with monetary caps on subsidies and a new standard for proof of \"social disadvantage.\" The program also ensured that any use of \"aspirational goals\" referenced the availability of DBEs in the market to avoid arbitrariness. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in an appeal from the Tenth Circuit's final decision in the Adarand case, focusing more on procedural irregularities than the substance of the constitutional claims. The government argued that Adarand's challenge was limited to the DOT program and regulations for highway construction on federal lands, not the separate regulatory scheme for federal highway assistance to states. Petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc. argued that the Tenth Circuit's analysis of DOT regulations for state and local highway projects was irrelevant to the separate rules for federal procurement, undermining the conclusion that the SDB program was narrowly tailored. The race-conscious aspects of the financial incentive program had been suspended in Colorado and other states, making it difficult for Adarand to argue that they were unable to compete equally. The Tenth Circuit had also rejected Adarand's attack on the statutory framework for federal small disadvantaged business programs. The government contended that Adarand's lawsuit had \"outlived the program that provoked it.\" The Supreme Court dismissed Adarand's lawsuit due to technical flaws in the appeal, as the company challenged a defunct aspect of the program that the Tenth Circuit had not ruled upon. The Court declined to reach the merits of the controversy, leaving unanswered questions about the misapplication of the strict scrutiny standard. The Tenth Circuit found that Congress had a solid basis in evidence for enacting race-conscious legislation to address past discrimination. Court rulings have emphasized the need for congruence and proportionality in remedies for race discrimination under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The implications of this principle for race discrimination legislation remain uncertain. The Tenth Circuit found that Congress had a solid basis in evidence for enacting race-conscious legislation to address past discrimination. Questions remain about the breadth of congressional authority under \u00a7 5 for equal protection violations by states. The Court also considered whether the means chosen by DOT to promote minority participation in federal procurement were \"narrowly tailored,\" with some courts questioning the coercive nature of government-mandated goal-setting and enforcement sanctions. The D.C. Circuit invalidated a California affirmative action statute and blurred the distinction between \"inclusive\" and exclusive \"affirmative\" action. FCC regulations were found to be unlawful as they influenced hiring decisions. The final Adarand appeal postponed a definitive review of federally mandated affirmative action. Cases in lower federal courts are raising questions about Congress's power in this area. The lower federal courts are dealing with cases related to Congress's power to enact racial preferences in federal contracting, similar to issues left unresolved in the Adarand case. The Justice Department proposed reforms in 1996 to narrow federal minority and disadvantaged small business programs, setting stricter requirements for certification and eligibility for minority contractors. The plan included suspending set-aside programs for two years and implementing statistical benchmarks for estimating disadvantaged business participation in federal contracts. Bid and evaluation credits were authorized for economically disadvantaged firms in industries where minority participation fell below the benchmark. The Commerce Department monitors bid and evaluation credits for economically disadvantaged firms and prime contractors who commit to subcontract with them. If minority participation exceeds industry benchmarks, credits may be lowered or suspended. The system, implemented in 1997, relies on outreach and technical assistance to avoid constitutional issues. Contracting officers can use monetary incentives to increase subcontracting opportunities for disadvantaged firms. The program aims to increase subcontracting opportunities for disadvantaged firms through benchmarking by the Commerce Department. It uses census data to determine the capacity of minority-owned firms and calculates the effects of discrimination on their development. The goal is to assess when minority-owned firms can compete equally without race-conscious programs. Utilization of minority-owned firms in specific industries may still require the use of such programs like price or evaluation credits. The SBA implemented new regulations in 1998 for the \u00a7 8(a) business development and small disadvantaged business program. These reforms included a new certification process for small disadvantaged businesses and a price evaluation adjustment program tied to Commerce benchmarks. Previously, firms self-certified for \"disadvantaged\" eligibility, but now SBA or approved agencies make a determination of disadvantaged status based on ownership and control by specified individuals. The definition of social and economic disadvantage remains largely unchanged. The SBA regulation implemented in 1998 includes new certification criteria for small disadvantaged businesses, with a focus on social and economic disadvantage. Non-minority applicants no longer need to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" but must meet a \"preponderance of evidence\" rule. USDOT also revised regulations to implement minority set-aside provisions in federal transportation authorization measures. The Small Business Act requires that not less than 10% of funds for certain programs be spent on small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The law was extended in 2005 and continued through FY2009, with revised regulations defining disadvantaged business enterprises. Owners with over $750,000 in assets are disqualified unless they can prove social and economic disadvantage. White males can qualify for DBE status if they demonstrate actual disadvantage. The regulations for the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program delegate implementation to state agencies receiving federal transportation funds. States must calculate the availability of DBEs locally and adjust for discrimination to determine the portion of funding allocated to DBEs. Race-neutral methods should be used to meet the maximum feasible goal, with race-conscious measures applied when necessary. DBE goals are not required in every contract. The DBE program allows flexibility in setting goals for DBE participation in federally funded transportation contracts. Prime contractors must make good faith efforts to meet these goals by subcontracting work to DBEs. The SBA proposed regulations in 2007 to implement set-asides for industries where women-owned small businesses are underrepresented in federal procurement. The SBA proposed regulations in 2007 to implement set-asides for industries where women-owned small businesses are underrepresented in federal procurement. The agency faced criticism for selecting a restrictive methodology, leading to delays in determining underrepresented industries. The SBA extended the comment period in response to a court decision, but the final regulations did not identify specific industries for set-asides. The new regulations for set-asides for women-owned small businesses require federal agencies to determine if the set-aside is related to remedying sex discrimination in a specific industry. The regulations aim to comply with equal protection standards by establishing evidence of discrimination. In 2010, the Obama Administration proposed regulations to withdraw the previous methodology for identifying underrepresented industries and establish a new method without requiring agency-by-agency discrimination determinations. The SBA does not explicitly address Rothe in its comments on the proposed regulations for set-asides for women-owned small businesses. It states that the means chosen by Congress for the WOSB Program are substantially related to its goals. The SBA suggests that the set-asides for women-owned small businesses would likely survive intermediate scrutiny, with the focus on the disparity studies underlying the determinations of eligible industries. Several lower federal courts have addressed congressional authority to implement affirmative action remedies since Adarand. Courts have generally found a compelling government interest for affirmative action programs, but there is disagreement on whether states must justify racial preferences. The Supreme Court declined to revisit these issues in 2004, upholding the DBE program in Minnesota and Nebraska. State highway departments in these states set goals for awarding contracts to DBEs, with white-owned contractors also submitting bids. In Minnesota and Nebraska, white-owned contractors challenged the award of federally-funded contracts to DBEs, alleging unconstitutional race discrimination. Federal district courts upheld the DBE program, stating that the government has a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination in government contracting markets. The program uses race-based measures that must be narrowly-tailored to further this interest. The petitioners argued that Congress and DOT lacked \"hard evidence\" of intentional discrimination in the contracting industry, relying on a Justice Department summary of documents and hearings. The Eighth Circuit agreed with the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that evidence of race discrimination in federal highway contracting existed. The Minnesota DOT and Nebraska road department were not required to independently prove a compelling government interest. However, a national program must be limited to areas where race-based measures are needed, and state implementation is crucial for strict scrutiny review. Race-conscious methods cannot be used in the current DOT program unless race-neutral means are exhausted. The DOT program requires race-conscious methods to be used only when race-neutral means are insufficient to achieve the goal, with racial preferences limited to cases of egregious discrimination. The program is considered narrowly tailored due to its ties to labor markets, durational limits, and good faith waivers. Minnesota and Nebraska's implementation of the DBE program was found to be narrowly tailored at the state level. The issue in Western States Paving Co., Inc. v. Washington State Department of Transportation is whether TEA-21's allocation of funds for disadvantaged contractors is unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed with other circuits that race and sex preferences for highway contractors under TEA-21 are valid to address discrimination in the transportation construction industry. The regulations prohibit quotas and require states to use race-neutral means to meet goals. The court found the preferences to be narrowly tailored to further federal interests in combating discrimination. The court found that states must make good faith efforts to meet racial goals using race-neutral means. Durational limitations ensure regular evaluation of minority preference programs. The 10% DBE goal is aspirational, with state goals based on local labor market realities. However, the Washington State program was challenged for not being narrowly tailored to address discrimination, as there was no evidence of current or past discrimination in transportation contracts. The court ruled that states must show evidence of discrimination against each minority group in their DBE program. In Rothe Development Corporation v. U.S. Department of Defense, a non-minority woman's business challenged the constitutionality of the DOD's SDB program after losing a contract to a business owned by Korean-Americans. The challenge focused on the 1992 and 2006 reenactments of the statutory authority for the program. The challenged SDB program in Rothe incorporates the SBA definition of small disadvantaged business and establishes a 5% participation goal for such entities in DOD contracts. DOD may apply a price evaluation adjustment of up to 10% to give disadvantaged entrepreneurs a preference. The DOD program was held unconstitutional as applied due to insufficient statistical evidence of discrimination before Congress in 1992. The Federal Circuit reversed the district court's decision on the constitutionality of DOD's SBD program, stating that there was not a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-conscious remedies when the statute was reenacted in 2006. The court found flaws in the disparity studies used to support the program, leading to the program being deemed unconstitutional on its face. The Federal Circuit found flaws in disparity studies used to support the SDB program, deeming them insufficient as a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-conscious remedies. The studies were criticized for not accounting for the capacity of minority-owned small businesses and only addressing a small fraction of regions in the United States. Other statistical data and anecdotes were also deemed insufficient by the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit criticized disparity studies and anecdotal evidence used to support the SDB program, deeming them insufficient for race-conscious remedies. The lack of evidence of discrimination in DOD contracts was highlighted as significant, casting doubt on the government's ability to prove \"passive participation\" in discrimination. Ultimately, the Rothe decision holds particular significance for these reasons. The Rothe decision is significant as it now governs constitutional challenges to minority set-aside programs in bid protests related to federal procurements. It places a heavy evidentiary burden on Congress for enacting race-conscious legislation, requiring strong support through hearings and legislative findings. Courts have considered challenges to the SBA's \u00a7 8(a) program for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, with some upholding its constitutionality but requiring proof of a history of discrimination in the industry. Other courts have denied challenges to the racial presumption in the program, citing disqualification based on social and economic disadvantage rather than race. Legal challenges to the program are pending, while state and local affirmative action programs face constitutional objections from courts applying strict scrutiny. Federal circuit courts have addressed the legality of racial considerations in these programs. Several federal circuit courts have addressed the legality of racial preferences in employment and public contracting programs since the Supreme Court's ruling in Croson. Croson emphasized the need for state and local governments to provide strong evidence of past discrimination to justify affirmative action efforts. In Croson, a 30% set-aside for minority subcontractors adopted by the City of Richmond was found unconstitutional due to lack of specific evidence of discrimination and improper comparison methods. The City of Richmond's 30% quota for minority subcontractors was deemed too inflexible and lacked consideration of race-neutral alternatives. The waiver in the plan was criticized for being rigid and not addressing past discrimination. Following the Croson decision, many jurisdictions reevaluated their minority business enterprise programs, with some surviving legal challenges while others failed due to lack of compelling justification or narrow tailoring. After the Adarand decision in 1995, studies on minority exclusion from public contracting faced judicial rejection due to reliance on general population data and failure to tailor remedies to disparities. Courts have yet to resolve issues like fact-finding standards and considering race-neutral alternatives. The first issue discussed is whether different fact-finding standards apply to state or local minority contracting initiatives or state plans adopted to enforce federal law. Despite the Croson decision, three circuit courts suggest that no independent findings may be needed to establish a \"compelling\" governmental interest when a state agency acts under federal mandate to address discrimination on federally funded projects. The principle is that evidence compiled by Congress for a federal program can support nationwide action. In Western State Paving Co. v. Washington DOT, the Ninth Circuit reviewed challenges to state programs mandated by federal law. The court found that Washington must meet strict scrutiny to survive an as-applied challenge, showing that its program is narrowly tailored based on discrimination in the state's transportation contracting industry. Washington failed to establish discrimination through statistical studies, and arguments based on minority contractor participation were rejected. The court rejected arguments based on minority contractor participation percentages, stating they do not prove discrimination. Anecdotal evidence of discrimination was lacking in Washington. The court emphasized that a remedial program must be narrowly tailored to address actual discrimination. The Seventh Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Northern Contracting Inc. v. State of Illinois. The court found that the state's DBE program was justified in remedying discrimination in highway contracting and was narrowly tailored to achieve this compelling interest. In contrast, a different Seventh Circuit ruling in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. County of Cook found that Cook County's minority contracting program lacked a compelling interest and failed to establish discrimination. The County presented statistical data showing a lack of solicitation of minority- or women-owned firms for subcontract work, but this evidence did not convince the court of systematic discrimination. The appeals court also noted that the program did not connect its set-aside levels to market availability. The Western States Paving case could impact future challenges to affirmative action programs, requiring state programs to prove discrimination on a state-by-state basis. Federal programs may also face scrutiny as their statistical justification weakens over time. DOT has issued guidance on the effects of the Western States Paving case. The Supreme Court's ruling in Shaw v. Hunt emphasized the need for strong evidence to support race-based governmental actions. The Tenth Circuit decision in Adarand III allowed for post-enactment evidence to be considered in addition to congressional findings when applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications. The Supreme Court declined to address issues related to strict scrutiny in response to the Tenth Circuit ruling in Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc. v. City and County of Denver, which examined a city ordinance promoting participation by minority- and female-owned businesses in public projects. The ordinance set goals for MBE and WBE participation, with statutory goals of 16% for MBEs and 12% for WBEs in total annual expenditures. The city revised the program in 1996 and 1998, reducing the annual goals for MBEs and WBEs in construction contracts to 10% and prohibiting M/WBEs from counting self-performed work towards the goals. Concrete Works of Colorado, a construction firm owned by a white male, sued the city in 1992 for being denied contracts and sought injunctive relief and money damages. The city presented evidence of disparities in M/WBE availability and utilization on city projects without goals, as well as discrimination faced by M/WBEs in the construction industry. The principal issue in the case presented by Concrete Works was whether the government's evidence justified racial and gender preferences in public contracting. The circuit court found that proof of the city's own actions was unnecessary, as long as evidence of discriminatory exclusion in the local construction industry was shown. Denver was not required to identify specific discriminatory practices or policies, nor prove intent to disadvantage women or minorities. This approach allowed reliance on statistical studies and anecdotal evidence without imposing a burden of proving discrimination. The Tenth Circuit ruled that Denver did not need to show specific discriminatory policies in the construction industry to justify racial and gender preferences in public contracting. The trial court's criticism of the city's disparity studies for not controlling for firm size and experience was deemed irrelevant, as M/WBEs are generally smaller and less experienced due to discrimination. Construction firms, often smaller and less experienced due to discrimination, faced barriers to entry and fair competition for public contracts. The Supreme Court denied an appeal from Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc., with Justices Scalia and Rehnquist dissenting, arguing that Denver's policy violated the standards set in the Croson decision. The Supreme Court denied an appeal from Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc., with Justices Scalia and Rehnquist dissenting, arguing that Denver's policy violated the standards set in the Croson decision. Speculation suggests that the case has effectively been overruled, with concerns raised about the lack of evidence of pervasive discrimination in the set-asides for minority businesses. Justice Scalia criticized his fellow Justices for relying on the \"good faith\" of local governments to use racial preferences instead of requiring a \"strong basis in evidence.\""
