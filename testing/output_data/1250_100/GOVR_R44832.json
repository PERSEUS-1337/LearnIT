    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rise in retail drug spending, driven by new drug introductions and price increases. Despite a forecasted reduction in growth rate, retail drug spending is expected to outpace other medical spending areas. The report will address government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, direct-to-consumer advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. The report provides an overview of prescription drug spending in the United States, citing data from the National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts. In 2016, the US spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs, forecasted to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national healthcare spending. By 2027, prescription drug spending is projected to increase to about 11% of total healthcare spending. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total healthcare expenditures. Retail drug spending in the United States has ranged from 5% to 10% of total healthcare expenditures since 1960. Various studies provide estimates of total prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use. Different forecasts show a trend of increasing spending in recent years, with fluctuations in the pace of retail prescription drug spending over the decades. Retail drug spending in the United States has fluctuated over the decades, with a significant increase in spending from 2003 to 2013, followed by a slowdown in growth due to various factors. However, in 2014, retail drug spending saw a sharp increase of 12.4%, the largest in over a decade. Despite a slight decrease in growth in 2016, projections indicate an average annual growth rate of 6.3% through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail drug spending in the United States has fluctuated over the decades, with a significant increase from 2003 to 2013, followed by a slowdown in growth. In 2014, there was a sharp increase of 12.4%, driven by new high-cost drugs and price increases for existing drugs. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016, despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Projections indicate an average annual growth rate of 6.3% through 2027, with drugs expected to grow faster than other areas of health care spending. Hearings have been held on prescription drugs in response to the acceleration in spending and sharp increases in prices. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016, despite overall utilization rising, due to factors like fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and a deceleration in spending for diabetes treatments. Drug mix compares costs of new versus older drugs. FDA approved many new expensive specialty drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease in recent years. Introduction of new hepatitis C drugs significantly increased drug spending in 2014 and 2015. The impact of expensive hepatitis C drugs on U.S. drug spending is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated and net prices drop. Generic substitution played a smaller role in reducing spending since 2009 when patents for best-selling brand-name drugs expired. Changes in drug mix, including the rise of biologics with high prices, will continue to impact spending. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but savings from patent expirations have decreased since 2012. The FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for biologics that lost patent protection, but these biosimilars are not significantly cheaper than the original drugs. Prescription drug prices have been rising faster than overall U.S. inflation rates since 2014, driven by price increases for brand-name and new innovator drugs. Generic drug price increases have not been a major contributor to inflation according to a 2016 HHS study. The average price for brand-name drugs increased by 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices decreased by 8.7%. Biologics and specialty drugs drove much of the price inflation. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage boosted demand for drugs, leading to a 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015. Medicaid coverage expansion under the ACA also contributed to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging population, particularly the baby boomers, has led to a 20% increase in Medicaid prescription drug spending. Patients aged 50 and older accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. Out-of-pocket spending for filled prescriptions has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs covering a larger share of drug costs. Consumer cost sharing now represents a smaller portion of overall drug spending, but individuals may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on the type of drugs prescribed. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending. The share of plans with a drug deductible rose to 46% from 23% between 2012 and 2015. Tiered pricing and coinsurance are more common, with higher costs for expensive drugs. This places a greater financial burden on consumers, especially for employer-sponsored health plans. Consumers in employer-sponsored health plans are facing increased cost-sharing for prescription drugs, with higher prices for expensive drugs compared to generics. Despite some moderation in cost-sharing through ACA regulations and manufacturer assistance programs, the number of consumers with high out-of-pocket costs has risen, particularly for those with serious conditions or needing specialty drugs. Average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased overall, but the burden remains significant for certain individuals. Out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs in large employer-sponsored health plans declined overall, but nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with specialty drug out-of-pocket spending increasing by 46% from 2003 to 2014. Despite a forecasted gradual increase in out-of-pocket spending to $207 by 2026, it is expected to decline as a share of retail drug expenditures. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has risen from 25% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2017, and is forecasted to reach 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits. Various departments and agencies oversee different systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D and direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration. FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, but does not have the authority to set drug prices. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, with Medicaid rebates being larger than Part D rebates. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs. Medicare Part D is a federal health program designed for market competition among commercial payers for drug coverage. The program prohibits HHS Secretary from interfering in negotiations and formulary requirements. Congress debates the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and costs. Total Part D drug rebates have been below initial budget projections. Total Part D drug rebates have risen from 9.6% in 2007 to a forecasted 24% in 2018. Studies show that Part D plans have higher drug prices compared to Medicaid. Lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices to leverage the purchasing power of Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary was not allowed to negotiate Part D drug prices in a 2007 measure that was not approved by the Senate. A CBO analysis stated that significant savings would only be achieved if the Secretary had more authority to set prices or create a central formulary. Patient and consumer groups have opposed giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary, fearing it could reduce drug coverage. Lawmakers have introduced various bills to modify the noninterference provision, with the Obama and Trump Administrations recommending different approaches to negotiate drug prices and increase rebates for Part D enrollees. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's mandatory rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, potentially lowering costs in the first decade. However, savings may decrease over time as drug manufacturers raise prices to offset rebates. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, with some offering patient assistance programs for low-income residents. Various approaches are being used to limit spending on high-priced drugs and increase transparency in drug prices. Vermont sets a $250 cap on cost sharing for a 30-day drug supply. Similar laws in other states aim to force drug companies to justify prices. Some states prohibit gag clauses in pharmacy contracts. Maine allowed drug imports from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, but a federal court ruled it unconstitutional in 2015. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with projections showing a rise to 45% of global drug spending by 2021. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, compared to the OECD average of $553. Studies have found significant price differences for drugs between the U.S. and other countries, with U.S. prices often double those in the European Union. Various reasons have been suggested for the higher U.S. spending and prices. Reasons for higher U.S. spending on prescription drugs include faster adoption of new drugs, market exclusivity for manufacturers, and different pricing mechanisms compared to OECD countries. Countries like Canada use value-based pricing, while the U.S. is experimenting with alternative pricing models. The U.S. government and commercial payers are exploring alternative pricing models for prescription drugs. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has a deal with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on health improvement goals. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to shift towards value-based purchasing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing reports on drug effectiveness and cost, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. The federal government focuses on basic research while the pharmaceutical industry funds clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging due to the overlap between basic and applied research. Studies show that a small percentage of new drugs originate from sources other than private industry. FDA categorizes truly innovative new drugs as new molecular entities (NMEs). A 2011 study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Priority review was granted to 19% of applications from publicly funded research institutions, compared to 20% from private-sector research. The FDA grants priority review for drugs that show significant improvements in safety or effectiveness. Data suggests that Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. A 2011 study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to new drug classes approved by the FDA. The platforms developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies, were excluded from the study. Public funding was found to be associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016, highlighting the significant contribution of NIH funding to drug development. The study found that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, or about $100 billion, was associated with research contributing to new drug approvals from 2010-2016. This suggests a greater NIH contribution to drug research than previously thought. Pharmaceutical companies disclose overall research spending, but specific drug development costs are not usually available. Academic studies estimate average spending for drug development based on data from large drug manufacturers. The cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug is estimated to be between $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion, with $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Academic and government research have questioned the assumptions made in these cost estimates, including the rate of return needed to attract capital, the mix of drugs sampled, and the impact of federal tax breaks. Price transparency legislation is being debated in Congress and state legislatures to compel drugmakers to provide data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Research costs are not always a primary factor in drug pricing, as seen in the case of Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Gilead's pricing strategy focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. The United States allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses from taxes. DTC advertising is part of the industry's promotion efforts, along with marketing to healthcare providers. Pharmaceutical advertising to physicians and healthcare providers has evolved since 1962 when FDA gained authority over prescription drug advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily increased, reaching over $6 billion in 2012. Recent data shows a rapid growth in DTC advertising in recent years. Pharmaceutical advertising spending increased by 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015, with a focus on new drug promotions. Internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing segment of direct-to-consumer advertising, while TV and newspaper ads still dominate. FDA regulations require drug companies to submit ads for review, with internet promotions on the rise compared to flat TV promotions. Proponents argue that pharmaceutical advertising leads to more informed consumers who take a proactive role in their healthcare. Critics argue that pharmaceutical advertising may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. Studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs, with a 10% rise in advertising views leading to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions. Concerns also exist about the effectiveness and safety of new brand-name drugs with higher prices compared to existing treatments. The debate over direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug advertising has gained attention due to concerns about public health and spending. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, citing worries about promoting drugs without sufficient safety evidence. Constitutional issues may arise due to the protection of commercial speech under the First Amendment. Manufacturers are focusing ad dollars on newly introduced products, raising concerns about the safety and effectiveness of these drugs. The Institute of Medicine recommended FDA restrict DTC advertising of new drugs for two years after introduction. Congress has debated but not approved a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Legislation was introduced to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States with detailed requirements for safety and effectiveness. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved drug can legally bring it back into the US. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed importation of FDA-approved drugs, but in practice, it has not been allowed. The MEDS Act required certification that importation would pose no additional risk to public health before implementation. Congress included a reworking of the MEDS Act provision in 2003 in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003 (MMA; P.L. 108-173), which also created Medicare Part D. The importation provision has never been carried out, prohibiting consumers, pharmacists, and wholesalers from importing prescription drugs from abroad. Lawmakers have attempted to use the annual agriculture appropriations bill to bypass administrative obstacles to prescription drug importation. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing restrictions on personal importation of prescription drugs, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply for personal use. This policy was not originally intended for consumers to access lower-priced drugs. The intent is to save FDA resources and permit individuals to access medical treatments not available in the US. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing restrictions on personal importation of prescription drugs, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply for personal use to access medical treatments not available in the US. Some states have tried to enact laws allowing drug importation for lower prices. The Senate has held hearings on sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs and the monopoly business model of pharmaceutical companies. They have also examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration and the cost of prescription drugs according to a report by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The Senate has conducted hearings on the cost of prescription drugs, including discussions on regulatory barriers inhibiting pharmaceutical competition and accelerating patient access to generic drugs. The Senate has conducted hearings on accelerating patient access to generic drugs and biosimilar implementation. The curr_chunk discusses various hearings related to FDA regulations and drug access, including topics such as investigational drugs, over-the-counter drugs, prescription drug user fees, generic drugs, biosimilars, Medicare drug experiments, and antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process. The curr_chunk provides links to hearings on topics such as competition in pharmacy markets, federally funded cancer research, voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, rising prices of EpiPens, and developments in the prescription drug market."
