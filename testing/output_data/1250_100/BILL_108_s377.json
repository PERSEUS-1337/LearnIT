Efforts are underway to secure Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s personal papers for the Library of Congress to preserve and study for future generations. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins with specific specifications, including weight, diameter, and composition. These coins will be legal tender.
