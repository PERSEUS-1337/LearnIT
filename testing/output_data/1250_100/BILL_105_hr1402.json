    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions of dollars for companies. Federal use of probabilistic methods lags behind industry, but they hold promise for better understanding of safety and environmental risks. Proper application can lead to more business-friendly regulations and reduce costs associated with overdesign. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability. The quantification of uncertainties can benefit various components of the transportation system and other Federal agencies like the Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to quantify uncertainties in the transportation system and benefit other Federal agencies. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify, assess, evaluate, establish models, recommend guidelines, and set reliability levels to help the Department of Transportation maximize return on investment, increase public safety, and quantify uncertainties in major programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for creating databases, determine means of expediting technology transfer, identify legal and cultural barriers, make recommendations for using probabilistic methods in programs, institutionalize values, and suggest pilot projects for evaluation. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP.
