    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and government accounts, including trust funds like Social Security. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by government surpluses or deficits. Debt held in government accounts is influenced by net financial flows. Federal borrowing from the public has increased in most years since the late 1950s. The federal government has been accumulating debt due to persistent budget deficits, leading to the need to issue more debt. The growth in federal debt held by the public and trust funds has required Congress to raise the debt limit periodically. When federal debt nears its legal limit, standard methods of financing government activities can be hindered. Monthly surpluses and deficits affect the level of debt, even if the government has an annual surplus. The Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. If the debt limit restricts borrowing, the government may struggle to meet its legal obligations on time, leading to potential cash flow issues and difficulties in investing surpluses in federal debt. The Government Accountability Office warns that delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Defaulting on interest payments on Treasury securities could trigger a global financial crisis. Delaying payments on obligations effectively borrows from vendors, contractors, and others, incurring interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Several credit ratings agencies and investment banks are concerned about delayed tax refunds impacting the financial system and economy. If the U.S. Treasury cannot fund federal obligations, there could be significant effects on global capital markets. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies, such as suspending debt sales and withholding receipts, to manage debt during debt ceiling constraints. The Treasury has the authority to use strategies like invoking a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to handle cash and debt management responsibilities. Some responses to the credit crunch in 2007 expanded the Treasury's options. The U.S. Treasury's response to the credit crunch in 2007 expanded its options, including selling off mortgage-backed securities to manage debt. However, the Treasury's portfolio of MBSs has been eliminated as of March 2012. Other asset sales are unlikely to sustain smooth debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama has rejected this idea. The debt limit can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage the federal government's finances. In extreme cases, the Treasury must take unusual measures to meet federal obligations. The debt limit provides Congress with control over federal spending and imposes fiscal accountability. Some propose using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama has rejected this idea. The debt limit provides Congress with control over federal spending and imposes fiscal accountability. Some budget experts advocate eliminating the debt limit, arguing that other controls in the congressional budget process have superseded it. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval. Committees on Appropriations handle discretionary spending, authorizing committees manage mandatory program spending, and Committees on the Budget draft an overall budgetary framework. Measures involving the debt limit often provide individual Members with leverage. Members not belonging to committees can influence federal fiscal policy through measures involving the debt limit. Congress has historically placed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Before World War I, borrowing was authorized for specific purposes, with Congress specifying details of debt instruments. Some opponents raised concerns about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies, while proponents argued that federal borrowing would not disrupt settlements. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. It granted the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $100 million in short-term certificates and $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds. Proponents intended to give the Secretary administrative leeway within those limits, which expanded over time. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 helped finance the United States. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 expanded borrowing capacity for financing World War I, dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. Subsequent borrowing measures were made as amendments to the act until 1982, reflecting changes in legislative drafting practices. In the 1920s, Congress gave Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon leeway to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues, allowing the issuance of notes and limiting the amount outstanding. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing for more efficient management of public debt. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau called for a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds in 1935, emphasizing their role in managing federal finances. Congress then established a $20 limit on bond issuance. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury more flexibility in issuing bonds to manage public debt efficiently. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other debt types. The law (P.L. 76-201) enacted on July 20, 1939, created an aggregate limit of $45 billion, combining a $30 billion bond limit with a $15 billion shorter-term debt limit. This allowed the Treasury to roll over maturing notes into longer-term bonds, reducing interest costs and financial risks. During World War II, the U.S. debt limit was raised to accommodate increasing costs, reaching $300 billion in 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion and remained unchanged until 1954 due to the Korean War being financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Eisenhower Administration requested a debt limit increase in 1953, but Congress only approved temporary increases until 1957. Congress raised the limit in February 1958 to promote better financial management. Since then, there have been 78 measures altering the debt limit, with recent large increases like the $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. Despite surpluses in the late 1990s, public debt has grown due to persistent budget deficits since 2001. Debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits, while debt held in government accounts has also increased. Federal debt held by government accounts has been steadily growing since 1982, partly due to increases in Social Security taxes. Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP grew through the mid-1990s, but shrank after surpluses in the late 1990s. Large deficits returned, leading to an increase in debt as a percentage of GDP. Debt held by the public increased as deficits reemerged in the early 2000s, putting pressure on the debt limit. By FY2002, debt subject to limit was close to the existing $5,950 billion limit, with increases in debt held by government accounts and debt held by the public contributing to the rise. The Administration anticipated reaching the debt limit soon due to a deteriorating budget outlook and continued growth in debt held by government accounts. In early December 2001, the Administration asked Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion as debt approached the limit. By April 2002, the Treasury avoided reaching the limit by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. This allowed the Treasury to issue new debt and meet obligations. Despite debt subject to limit standing at $5,949,975 million on April 15, tax revenues helped the Treasury stay below the limit. By the end of April, debt subject to limit fell back $35 billion below the limit. In May 2002, the Treasury was close to reaching the statutory debt limit again, prompting a request to Congress for an increase. Without this increase, the Treasury used extraordinary measures to avoid default, including suspending investments in trust funds and issuing new debt. These actions were expected to sustain the government's operations until at least June. The Treasury indicated that without a debt limit increase by June 28, 2002, it would need to take actions to avoid breaching the ceiling. By June 21, a regular securities auction was postponed, but no further actions were taken. With impending payments and obligations at the end of June and beginning of July, the Treasury warned of exhausting options to issue debt, risking government default. Congress debated increasing the debt limit in May and June 2002, with the House passing a bill including language for a potential increase, while the Senate showed reluctance. On June 11, the Senate passed a bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. The House passed the increase by a single vote on June 27, and the President signed it into law on June 28. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the debt limit to avoid financial problems. By February 20, 2003, the Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings to prevent reaching the limit. The Treasury took actions to manage debt holdings in certain government accounts to avoid reaching the debt limit. These actions allowed for additional debt issuance to acquire cash needed for government commitments. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The Senate passed the debt-limit legislation on May 23, with debt just below the existing limit. In May 2003, the Senate passed legislation to raise the debt limit to $7,384 billion, just before reaching the existing limit. By October 2004, the Treasury warned that measures to avoid breaching the limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's ability to meet obligations. The U.S. government faced challenges in meeting its financial obligations as the debt limit approached in 2004. Despite the House passing a budget resolution for FY2005, no final agreement was reached with the Senate. Without a resolution, no measure to raise the debt limit could be passed automatically. Efforts to remove Treasury's flexibility in financing the government were made, but no legislation was moved to raise the debt limit. Senator Frist later introduced a bill to raise the debt limit by $800 billion in November 2004. In November 2004, legislation (S. 2986) was introduced to raise the debt limit by $800 billion. The Senate and House approved the increase, and the President signed it into law (P.L. 108-415). The Treasury rescheduled a debt auction and canceled a \"debt limit suspension period.\" Subsequent debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 followed a less dramatic path. The Senate Finance Committee did not report a bill to raise the debt limit despite instructions for a $781 billion increase to $8,965 billion by September 30, 2005. The House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) was automatically passed to raise the debt limit, but the Senate had not considered it by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Treasury Secretary Snow warned that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006 and requested an increase. In February and March 2006, Treasury Secretary Snow informed Congress of measures taken to avoid reaching the debt limit, including a debt issuance suspension period. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, raising it to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. In July 2007, the Treasury requested another debt limit increase. In September 2007, the Treasury requested a debt limit increase from Congress, which was approved and signed by the President. This was amidst financial market turmoil and the onset of a recession that lasted until 2009, leading to federal actions to stabilize the housing and financial markets. The recession from 2007 to 2009 led to major actions to unfreeze credit markets, boost consumption, and increase spending. It also caused federal deficits to increase, reaching 9.8% of GDP. Falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, while job cuts and unemployment led to lower income tax revenues. Automatic stabilizers like unemployment insurance increased federal spending. Despite declining deficits since FY2009, the economic recovery has been weak compared to post-World War II recessions. Deficit spending can stimulate the economy if output levels are below potential, but it can also lead to inflation if output levels are near capacity. The federal government's budget deficits exceeded projections in FY2008 and FY2009, resulting in a significant increase in the national debt. The recession prompted actions to boost the economy, including raising the federal debt limit multiple times. The House and Senate proposed budget resolutions recommended policies that would further increase the federal debt limit. The House and Senate proposed budget resolutions recommended policies that would increase the federal debt limit. The budget conference report passed, leading to a debt subject to limit of $10,207 billion in FY2009. The House passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, which was later signed into law by the President. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created to oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, with concerns about potential taxpayer costs. FHFA placed the agencies in conservatorship in 2008 to stabilize financial markets. The federal government took action to stabilize financial markets in 2008 by proposing to buy mortgage-related assets. The Treasury Secretary was authorized to purchase up to $700 billion in securities, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. After some amendments and rejections, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (H.R. 1424) was passed by the Senate and House, signed into law to raise the debt limit. Congress also considered an economic stimulus measure with tax cuts and spending increases. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included tax cuts and spending increases, raising the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget resolution for FY2010 recommended policies leading to a debt limit of $13,233 billion, triggering the Gephardt rule. In August 2009, Treasury Secretary Geithner warned Congress of reaching the debt limit in mid-October. The U.S. Treasury later postponed the limit until December by reducing loans and considering scaling back the TARP program. Repayments from financial institutions could also lower the debt subject to the limit. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury faced challenges in managing debt due to scheduled payments and limited debt limit increase. Legislation was passed to raise the debt limit to $12,394 billion, allowing normal operations for two months. The Senate passed an amended version of H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling by $1,900 billion. An amendment for a national commission on federal debt was not approved. President Obama established a Fiscal Commission to address fiscal sustainability. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on a 233-187 vote on February 4, 2010, forwarding the measure to the President. The Obama Administration strongly supported a debt limit increase, and the President signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, reinstating statutory caps on discretionary spending and other means of constraining federal spending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced on May 16, 2011, that the federal debt had reached its limit, leading to a debt issuance suspension period until about August 2, 2011. On July 1, 2011, the U.S. Treasury confirmed that its borrowing authority would be exhausted. The FY2011 federal deficit is projected to reach $1,399 billion, leading to limited time before the government can meet financial obligations. Cutting spending to slow debt growth was suggested, but the scale of required reductions would equal total discretionary spending for the last five months of FY2011. The U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund on July 15, exhausting borrowing authority by August 2. Funding federal operations could become complicated without a debt limit increase. Without a debt limit increase, federal operations could face complications as cash inflows are projected to be significantly less than outflows. Estimates on when the debt limit would bind and how long extraordinary measures would suffice have shifted. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have provided some additional headroom. Treasury estimates on reaching the debt limit align closely with others' calculations, requiring analysis of federal spending patterns and receipts. The Treasury Secretary planned to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, 2011, unless Congress acted beforehand to extend borrowing capacity. Measures like the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program had already been taken. New issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended. Secretary Geithner had requested an increase in the debt limit earlier, stating that federal debt would likely reach its limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. The Treasury Secretary warned Congress that federal debt would reach its limit between April 15 and May 31, 2011. Despite efforts to raise the debt limit with bills like H.R. 1954 and the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011, they were defeated. Eventually, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law on August 2, 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) was signed into law (P.L. 112-25) after House and Senate approval, eliminating the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. The BCA included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and a mechanism for raising the debt ceiling. The legislation provided a three-step procedure for increasing the debt limit, with the first step raising it by $400 billion to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011. In September 2011, a $500 billion debt limit increase was triggered by the President's certification. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure, while the House passed one. In late December 2011, the debt limit was close to its statutory limit, prompting a potential $1.2 trillion increase. The President delayed the request to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. After failing to reach the required two-thirds threshold in the House, a balanced budget amendment for ratification was not achieved, limiting the debt increase to $1.2 trillion. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction also failed to agree on recommendations for a higher debt limit increase. As a result, the debt limit was raised by $1.2 trillion to match budget reductions planned through sequestration over the FY2013-FY2021 period. This section briefly summarizes debt limit policy developments post-2011. In 2012, the debt limit was temporarily suspended until May 19, 2013, allowing the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used for federal payments. After the suspension ended, the debt limit was reset at $16,699 billion, $305 billion higher than before. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance on May 20, 2013. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period (DISP) in September 2013, pushing back the expected exhaustion of borrowing capacity to no later than October 17. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, suspending the debt limit until February 8, 2014. After the suspension ended, the debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion. On February 11, 2014, Congress approved a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to meet financial obligations until the end of October 2015. On October 15, 2015, Secretary Lew announced that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion available. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected. Estimates varied on when federal obligations could be met, with projections ranging from November to early December 2015. A \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues, including resetting the debt limit on March 16, 2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017, with measures to offset those increases. The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing its debt, but deficits returned due to higher military and security spending. Projections of large surpluses in 2001 could have eliminated the debt limit issue for the decade. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession led to large federal deficits, necessitating debt limit increases. Fiscal concerns peaked in 2011 but have since diminished as deficits decreased with economic recovery. FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP, down from 9.8% in FY2009. Federal health program costs and interest expenses rose less than expected. Net interest expenses have risen less rapidly than expected, but without major changes in federal policies, growing deficits could substantially increase federal debt. CBO warns that the current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable and could lead to slower economic growth in the long run. Congress may need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing federal debt. Debt Subject to Limit data shows an increase in total federal debt since FY2001, the last year of a budget surplus. Since the end of FY2001, total federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Despite periodic reductions, all three measures have shown an overall increasing trend. Major debt measures before the United States entered World War II are also discussed."
