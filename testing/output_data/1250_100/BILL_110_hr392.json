    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act\" and involves the issuance of redesigned quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and each of the territories. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection for the redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and the territories in 2009. The designs on the reverse side of the coins will be emblematic of the District of Columbia and the territories, with flexibility in the placement of inscriptions. The reverse side of quarter dollars will feature inscriptions and values, with designs emblematic of the District of Columbia and territories like Puerto Rico and Guam in 2009. Designs will be selected by the Secretary after consultation with relevant authorities. The designs for quarter dollars may be submitted and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts. The selection and approval process will be developed by the Secretary, who may include participation from District or territorial officials, artists, engravers, and the general public. The Secretary shall ensure that quarter dollar designs are dignified and not frivolous or inappropriate. No portraits of living or deceased individuals are allowed. The coins minted under this subsection will be treated as numismatic items and issued in uncirculated and proof qualities as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may mint quarter dollars with 90% silver content for the District of Columbia and territories in 2009. Coins will be issued in a specific order, and if a territory becomes a state, the provisions will apply. If a territory becomes a state within 10 years, specific provisions will apply. If a territory becomes independent before quarter dollars are minted with its emblem, this subsection will no longer apply to that territory. The term 'territory' includes Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The House of Representatives passed the bill on January 23, 2007. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
