    "content": "Cybercrime is on the rise, with data breaches exposing millions of personal financial records. The average cost of a cybercrime incident in FY2014 was $12.7 million, up from $11.6 million in FY2013. The global economy loses about $445 billion to cybercrime annually. The risks to critical infrastructure and national security from cyberattacks are significant. Increasing cybersecurity is a priority for President Obama and some Members of Congress. Sharing information about cyberattacks could help companies improve their cybersecurity at a low cost. The aftermath of a data breach involves various steps such as detection, containment, repair, incident response, investigation, and notifying law enforcement, other companies, customers, and stockholders. Sharing information about cyberattacks is hindered by misaligned incentives. Companies notify different groups for various reasons, including hoping for justice, improving security through information sharing, and enabling customers to prevent financial fraud. Publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to disclose information that could impact investors' decisions. The report analyzes information sharing between government and private companies, among private companies, and the economic incentives in cybersecurity. Companies facing cybersecurity breaches do not bear the full cost, with retailers facing chargebacks and credit card issuers not fully compensated. Consumers need to monitor financial accounts to guard against cyberattacks. Software companies balance security benefits with release delays, sometimes pressured to \"ship early, ship often\" and fix bugs later. Many in the cybersecurity field suggest increasing information sharing between individuals, companies, and governments to improve security. Sharing ways to detect attacks, recovery from breaches, and other information can be beneficial. Legislation has been introduced to promote information sharing, which is considered critical for effective cybersecurity. Organizations can learn about compromised information from third parties like law enforcement. Sharing cybersecurity information can have benefits, such as aiding in the detection of cyberattacks and allowing for the development of countermeasures. However, sharing with competitors may lead to security lessons being revealed and potential revenue loss. There are concerns about scaring customers away and potential stock price declines if a cyber breach is publicly disclosed. In 47 states and the District of Columbia, companies must notify consumers of breached personally identifiable information (PII). Consumers are advised to monitor financial accounts closely and may be offered free credit monitoring. Public disclosure of breaches can potentially tip off attackers or waste time. There is a lack of optimal information sharing about cyberattacks, which can lead to harm. Information sharing can increase security, as seen in the Target credit card hack. Home Depot fell victim to a similar attack through a compromised vendor. The importance of information sharing in improving cybersecurity is highlighted, with concerns raised by firms about privacy, antitrust laws, and proprietary information. The Department of Justice has provided guidance to alleviate these fears. However, there are still concerns that firms are withholding valuable information that could enhance cybersecurity efforts. Sharing information about cyberattacks and defenses can lead to faster breach detection and reduced damage. Sharing breach information and joint research efforts could lead to new ways to protect information, but there are concerns about unresolved legal questions, privacy issues, and free-riding behavior. Public disclosure of breaches may impact stock prices and customer trust. Despite fears, evidence suggests that firms are hesitant to share cybersecurity information. Target's stock price increased after its data breach, highlighting the complex factors at play. From December 18, 2013, to three months later, Target's stock price increased by 19%, outperforming Costco, Walmart, and Best Buy. The Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) Council highlighted the challenges of sharing cybersecurity information, citing concerns about risks and costs. A survey of IT executives revealed that the main worry about data breaches was the loss of consumer confidence and revenue. Game theory scenarios were explored to understand why companies may hesitate to share cybersecurity information. Some firms may choose to develop a custom countermeasure or share information about cyber threats based on potential reputational benefits. Industries making similar products may benefit more from information sharing, but competitive concerns may hinder sharing. Strong industry associations could help overcome this reluctance. Some firms may choose to develop a custom countermeasure or share information about cyber threats for reputational benefits. Organizations may hesitate to share information to maintain a competitive advantage. However, some firms may prioritize national security and economic growth over immediate economic incentives, leading them to share information despite potential drawbacks. After a data breach, organizations may bring in outside experts to investigate and remediate the breach. These consultants, who are bound by confidentiality agreements, can use their knowledge to assist other companies. Cyberinsurance companies also play a role in assessing cybersecurity practices and conducting investigations after a breach, gathering technical information to prevent future incidents. Legislation has been introduced to encourage information sharing among organizations, focusing on sharing new threat information and best practices. Information sharing after a data breach involves sharing details about new threats, known threats, and best practices. This can include notifying other firms about stolen information or system issues. Automatic sharing of certain information, like malware detection, can maximize its value. However, issues can arise with machine autonomy, as seen in Target's 2013 data breach where security measures were not fully utilized. Machine autonomy has issues with identifying sensitive information. Attackers could exploit autonomous sharing software. Trust and technical expertise are crucial for effective machine-to-machine sharing. Different sectors have varying information sharing requirements, with government contractors facing stricter rules. Critical infrastructure industries rely on ISACs for information sharing. Presidential Decision Directive 63 authorized the creation of ISACs for critical infrastructure protection. ISACs, authorized by Presidential Decision Directive 63, assist in creating sector-specific information sharing entities. These private-sector, nonprofit organizations collect, analyze, and share cybersecurity threat information and best practices. ISACs like the Defense Industrial Base and Oil and Natural Gas facilitate anonymous information sharing among members and with the government. The government also utilizes ISACs for rapid sector communication, especially during emergencies. Various sectors, including critical infrastructure and non-critical sectors like Retail, have established ISACs. The Multi-State ISAC covers all states, territories, and local governments, while the electricity sector ISAC includes most electricity providers. Despite their sector specificity, ISACs play a crucial role in modern corporate information sharing. The Financial Services ISAC (FS-ISAC) offers membership tiers ranging from free to platinum, costing $49,950 annually. Participation rates vary among firms, with 60% of large banking organizations and 25% of small organizations being members. The IT-ISAC has 33 members, including large cybersecurity vendors, but major IT companies like Google and Facebook are not members. IT-ISAC shares information with other organizations in the IT sector. The IT-ISAC shares information with other organizations like the IT Sector Coordinating Council, which includes companies like Google and Facebook. ISACs cannot prevent free-riding, which may discourage information sharing. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose cybersecurity risks promptly. Cybersecurity breaches may require weeks or months of investigation before disclosure. Some experts advocate mandatory sharing of cybersecurity breach information to prevent duplication of work and improve security. Others prefer a voluntary approach to reduce regulatory costs for businesses and taxpayers. Inadequate information sharing is believed to lead to suboptimal security measures. The sharing of cybersecurity breach information can prevent duplication of work and improve security. Information differences between buyers and sellers of cybersecurity products may lower the market size and quality, similar to the concept of a \"market for lemons.\" This can lead to difficulty in selling high-quality products at their true value, resulting in underinvestment in product development and decreased overall market quality. The lack of information sharing in the cybersecurity market hinders the ability to assess the effectiveness of security products. This leads to fewer quality products available for buyers, potentially resulting in underinvestment in cybersecurity. Sharing information can improve market quality, prevent duplication of effort, and enhance overall security in cyberspace. Currently, a main enforcement mechanism for cybersecurity is the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) authority to sue companies for deceptive practices. Greater information sharing could make it easier for companies to implement uniform security practices, but it may also overwhelm with an excessive amount of information, potentially weakening cybersecurity. ISACs can help analyze and sort out important information to mitigate this issue. Greater information sharing can help the growth of the cyberinsurance market by improving risk assessment and security product effectiveness. Insurers promote safer practices, leading to a more secure cyberspace. However, cyberinsurance may have limited utility due to intangible losses like reputation damage. Two bills in the 114th Congress could impact organizations' willingness to share cybersecurity information. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43996, Cybersecurity and Information Sharing: Comparison of H.R. 1560 and H.R. 1731. On April 22, 2015, the House passed H.R. 1560, Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), and on April 23, 2015, it passed H.R. 1731, National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 (NCPA). H.R. 1560 authorizes voluntary sharing of cybersecurity information between the federal government and nonfederal entities without conditions. H.R. 1731 addresses possible conflicts in provisions between the two bills. H.R. 1560 allows for voluntary sharing of cybersecurity information between federal and nonfederal entities without conditions. It preempts laws that could require disclosure of shared information and provides assistance to small businesses for participation. The bill also protects nonfederal entities from legal action for sharing information, allows for sharing without violating antitrust laws, and amends parts of the National Security Act of 1947 and Homeland Security Act of 2002. Title I and Title II of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA) assign different responsibilities for collecting and sharing government information. The legislation allows for voluntary two-way sharing of information between federal and nonfederal entities, prohibiting the government from making sharing a condition for receiving information. It also requires the government to share information without compromising security, privacy, and civil liberties, preempting any laws that could require disclosure of shared information. S. 754 and H.R. 1560 propose legislation for federal government information sharing, assigning lead responsibility to the Director of National Intelligence. They aim to encourage information sharing among nonfederal entities, protecting shared information against disclosure and private lawsuits. Antitrust laws would not be violated when sharing cybersecurity information under S. 754. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice policy on cybersecurity information sharing does not violate antitrust laws. H.R. 1560 and S. 754 aim to increase cybersecurity information sharing without significantly increasing costs. Informal information sharing networks could develop as a result of these bills. Some informal networks may lack technical capabilities of ISACs but can deter free-riding. Cybersecurity companies share information with clients in real time. The cost of full membership in ISAOs or ISACs is too high for small- and medium-size businesses. Recent data breaches may change attitudes of senior management, as seen with Target and Sony Entertainment CEOs resigning."
