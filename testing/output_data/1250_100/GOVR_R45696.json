    "content": "This report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles, the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The provisions focus on federal forest management, forest assistance programs, and forestry research. The report primarily examines the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, focusing on federal forest management by the Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). It covers background information on the National Forest System (NFS) and BLM's public lands, as well as laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). The provisions in the report address project planning, wildland fire management, forest management programs, and other related issues. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System (NFS) consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed management of national forests to protect watersheds, provide timber, and added recreation, grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection as official uses under the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (MUSY) and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) require the Forest Service to coordinate resource management for multiple uses and prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans with public involvement. Plans must comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Forest plans outline desired resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. The Forest Service coordinates resource management for multiple uses and prepares land management plans with public involvement. Projects implement forest plans and must comply with applicable requirements. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests, under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages forested lands in Oregon and California under the principle of sustained yield for timber production, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. BLM must comply with comprehensive resource management plans and federal laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA for proposed activities. Compliance with NEPA depends on the environmental impact of the proposed action. The level of environmental impact determines the need for an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA) under NEPA regulations. Agencies evaluate proposed actions and alternatives, including a no-action alternative, to inform decision-making. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with minimal environmental effects exempt from EIS or EA requirements. FS and BLM have identified CEs based on past experience, some established by Congress. In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, federal agencies identify actions that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE. FS and BLM regulations also address resource conditions that may warrant further analysis in an EA or EIS, termed extraordinary circumstances. These include flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species, wilderness areas, and roadless areas. The NEPA process identifies potential environmental impacts and requirements for projects, serving as an umbrella compliance process. Compliance with NEPA may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under other laws like ESA and NHPA. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands. Forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands aim to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires by removing biomass that fuels wildland fires. HFRA authorizes expedited planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land. At-Risk Communities are areas with infrastructure at risk from large-scale wildfires. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects involve methods to reduce hazardous fuels. HFRA Projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels through prescribed fire, mechanical methods, and wildland fire use. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are used to prioritize and assess these projects. Wildland-Urban Interface areas are targeted for fuel reduction projects, including at-risk communities and lands with environmental threats. HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels through prescribed fire, mechanical methods, and wildland fire use. Projects are prioritized based on Fire Regimes and Condition Classes, targeting Wildland-Urban Interface areas and at-risk communities. HFRA excludes projects in designated wilderness areas and requires adherence to land management plans. Objections to proposed projects must be filed within 30 days of draft decision documents. The HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels through prescribed fire, mechanical methods, and wildland fire use. Objections to proposed projects must be filed within 30 days of draft decision documents. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. If no comments were received on a project, no objections will be accepted. The objection process must be exhausted before seeking judicial review in federal court. Congress directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all FS projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, allowing the Chief of the Forest Service to designate landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. These areas must be experiencing declining forest health, at risk of substantial tree mortality, or have hazard trees posing a safety risk. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated as insect and disease treatment areas. Projects within these areas aim to reduce the risk of insect or disease infestations. Projects initiated before the end of FY2018 are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects under HFRA. They must follow HFRA's objections process, involve collaboration with government entities and interested parties, use the best available science, and prioritize the retention of old-growth and large trees. Projects in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one alternative, while projects outside the WUI must consider a no-action alternative. Congress authorized the Forest Service to designate Insect and Disease (I&D) areas within the National Forest System, prioritize projects in these areas, and implement them through an expedited process. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states under expedited project planning procedures. Some states have designated all eligible lands, making prioritization benefits ineffective. The 2014 farm bill added a new Section 603 to HFRA, exempting certain projects from NEPA requirements to reduce insect or disease infestations. The 2018 farm bill prioritized hazardous fuels projects for implementation through categorical exclusions. Projects eligible for the 2014 Farm Bill CE must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or consider the best available science. They must maximize old-growth tree retention, be developed collaboratively, and not exceed 3,000 acres. Projects must be located within designated I&D areas or in specific fire regime groups. FS policy requires documenting decisions using a Farm Bill CE through a decision memorandum. The 2018 Farm Bill CE allows for projects to build fuel or fire breaks using HFRA authorities, with procedures to expedite priority projects in I&D areas. The bill also reauthorized the use of procedures to reduce hazardous fuels as a priority project category. The 2018 Farm Bill CE allows for hazardous fuels reduction projects in I&D areas. The bill also established new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat. The impact of these new CEs on project planning and forest management goals is uncertain. The 2018 Farm Bill CE allows for larger projects up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres, aiming to achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently. A Government Accountability Office report found that using a CE for environmental review can expedite project planning and implementation, improving agency efficiency. However, concerns exist about conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews or implementing projects of larger areas through CEs. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established under Section 202 of the FY2018 omnibus, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and is for hazardous fuel reduction projects in designated areas on NFS lands. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. New roads are not allowed, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Maintenance of existing roads is permitted. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established under Section 202 of the FY2018 omnibus, allows for hazardous fuel reduction projects in designated areas on NFS lands. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements. New roads are not permitted, and existing roads may be maintained as needed. Projects located within the WUI are prioritized, but those outside the WUI must be in specified fire regime condition classes with high wildfire hazard potential. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report on the use of CEs to congressional committees and GAO. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 under this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in areas with high wildfire hazard potential, especially those within the WUI. It is limited to hazardous fuels reduction projects on NFS lands and requires evaluation of extraordinary circumstances. In contrast, the Farm Bill CE is broader, covering insect and disease infestation projects as well. Both CEs require assessment for extraordinary circumstances that may preclude their use. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of a CE for specified projects on NFS and BLM lands. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to establish a CE for projects on BLM lands to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Projects must be consistent with resource management plans and comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336. Specific activities include removing nonnative vegetation and managing vegetation with livestock grazing. Projects are not allowed in designated wilderness areas and must not include new permanent roads. Temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. The CE for projects on BLM lands aims to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Projects must adhere to resource management plans and DOI Secretarial Order 3336, with activities like removing nonnative vegetation and managing vegetation with livestock grazing. Projects are limited to 4,500 acres and cannot occur in designated wilderness areas. Temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. The law directs agencies to consider landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and habitat restoration, with a 20-year monitoring plan required before using the CE. The Endangered Species Act focuses on conserving endangered species and ecosystems, primarily administered by FWS for terrestrial and freshwater species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is primarily administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for terrestrial and freshwater species, and by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for certain marine species. The ESA allows for the listing of endangered or threatened species, with prohibitions in place once a species is listed. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure their actions do not harm listed species or their critical habitat, known as a Section 7 consultation. This consultation is not required for actions dictated by statute. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to avoid harm to listed species or critical habitat. Consultation is not required for statutory actions. If an action may harm a species or habitat, a biological opinion is issued with terms to avoid harm. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans, specifically stating that updating or revising a forest plan on NFS, O&C, or CBWR lands does not require consultation unless the plan is over 15 years old and 5 years have passed since a species listing or critical habitat designation. This controversial change was seen as necessary to override a Ninth Circuit Court decision regarding re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat designation for the Canada lynx. Supporters argue that this change provides flexibility and consistency in plan implementation. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans, allowing for more flexibility and consistency in plan implementation. The exceptions in the law would permit changes to plans after a certain time, reflecting changes to listed species and critical habitat. Critics argue that not allowing for consultation due to changes in species listing could harm species and their habitat. Proponents argue that projects under a plan still require consultation, making plan consultation redundant. However, critics believe plans address projects at a higher level and could impact the cumulative effect of all projects under the plan. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill changed how Congress appropriates funding for wildfire suppression, added requirements for wildfire risk mapping, and altered aspects of FS and DOI's hazardous fuel reduction programs. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for DOI is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four. Overall, funding for wildland fire management is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Suppression Operations program within FS's and DOI's Wildland Fire Management account covers firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, incident support, and post-wildfire response. If suppression funding runs out, funds can be transferred from other accounts. Appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, mainly due to rising suppression costs. FS and DOI often require more funds than allocated, leading to challenges in funding wildfire response activities. The discrepancy in wildfire suppression funds often leads to fire borrowing, raising concerns about the impact on other agency programs. Congress has enacted supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts. The 115th Congress established the wildfire funding fix in the FY2018 omnibus to address this issue. Discretionary spending, including wildfire spending, is subject to budgetary controls, but Congress has sometimes waived these controls for wildfire spending. The FY2018 omnibus amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, exempting it from discretionary spending limits. This adjustment covers emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, emergency management activities, and necessary funds for repayment of costs. The new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations exempts funding above the FY2015 baseline from discretionary spending limits. The adjustment is capped at $2.95 billion in FY2027, with incremental increases each year. Congress can appropriate additional funds for wildfire suppression operations outside of the discretionary limits, up to the specified maximum. The wildfire funding fix allows for up to $3.64 billion in total appropriations in FY2020, exempt from discretionary limits. This removes budget process barriers for additional wildfire suppression funds in FY2020 and FY2021, with uncertainty beyond FY2021. Congress may need to decide on fire borrowing authority once the wildfire adjustment takes effect in FY2020. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 requires prompt submission of a request for supplemental appropriations if wildfire suppression funds are estimated to be exhausted within 30 days. Concerns for Congress include accountability, oversight, and lack of inflationary factors in the funding fix. This temporary procedural change does not address long-term funding issues beyond FY2021. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to help with strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. Approximately 226 million acres in the US are classified as high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land. The Wildfire Hazard Potential index helps assess the risk of extreme fire behavior in certain weather conditions. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use. Reports on wildland fire management are required by both the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The omnibus bill requires an annual report within 90 days after using the wildfire funding fix, with detailed components and analysis of wildland fire management spending. The report must be prepared by the Secretaries in consultation with the OMB Director, submitted to specific House and Senate Committees, and include risk-based factors influencing suppression decisions and lessons learned from large fires. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land to be submitted to Congress annually. The report includes details on acres treated, fire risk levels, wildfire impact, federal response time, timber production, and more. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbances like wildfires, insect infestations, and windstorms. This includes thinning trees to reduce density, prescribed fires to manage vegetation, and improve post-fire recovery. The authority for these projects comes primarily from FLPMA for BLM and FS. BLM and FS derive authority for restoration projects from various acts and programs established by Congress. This includes managing national forests for multiple use, maintaining forest conditions, and collaborating with stakeholders to identify restoration needs. The 115th Congress established new programs for FS and amended existing ones to support forest restoration efforts. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through collaboration with various stakeholders. The program aims to accelerate forest restoration, mitigate insect infestations, reduce wildfire risks, support local industries, and promote collaboration, although some concerns have been raised about specific aspects of the program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through collaboration with stakeholders. Proposals must be transparent, inclusive, and based on the best available science. They should focus on restoring old-growth stands, reducing hazardous fuels, and not establishing new permanent roads. Annual and 5-year reports are required, with up to 10 proposals funded per fiscal year. The CFLRP authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with a funding commitment of up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years. The program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019 and is perceived as successful in achieving land management objectives and contributing to local economies. The CFLRP program provides dedicated funding for up to 10 projects annually, with a commitment of $4 million per year for up to 10 years. While the program has economic benefits and improves relationships with stakeholders, some feel it falls short in creating new markets for wood products and reducing treatment costs. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023, allowing for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for an additional 10 years. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. This program, initially a pilot in Colorado in 2001, was later made available nationwide for all NFS and BLM lands. States can treat trees, reduce fuels, and improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health under approved GNAs. If reauthorized, more projects could be funded beyond FY2019. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. Activities include fish and wildlife improvement projects, timber removal, and tree planting. Treatments are prohibited in designated wilderness areas. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws. Master Agreements (MAs) outline the general scope of the GNA, while Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs) detail specific terms for project implementation. The good neighbor authority (GNA) allows for specific project types on national forests, such as timber production, wildlife management, and hazardous fuels management. It has been successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and leveraging state resources, but some states have concerns about future sustainability. Changes enacted in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded the authority to include road construction activities and federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments. The farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments. This may lead to increased cross-boundary restoration work and leveraging of nonfederal resources. However, it could also increase administrative demands on agencies like the FS or BLM. Concerns include the distribution of receipts from timber sales and whether revenue-sharing with county governments should be implemented. Stewardship contracting, established as a pilot program in 1999 and made permanent in the 2014 farm bill, allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals. This includes combining timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs and achieve objectives like improving forest health and water quality. Stewardship contracting, established in 1999 and made permanent in the 2014 farm bill, allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals such as soil productivity, watershed restoration, fish and wildlife maintenance, and native plant reestablishment. Excess timber sale revenue can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other projects without further appropriation. Contracts are awarded based on best value, considering past performance and proposal quality, with procurement preference for innovative wood product use. Annual reports on contract development and accomplishments are required. Stakeholders generally view stewardship contracting favorably, citing increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits like local economic activity and new markets for woody biomass. Some concerns exist regarding the development of new markets for woody biomass and restoration by-products, including the potential incentive to remove ecologically important trees for funding service work. Issues also arise with the distribution of receipts from stewardship contracts and the upfront financial obligations required. Despite initial challenges with contract integration and record-keeping, agencies have improved processes and increased contract offerings annually. However, a 2015 USDA Office of Inspector General report identified issues with contract administration and record-keeping related to stewardship. The OIG report identified issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. New guidance was published in 2016 in response to the findings. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in specific fire regime areas. The law also allowed a procurement preference for innovative forest product use and included cancellation ceilings in contracts. Excess revenues can be used to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required. The cancellation ceiling provision allows FS and BLM to obligate funds for cancellation ceilings in stages, rather than up-front. This can resolve concerns about financial obligations and allow for the use of excess revenue to offset costs. 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference may increase market certainty for forest products industries. OMB identified inadequacies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report. The 2006 assessment report identified deficiencies in FS's watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national prioritization. FS committed to improving with long-term performance measures, better data generation, and prioritizing watershed management. The Watershed Condition Framework was developed to classify and prioritize watersheds, leading to restoration action plans and project implementation. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report found shortcomings in FS's management of the program, citing inadequate coordination and oversight. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework program, assigning responsibilities for monitoring project costs and performance towards watershed restoration. The law allows the Forest Service to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners. An emergency designation process is also authorized for prioritizing watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing for cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement. This includes improving fish, wildlife, and other resources on NFS lands within the watershed. The federal government may share costs with nonfederal partners if in the public interest. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing for cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement. This authorizes FS to enter into multi-year water source investment partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds that serve as sources of municipal water. FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to carry out forest management activities for municipal water supply protection and forest health restoration. The law allows FS to conduct a single environmental analysis for the development of the water source management plan or each project proposed. FS can accept cash, in-kind donations, and services from partners to implement the plan, with a Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations. Congress authorized $10 million in annual appropriations to the Fund through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill authorized $10 million annually to the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023. Provisions in the bill included designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and expanding wilderness areas in Tennessee. The Upper Bald River Wilderness was established on the Cherokee National Forest, with additions to existing wilderness areas totaling over 10,500 acres. These areas are to be managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions for managing federal lands in accordance with the Wilderness Act. Commercial activities, motorized access, and certain other activities are prohibited in designated areas. The provisions include new programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites and reauthorizing programs for selling or exchanging BLM lands. The Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program was also reauthorized. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions for managing federal lands in accordance with the Wilderness Act. The program allows for the sale or exchange of undeveloped parcels of NFS land. The bill also modified the Small Tracts Act, expanding eligibility requirements. Additionally, the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are authorized to issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands for various purposes, including water infrastructure and transportation systems. The Federal government charges cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications for infrastructure projects on public lands. Fees are based on estimated hours for processing and monitoring, with separate schedules for linear rights-of-way and communication sites. The 115th Congress directed the Forest Service to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations. The 115th Congress directed the Forest Service to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites and established a pilot process for activities within utility rights-of-way. Concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity transmission and distribution rights-of-way were addressed, with some attributing power line ignitions to weather conditions and vegetation contact. The provisions aim to improve approval processes for rights-of-way permit holders. Some provisions aim to improve approval processes for rights-of-way permit holders on federal lands, with concerns about wildfire suppression costs and liability for wildfires ignited within rights-of-way. Critics worry about the balance between expediting project implementation and accountability. Others believe limiting damages and liability will incentivize prompt agency action on maintenance requests. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands. The new regulations aim to streamline the process, ensure competitive neutrality, and establish a fee structure based on processing costs. Additionally, a new Treasury account was created for managing communication sites. The FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish new guidelines for vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance on federal land with electric transmission facilities. The law requires FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing these activities within ROWs, with specific requirements for plan approval and modification by eligible permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval by the appropriate Secretary and conduct activities within their ROW. The FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish guidelines for vegetation management on federal land with electric transmission facilities. Owners can develop plans for approval by the Secretary and conduct activities within their ROW. The law also addresses circumstances when owners can conduct management activities without approval. FS and BLM are directed to identify NEPA categorical exclusions and develop training programs. The law specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land. Participants can develop vegetation management plans, perform projects within their ROWs, and adhere to fire prevention regulations. The law also addresses liability clauses for ROW holders exceeding $500,000 under certain conditions. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of these clauses to Congress within four years of enactment. The pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land requires participants to cover project costs, with potential FS funding. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire costs if caused by their operations, with a reimbursement limit of $500,000 in certain cases. The law also mandates FS to report program status to Congress biennially. The FY2018 omnibus program for electricity ROWs differs from the ROW pilot program on NFS lands. The FS pilot program under the 2018 farm bill includes electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on revenue. SRS offers optional payment system based on historic revenue, land acreage, and per capita income. Title II and Title III payments under the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program were designated for specific county programs and projects on lands under jurisdiction. Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) were established to provide advice and recommendations to agencies, with members representing various interests. The authorized payment level was set at 95% of the previous year's payment level, and the program was extended multiple times until FY2015. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program authorized payments for counties, with the last payment disbursed in FY2016. Counties received a revenue-sharing payment in FY2017, but the FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018. The reauthorization set the FY2017 payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment and expanded the uses for Title III funds. Payments were made in two installments, with the reauthorization expiring at the end of FY2018. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute, including modifying RAC membership requirements and establishing a pilot program for RAC member appointments in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows agreements between the Secretary of Agriculture and federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary to enter into self-determination contracts with federally recognized tribes for TFPA functions on NFS land, in accordance with the ISDEAA. The Secretary of Agriculture shall carry out all responsibilities delegated to the Secretary of the Interior for such contracts. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary to enter into self-determination contracts with tribes for TFPA functions on NFS land. Congress may consider oversight of the agencies' implementation of the new laws and implications of changes in federal forest management. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres at high fire risk or insect infestation, with a backlog of treatment needs that could take up to 29 years to address. To address concerns, FS has proposed increasing the scale and scope of forest management projects and restoration treatments. The Forest Service faces administrative barriers, including decision-making processes and funding issues, hindering the implementation of forest management and restoration projects. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies by expediting planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction. Expediting planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration is a key goal. Some stakeholders believe that expanding the use of Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions would help achieve progress towards restoration goals. However, concerns exist about changes to decision-making processes and potential environmental impacts. These issues have been ongoing for decades, with challenges raised since the wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. The National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended federal land management agencies invest more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. Recommendations have been made since 1995 to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop strategies to address forest health issues and mitigate wildfire risk. Concerns have been raised about the implementation of hazardous fuels reduction projects by the Forest Service, with ongoing issues in prioritizing, tracking, and reporting. Congress has also evaluated challenges impeding the implementation of fuel management projects. The Forest Service has faced challenges in implementing fuel management projects, with a significant percentage of decisions being appealed. Academic studies suggest that complex projects are more likely to be challenged. Despite efforts to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects, the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to increase. This raises questions about the effectiveness of the HFRA approach to streamline decision-making. The Forest Service has struggled with implementing fuel management projects, leading to a high rate of appeals. Academic studies indicate that complex projects are more prone to challenges. Despite attempts to speed up hazardous fuels reduction projects, the demand for treatment in NFS areas is rising, questioning the effectiveness of the HFRA approach to streamline decision-making. The HFRA approach may need broader application, as seen in legislation from the 115th Congress. Comparisons of forest-related provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill to prior laws are provided in tables, excluding provisions not directly impacting forest management."
