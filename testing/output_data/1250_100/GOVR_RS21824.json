    "content": "During the debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Representative Souder highlighted the increasing drug abuse epidemic and proposed a provision to eliminate student eligibility for financial aid for those convicted of drug crimes. This provision was ultimately added to P.L. 105-244, stating that students convicted of drug offenses would be ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility for federal student aid under Title IV of the HEA due to drug convictions depends on the type of conviction, recency, and number of prior convictions. Indefinite ineligibility occurs with multiple possession or selling convictions. Reinstatement of eligibility requires completion of a drug rehabilitation program or removal of the conviction from the record. Ineligibility periods for possession and sale offenses vary based on the number of convictions. According to the 2006-2007 Federal Student Aid Handbook, a student with a second drug offense is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance. To regain eligibility, the student must complete a drug rehabilitation program that meets specific requirements, including receiving funds from government programs or licensed entities and undergoing at least two unannounced drug tests. Since the 2006-2007 Federal Student Aid Handbook, students with multiple drug offenses face indefinite ineligibility for federal financial aid. To regain eligibility, they must complete a rehabilitation program and undergo at least two unannounced drug tests. Over 180,000 students have been denied aid due to this provision, representing less than .25% of all applicants. California and Texas have seen a high number of students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 changed the implementation of a provision that disqualifies students from federal aid for drug convictions. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and recency of the conviction. Legislative proposals are being considered to modify this provision in the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the HEA. Issues continue to arise regarding how the provision should be applied. During the reauthorization discussions, issues have arisen on how to implement the provision disqualifying students from federal aid for drug convictions. Critics argue that singling out drugs is unfair compared to other crimes like rape or robbery. Supporter maintain that drug-related crimes on college campuses justify the provision. The provision disqualifying students from federal aid for drug convictions is debated during reauthorization. Critics argue singling out drugs is unfair compared to other crimes. Supporters justify the focus on drug-related crimes on college campuses. The existing provision does not distinguish between misdemeanor or felony drug convictions, resulting in loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Congress may debate the difference between felony and misdemeanor drug convictions in relation to student aid eligibility."
