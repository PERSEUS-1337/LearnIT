    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20% of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs. Investing in physical activity could significantly reduce medical expenses, and offering financial incentives could encourage more Americans to be active. The US ranks poorly in preventing obesity-related deaths, highlighting the importance of promoting physical activity from a young age. The Act aims to promote health and prevent diseases related to obesity by encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing financial incentives, and increasing access to physical fitness activities for children to develop lifelong healthy behaviors. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified sports and fitness expenses as amounts paid for medical care. This includes membership at a fitness facility, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for physical activity. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now allows for qualified sports and fitness expenses as part of medical care deductions. The total amount for an individual is capped at $1,000, or $2,000 for joint filers or heads of households. A fitness facility is defined as a place that offers physical exercise programs and facilities for physical fitness, excluding private clubs and facilities for golf, hunting, sailing, or riding. The text chunk discusses the criteria for qualified sports and fitness expenses, including the compliance with state and federal anti-discrimination laws, treatment of exercise materials as instruction, and limitations on equipment expenses for physical activity programs. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, regarding qualified sports and fitness expenses, including limitations on equipment expenses for physical activity programs."
