    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex Expansion and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of the western basin of Lake Erie as the largest freshwater ecosystem in the world, vital to the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made over the past 30 years to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes, with a shift towards a holistic ecosystem approach. The Great Lakes hold over 90 percent of the US surface freshwater, with Lake Erie's western basin receiving significant attention. The western basin of Lake Erie receives 90 percent of its flow from the Detroit River and supports diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants. The coastal wetlands of Lake Erie have the largest diversity of species in the Great Lakes. Over 300 plant species, including 37 significant species, have been identified in the western basin. The shallow western basin is home to the greatest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie. The wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie, including Mouille, Metzger, and Magee marshes, Maumee Bay wetland complex, Locust Point wetland complexes, and Sandusky Bay wetland, provide important habitat for various bird species during migration, nesting, and feeding. The area is a major stopover for diving ducks and sea ducks, indicating its international importance. Lake Erie is known for fishing, boating, birding, and tourism, generating billions in retail sales and jobs. The western basin is a key area for walleye fishing, supporting a significant sport fishing industry in Ohio. The coastal wetlands in the basin have faced pressure for 150 years, once part of a larger marsh and swamp system. The Great Black Swamp has significantly decreased in size over the years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today. Coastal wetlands along the Michigan shoreline have also been reduced by 62 percent. The development of Monroe, Michigan has had a major impact on the wetlands at the mouth of the Raisin River, leaving only about 100 hectares unaltered. The quality of remaining wetlands has been degraded by various stressors. Protective peninsula beach systems like Bay Point and Woodtick near the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay have eroded, worsening shoreline erosion and harming breeding grounds. The purpose of the erosion of protective peninsula beach systems like Bay Point and Woodtick near the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay is to worsen shoreline erosion and harm breeding grounds. The Act aims to establish a national wildlife refuge complex in Ohio to protect and enhance habitats in the western basin, promote partnerships for conservation efforts, and advance collective goals and priorities. The Act aims to establish a national wildlife refuge complex in Ohio to protect and enhance habitats in the western basin, promote partnerships for conservation efforts, and advance collective goals and priorities from the Great Lakes Strategy 2002 report. These goals include cooperating to protect and restore the integrity of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include Cedar Point Refuge, International Refuge, Ottawa Refuge, Refuge Complex, Secretary, and Western basin. The western basin of Lake Erie includes the land and water in the watersheds extending from Lower Detroit River in Michigan to Sandusky Bay in Ohio, including the Bass Island archipelago. West Sister Island Refuge refers to the West Sister Island National Wildlife Refuge established in 1937. The National Wildlife Refuge Complex is established in the western basin of Lake Erie, including the Bass Island archipelago and West Sister Island Refuge. The national wildlife refuge complex in Ohio includes the Ottawa Refuge, West Sister Island Refuge, and Cedar Point Refuge. The Ottawa Refuge boundaries will be expanded to include surrounding land and water from Maumee Bay State Park to the Darby Unit. The Secretary has the authority to make boundary revisions as deemed appropriate. The Secretary has the authority to adjust the boundaries of the Refuge Complex to facilitate property acquisition and implementation of the Act. The Secretary can acquire land, water, and interests within the boundaries through donation, purchase, or exchange with consent from the owner. Federal properties within the Complex can be transferred to the Secretary for the Act's purpose with the administering agency's approval. The Secretary, through the Fish and Wildlife Service Director, will conduct a study on fish and wildlife habitat in dredge spoil disposal sites near Toledo Harbor. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will expand the southern boundary of the International Refuge in Michigan to include additional land and water east of Interstate Route 75, from Sterling State Park to the Ohio State line. The Secretary will administer federally owned land within the Refuge Complex in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 and this Act. Additional statutory authority may be used for conservation and recreation. Priority uses include hunting, trapping, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with Ohio or Michigan for managing non-federal land within the Refuge Complex. The Secretary will encourage Ohio to use greenway authority for funding trails in the Complex. Authorization of appropriations for acquiring land, water, conducting studies, and developing, operating, and maintaining the Refuge Complex."
