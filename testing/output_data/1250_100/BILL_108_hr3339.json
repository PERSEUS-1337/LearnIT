    "content": "The Act titled \"National Defense Energy Savings Act of 2003\" allows for Energy Savings Performance Contracts. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to enter into energy savings performance contracts to achieve energy savings and related benefits. These contracts can last up to 25 years and do not need to include funding for cancellation charges if certain conditions are met. An energy savings performance contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulation requires the contractor to cover costs for energy-saving measures and share in resulting savings. It also mandates an annual energy audit and outlines Government payments and performance guarantees. The performance guarantee in an energy savings performance contract states that either the Government or the contractor is responsible for maintenance and repair services for energy-related equipment. Annual contract payments are limited to the amount the Department of Defense would have paid for energy, operations, and maintenance without the contract. Final rules will be issued to establish procedures and methods for use by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense will establish procedures and methods for selecting, monitoring, and terminating energy savings performance contracts in a cost-effective manner. The Secretary will determine inconsistent regulations and formulate substitute regulations. The procedures will include calculating energy savings and requesting qualifications from firms providing energy savings services. The Secretary can presume contractor qualifications based on past contracts with the Federal Government or listing by a Federal agency. A list of qualified firms for energy savings services will be updated annually. The Secretary can select firms from this list for discussions on proposed projects and choose the most qualified firm for the project. The Secretary can select qualified firms for energy savings services based on past contracts or listing by a Federal agency. The firm can submit unsolicited proposals for energy savings performance contracting services, and facility managers must invite other qualified firms to compete. The Secretary can enter into energy savings performance contracts with qualified firms and review decisions on firm qualifications. The Secretary may enter into energy savings performance contracts under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, with the ability to modify contracts as needed. Additionally, a pilot program allows for up to 10 contracts for energy savings in nonbuilding applications. The Secretary will select contract projects to demonstrate energy savings performance contracting benefits in non-building applications. A report on the pilot program's progress and results must be submitted to Congress within three years, including project descriptions, energy and cost savings, and recommendations for program extension. Energy savings are defined as cost reduction from energy usage in federally owned buildings or facilities resulting from equipment lease or purchase. The term \"energy savings performance contract\" refers to a contract for services related to energy conservation measures at one or more locations, including design, acquisition, installation, testing, operation, and maintenance. This excludes cogeneration processes for non-federally owned buildings. The term \"nonbuilding application\" refers to vehicles, devices, or equipment that consume energy for transportability or maintaining a controlled environment. Secondary savings are additional energy or cost savings resulting from energy efficiency improvements financed and implemented. Secondary savings from energy efficiency improvements under an energy savings performance contract may include reduced fuel delivery needs, personnel cost savings, and environmental benefits. For electric generation equipment, secondary savings may also include increased efficiency in electricity production and revenue from electricity sales to the Federal Government."
