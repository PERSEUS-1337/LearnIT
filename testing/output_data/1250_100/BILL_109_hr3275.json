The findings of Congress highlight the Army's tasks of homeland defense, deterring aggression, and conducting military operations in multiple regions. General Richard Myers emphasizes the need for the Army to win decisively in one theater. Despite efforts to reduce demands on ground forces, recent experiences in Iraq show the importance of having sufficient troops for post-conflict missions. The ongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere are unsustainable for the long term and strain the US military's ability to execute the National Military Strategy. Despite the heavy burden, the nation must continue to engage in world affairs to defend its interests and support the defenseless. The Army, with approximately 499,000 active duty troops, is backed up by nearly 700,000 members of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. The Army, with approximately 499,000 active duty troops, is backed up by nearly 700,000 members of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. This number is a third less than the force level during the first Persian Gulf War in 1991. Around 150,000 troops are in Iraq, 10,000 in Afghanistan, 1,700 in Kosovo, and 37,000 on the Korean peninsula. The Army is stretched thin due to the high operational demands post-9/11, with a former Deputy Chief of Staff stating that the Army is too small for its current missions. The Army, with around 499,000 active duty troops, is facing challenges due to high operational demands post-9/11. A division commander warned that the force could be significantly damaged or even broken in the next five years. The Army Reserve is also at risk of being unable to meet missions abroad or domestically, rapidly degenerating into a 'broken force'. The Chief of the United States Army Reserve expressed deep concern about the overuse of troops, impacting the Army's ability to complete missions and affecting homeland security operations. The strain on first responders who are also National Guard or Reserve members is unacceptable, especially in securing infrastructure against terrorism. Increasing the Army's end-strength by 100,000 troops for fiscal year 2004 is necessary to meet the country's interests and obligations. An increase in the authorized end-strength for the Army by 80,000 troops is necessary to address current operational constraints and future mission requirements. This will provide a long-term solution to personnel problems and enable the Army to engage in stabilization operations like Iraq while maintaining optimal troop rotation schedules. Testimony by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, to the House Armed Services Committee. SEC. 3. INCREASE IN END-STRENGTH FOR THE ARMY. The number of members of the Army at the end of each fiscal year shall be increased as follows: 522,400 for fiscal year 2006, 542,400 for fiscal year 2007, 562,400 for fiscal year 2008, 582,400 for fiscal year 2009, and 582,400 for any fiscal year after 2009."
