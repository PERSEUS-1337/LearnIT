    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged, initially called \"swine flu\" due to its genetic makeup. The virus is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses, with origins in pigs. This new combination had not been seen before in humans or swine. The virus is now spreading from human to human, and the role of swine in its emergence is being investigated by the World Health Organization. The H1N1 virus, also known as Influenza A(H1N1), emerged in April 2009 and is a combination of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. It is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza. The virus has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic, but researchers are unsure of its full virulence. Cases were initially reported in California and Texas, with Mexico also experiencing a new strain of influenza. Public health measures were implemented in Mexico to control the spread of the virus. In April 2009, WHO raised the influenza pandemic alert level to Phase 5, indicating human-to-human spread of the virus in multiple countries. By June 2009, the alert level was raised to Phase 6, the highest level, with warnings of the virus potentially becoming more severe. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 human cases of H1N1 in 80 countries with 231 deaths. The virus spread reflected disease spread, not increased virulence. WHO advised against travel restrictions as they would not stop the virus but could disrupt global community. Ill individuals should delay international travel. Most H1N1 cases showed flu-like symptoms. The strain of H1N1 circulating globally is a new virus causing influenza-like symptoms. Antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in treating H1N1. WHO has a stockpile of oseltamivir for distribution to developing countries in need. There is no vaccine available for the current strain of H1N1. Currently, there is no available vaccine for the H1N1 strain, but efforts are being made by organizations like CDC and WHO to develop one. It may take five to six months to mass-produce a vaccine once the strain is modified. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution. Most countries are following WHO recommendations against travel bans, except for China, which has quarantined Mexican nationals. Mexico responded by halting flights to China until discrimination concerns were addressed. On April 27, 2009, the European Union Health Commissioner urged Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico, but later downgraded the recommendation to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, citing that the virus strain was already present throughout the United States. Closing borders could pose legal and logistical challenges. Several countries have taken measures to prevent the spread of H1N1, such as installing thermal scanners in airports and banning the import of pork products. The USAID has established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian response efforts, providing over $16 million in aid to Latin America and the Caribbean for H1N1 outbreaks. U.S. aid for H1N1 outbreaks focuses on preparedness efforts since the SARS outbreak in 2003. CDC and USAID lead global response efforts, with support from the Department of Defense. USAID donated PPE kits and disinfectant to Vietnam for rapid response to avian or H1N1 influenza outbreaks. CDC, as a WHO collaborating center, plays a key role in detecting and responding to H1N1 outbreaks. CDC plays a key role in detecting and responding to influenza outbreaks globally. They provide testing kits to public health laboratories worldwide at no cost and send experts to help strengthen laboratory capacity in affected countries. HHS Secretary announced the distribution of treatment courses to Mexico and Latin America. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in various fields to assist in controlling the spread of the virus. The Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, along with a trilateral team of experts from Mexico, Canada, and the US, are working to understand H1N1 severity and transmission patterns. CDC collaborates with ECDC and China CDC, supports pandemic preparedness in over 50 countries, and provides funding and experts to assist WHO and foreign ministries of health. USAID has allocated $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with a focus on disease surveillance and control in Latin America and the Caribbean. USAID allocated $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with funds directed to Mexico, Panama, and the region. Assistance includes support for animal surveillance efforts and distribution of personal protection equipment kits. USAID also pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries in preparation for a possible influenza pandemic. Additionally, USAID held a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia involving stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. During a pandemic preparedness exercise, participants tested their plans, identified weaknesses, and improved preparedness. The exercises help governments prepare for influenza outbreaks and address cross-border population movements. USAID plans to conduct similar exercises in South Africa and Asia. They are also working with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries in Africa and Asia. In May 2009, USAID conducted a joint pandemic preparedness exercise with military representatives from 27 African and Asian countries. Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic preparedness since FY2005. The U.S. has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, making it the largest single donor in this area. The funds have supported international efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness and communication. The $949 million provided by the U.S. for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts focused on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The funds supported bilateral activities, international organizations like WHO and UNICEF, regional programs, global contingency, technical assistance, research, and stockpiles. The U.S. provided $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, including funds for H5N1 analysis, non-pharmaceutical supplies, global communications, and outreach. Contributions came from USAID, HHS, USDA, DOD, and DOS. President Obama requested an additional $1.5 billion for pandemic preparedness. The bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with recent outbreaks like H5N1 and SARS raising concerns. The emergence of H1N1 highlights the threat of infectious diseases, with 75% originating from animals. A multidisciplinary approach involving various sectors is needed to address this growing threat. The global response to H1N1 has seen progress in developing tests and treatments, but concerns remain about monitoring in poorer countries and the potential for virus mutation. Winter months could accelerate transmission, especially in countries also dealing with H5N1 outbreaks. Questions persist about the virus's ability to change and the need for continued vigilance. In May 2009, there was debate about WHO's pandemic influenza phase system, with some arguing for severity-based alerts. Critics warned of panic and disruptions if the threat level was raised to Phase 6. Despite concerns, WHO raised the level to 6 on June 11, 2009, emphasizing that it did not indicate increased severity. WHO also updated its pandemic influenza preparedness guide. The update redefined pandemic phases based on observable phenomena and outlined government steps for epidemic planning. USAID launched a program with CDC and USDA to establish a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin infecting humans. Concerns were raised about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries confirming H1N1 cases. Africa is the only sub-Saharan country with confirmed H1N1 cases. Surveillance systems in the region are poor, reflecting limited public health capacity. Efforts by CDC, USAID, and other international experts aim to improve laboratory and disease surveillance. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries remains a debated issue. The peak of global H5N1 avian flu outbreaks resurfaced, with concerns about access to vaccines for poorer countries. USAID estimates lack of access to medicines for 30% of the world's population. WHO reports that 90% of global influenza vaccine capacity is in Europe and North America, raising concerns about hoarding by richer countries. Poorer countries rely on donor generosity for treatments and vaccines, with doubts about their capacity to administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO reported that mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns will not be conducted if a vaccine is developed. National authorities are expected to undertake these efforts, but concerns exist about countries with limited capacity for routine vaccinations. Health experts are worried about the potential severity of the circulating H1N1 strain, especially if it mixes with the H5N1 bird flu strain, creating a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. The possibility of an influenza pandemic from H5N1 has been a concern since 2004 when the first human cases were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. In 2003, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in poultry led to the first human cases of the virus. By 2006, H5N1 had spread to 50 countries, affecting both animals and humans. The virus is more deadly than H1N1 but less easily transmissible. Most human deaths from H5N1 have been due to direct contact with infected birds. Indonesia and Cambodia, among six countries with human H5N1 cases in 2008-2009, have not reported H1N1 cases. Experts are monitoring for potential H1N1 outbreaks in countries dealing with H5N1."
