The Spanish government initially blamed the Basque terrorist group ETA for the attacks, despite similarities to Islamic extremist tactics. On the day of the attack, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1530 condemning ETA's alleged role in the bombing. However, evidence pointed towards possible involvement of Islamic extremists, with discoveries of detonators, Quran verses, and links to Al Qaeda. Despite this, the government continued to insist publicly that ETA was responsible until hours before the polls opened on March 14. Spanish police arrested Zougam and other suspects linked to the attacks, sparking outrage among Spaniards over the government's handling of the crisis. Critics accused the government of trying to shift blame to ETA instead of Al Qaeda to maintain popularity. The government suspected the Al Qaeda-linked Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group's involvement in the attacks, also linked to a previous bombing in Casablanca. On April 2, an unexploded bomb was found on railroad tracks between Madrid and Seville. On April 3, seven men suspected of involvement in the Madrid attacks were killed when they blew themselves up after being surrounded by police. The alleged leader of the terrorists, Serhane ben Abdelmajid Farkhet, known as \"the Tunisian,\" was among the dead. The group was found to be involved in drug trafficking and other crimes to finance their activities. Italian police arrested Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, known as \"Mohammed the Egyptian,\" who was a key planner of the attacks. By September 2004, nearly two dozen individuals charged with involvement in the attacks were in police custody. A parliamentary commission started investigating the attacks and the government's response in June 2004. The attacks occurred just before Spain's March 14 parliamentary elections, leading to speculation that they were intended to influence the vote. In February 2004, a public opinion poll showed concerns about terrorism in Spain. The ruling PP party, led by Mariano Rajoy, was expected to win a narrow victory in the upcoming election, despite opposition to their Iraq policy. Polls projected a close race with the PSOE party, with the PP likely losing its absolute majority in parliament. The Socialist Party of Spain (PSOE) won the election with 42.5% of the vote, gaining 164 seats in the Congress of Deputies. The People's Party (PP) received 37.6% of the vote and won 148 seats. The Socialists will need to form a coalition government, possibly with the United Left and regional parties. Voter turnout was 77.2%, higher than in previous elections. The PSOE's victory in the election was attributed to young, first-time voters and public anger towards the government's decisions on Iraq. There was debate on whether Al Qaeda influenced the election or if it showcased Spain's democracy strength. The election results in Spain were influenced by public anger towards the government's decisions on Iraq, with some critics accusing the new government of appeasing terrorists. Administration officials have refrained from directly criticizing the election outcome. Spanish conservatives avoided direct criticism of the election results, concerned about their impact on relations with the new government. Some Spaniards may believe they can opt out of globalization's dangers while benefiting from it, possibly due to historical perceptions of Spain as a secondary player in world affairs. This attitude may be reinforced by a sense that the United States, including the Bush Administration, is ignorant of Spanish concerns. The new Spanish government, led by Zapatero, abruptly withdrew 1,300 troops from Iraq in April 2004, surprising many. President Bush expressed regret and criticized the withdrawal process. Concerns arose about declining European support for the Iraq mission. The new Spanish government, led by Zapatero, prioritizes fighting terrorism through closer cooperation among EU police and intelligence services. While Spain expanded its contribution to ISAF in Afghanistan, it plans to withdraw troops after the elections, raising concerns about its commitment to the global war on terror. The change in government in Spain under Zapatero may impact U.S.-Spanish relations. Unlike Aznar, who forged a close alliance with the U.S., Zapatero has shown a more critical stance towards the Bush administration, suggesting that the Iraq policy was based on lies. He also advocated for pulling out forces from Iraq to enhance peace efforts. Spain's new leader, Zapatero, aims to strengthen ties with EU partners like France and Germany while maintaining relations with the US. Despite potential strain on US-Spanish relations, common interests like fighting terrorism may limit damage. Plans for information sharing on Islamic militants between Spain and the US are in progress. The National Intelligence Reform Act and the 9/11 Recommendations Appropriations Act emphasize closer international cooperation in fighting terrorism, including eliminating terrorist sanctuaries and curtailing financing. The use of U.S. military bases in Spain for future operations may be challenged due to Spain's new leaders' criticisms of U.S. policies. The El Pais newspaper website, along with other sources, reported on various reactions and developments in Spain following the 2004 elections, including the Spanish Socialists leading in polls, politicians rejecting U.S. accusations, plans to withdraw troops, and comments on Iraq by the new Prime Minister Zapatero."
