    "content": "The \"Video Game Rating Act of 1994\" aims to provide parents with information about video games used in homes or public areas. It defines terms like \"video games\" and \"video devices\" and establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission is established as an independent establishment in the executive branch with 5 members appointed by the President, ensuring no more than 3 members are affiliated with any one political party. Members serve until the Commission's termination, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Chairman receives compensation as specified in the Act. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission can appoint an executive director and additional personnel without following civil service laws. The Chairman can determine their compensation, not exceeding level V of the Executive Schedule. The Commission is allowed to procure consultants by contract. The Commission can hire experts or consultants by contract and must publicly announce any such contracts. Funding is authorized for the Commission's duties until December 31, 1996. The Commission will end either on December 31, 1996, or 90 days after notifying the President of adequate voluntary standards for warning about violent or sexually explicit video game content. The Commission has the authority and functions outlined in Section 4. The Commission is tasked with coordinating with the video game industry to develop voluntary standards for informing purchasers about the content of video games, particularly violence and sexually explicit material. After a year, they will evaluate the industry's proposed standards to determine if they adequately warn users. If deemed sufficient, the Commission will enforce these standards. The Commission will submit a report to the President and Congress on the determination of voluntary standards for video games. They may also enforce regulations requiring manufacturers to provide information on violence or sexually explicit content in video games to purchasers and users. Antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the video game industry to create voluntary guidelines for disclosing sex or violence content to consumers. This exemption does not cover actions leading to a boycott."
