    "content": "One of Justice Stevens's lasting legacies is his opinion in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, a landmark decision in administrative law. The case established the legal framework for court deference to federal agencies in interpreting statutes. Despite being frequently cited, it has also caused confusion due to varied application of the two-step Chevron analysis. Justice Stevens worked to clarify the doctrine but may be outside the majority position on its application as he leaves the Court. The Chevron case involved the \"bubble concept\" in the Clean Air Act, where the EPA allowed states to use a plantwide interpretation for emissions calculations. This had a significant impact on administrative law and raised unresolved questions about the Chevron test. The Natural Resources Defense Council challenged the EPA regulation allowing plants to increase emissions from one source as long as there was a corresponding decrease within the same \"bubble.\" The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act. Justice Stevens outlined a two-part test for reviewing agency authority, emphasizing the importance of Congress's intent in interpreting statutes. The Supreme Court's Chevron analysis established a deferential judicial role in reviewing agency interpretations of statutes. If Congress has clearly spoken on an issue, that must be followed, but if not, the court must determine if the agency's interpretation is permissible. If an agency's interpretation goes against Congress's clear intent, it must be rejected. At step two of the Chevron analysis, the court defers to reasonable agency interpretations when Congress's intent is unclear. Justice Stevens found that the EPA's \"plantwide\" regulation was a permissible construction of the Clean Air Act, citing congressional delegation, agency expertise, and political accountability as reasons for deference to agency interpretation. The Chevron doctrine requires courts to defer to agency interpretations in cases of statutory uncertainty, as agencies are delegated policymaking authority by Congress. This deference is justified by the agency's expertise in the relevant field, the complexity of interpretive decisions, and the concept of political accountability. Justice Stevens argued that judges should not substitute their interpretation of an ambiguous statute for that of an agency, as agencies are accountable to the Chief Executive, who represents the people. The Chevron decision, which requires deference to agency interpretations in cases of statutory uncertainty, has been cited in over 11,000 judicial opinions but has led to inconsistencies in its application. This has raised questions about when and how to apply the Chevron analysis, impacting the balance of power between agencies and the courts in interpreting statutes. The Chevron decision, led by Justice Stevens, has governed the balance of power between agencies and courts in interpreting statutes for over 25 years. Despite arguments that its authority has diminished, the opinion is still regularly cited. The Chevron test continues to evolve, with the basic Stevens framework serving as an authority in delineating interpretive roles. Whenever an agency interprets its authorizing statute or a statute it administers, the Chevron framework is triggered. This has played a significant role in cases of alleged agency overreaching in derogation of Congress's will. The Chevron decision, led by Justice Stevens, has governed the balance of power between agencies and courts in interpreting statutes for over 25 years. Despite arguments that its authority has diminished, the opinion is still regularly cited. The Court has shown a decrease in reliance on Chevron as a controlling precedent, with some opinions restricting its potential application. Major questions remain about when and how to properly apply the Chevron test, including the threshold question of what agency interpretations qualify for deference and the tools of statutory construction used in the process. The Chevron test, established over 25 years ago, continues to be a point of contention in the courts. The 2009 Supreme Court case Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc. highlighted the ongoing confusion surrounding the application of the Chevron test, particularly regarding the order of steps and whether legislative intent should be considered. Justice Scalia upheld EPA's interpretation in the case, while Justice Stevens criticized the majority for not first determining if Congress had clearly spoken on the issue. In 2001, the Supreme Court added a new \"step zero\" to the Chevron analysis, limiting deference to certain agency interpretations based on Congress's delegation of authority. Mead Corp. and Christensen v. Harris established that Chevron deference depends on the formality of the agency's process and the extent of delegated authority. Justice Stevens criticized the majority for assuming ambiguity and skipping the first step of determining if Congress had directly spoken on the issue. The Supreme Court's Chevron deference depends on the formality of agency interpretations and the extent of delegated authority. Policy statements and interpretive letters do not warrant Chevron deference, while formal rules and interpretations with the \"force of law\" do. Those interpretations not qualifying for Chevron deference may still receive Skidmore deference, where courts defer to agency interpretations based on persuasiveness. The \"force of law\" standard from Mead is not clearly defined, with additional factors considered for Chevron deference. In Barnhart v. Walton, Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of agency expertise and careful consideration in legal questions. Justice Scalia has criticized the Mead standard, foreseeing ongoing consequences. Justice Stevens advocates for considering legislative history in determining Congress's intent, creating a divide on the Court. In Chevron, Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia have differing views on statutory construction. Stevens considers text, purpose, and legislative history, while Scalia favors a purely textualist approach. The Court seems to lean towards Scalia's position, focusing on textual clarity. Stevens continues to assert his intentionalist stance. The 2007 case Zuni exemplifies their interpretive divide. In the 2007 case Zuni Public School District No. 89 v. Department of Education, the majority upheld the Secretary of Education's interpretation of the Impact Aid Act's \"equalization requirement\" for aid expenditures to public school districts. The case highlighted the interpretive divide between Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia, with the majority ultimately finding the agency's interpretation reasonable due to unclear congressional intent. In Zuni Public School District No. 89 v. Department of Education, the majority upheld the agency's interpretation of the Impact Aid Act's \"equalization requirement\" based on legislative history. Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of legislative history in Chevron analysis, citing the need to use traditional tools of statutory construction to determine Congress's intent. Stevens was willing to defer to evidence of Congress's intent over clear statutory text. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the agency's interpretation was unreasonable. Justice Scalia's dissent in Zuni Public School District No. 89 v. Department of Education focused on the importance of the statutory text over legislative history in Chevron analysis. He criticized the majority's reliance on legislative history and emphasized the need to interpret Congress's intent based on what was enacted. Scalia's dissent highlighted the potential impact of a narrow construction of Chevron deference on agency interpretations. The new Court's approach to the Chevron test will determine the role of legislative history in statutory interpretation. The departure of Justice Stevens could impact the future of the Chevron doctrine, with a shift towards a more textualist approach diminishing the role of legislative history in interpreting congressional delegations to agencies. Despite being widely cited, the proper application of the Chevron test remains unsettled, and its influence on the balance of interpretive roles between courts and administrative agencies will persist."
