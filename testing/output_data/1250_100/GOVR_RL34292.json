    "content": "Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are legal rights granted by governments to encourage innovation and creative output, ensuring creators benefit from their inventions or works. IPR can take forms such as patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, or geographical indications. Governments grant a temporary legal monopoly to innovators, allowing them to control the use of their creations. IPR can be traded or licensed for fees and royalties. The World Trade Organization (WTO) sets minimum standards for IPR protections, enforced on a national basis. The Patent Act governs patents in the United States, granting rights for new products, processes, designs, and plants. Patents grant exclusive rights to inventors for new and non-obvious inventions with industrial applications for 20 years. This temporary monopoly encourages innovation and R&D investment. Patent holders must disclose their invention details to spur further creativity. Patents are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Trade secrets are valuable information that is not generally known and is subject to efforts to maintain its secrecy. Examples include blueprints, customer lists, pricing information, and source code. Unlike patents, trade secret protection does not require an application and lasts as long as the secret remains unknown. Protection is found in both federal and state law, with most states adopting the Uniform Trade Secret Act. In the United States, patents provide stronger protection for innovations but are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Copyrights protect original expressions of authorship, such as books, music, and software, and differ from patents in that they focus on the expression of ideas rather than the ideas themselves. Both patents and copyrights aim to protect investments in creative work to encourage further innovation. Copyright protection in the United States lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years for personal works, or 120 years from creation for corporate works. Trademarks, governed by the Lanham Act of 1946, allow sellers to use distinctive names, marks, symbols, or sounds to identify and market products. Trademarks can convey instant assurance of quality and prevent other companies from free-riding on the association of quality with the trademarked item. Trademarks are important for commanding a premium in the marketplace due to their reputation and distinctiveness. Trademark rights are acquired through use or registration with the PTO. Geographic indications, protected by the Lanham Act, safeguard the quality and reputation of products from specific regions. Infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR) involves misappropriation or violation, such as patent infringement. In the case of patents, infringement involves a third party's unauthorized use of the patented invention. The main challenge for patent rights in international trade is infringement in foreign countries. Copyright infringement occurs when a third party reproduces, performs, or distributes a copyrighted work without consent. Terms like \"piracy\" are used to describe violations of intellectual property rights. The major challenge for copyright protection is piracy through physical duplication, illegal dissemination over the Internet, or unauthorized commercial transactions. Trademark piracy involves using a famous foreign trademark that is not registered or invalid. Counterfeit products are imitations of genuine goods, created to deceive consumers about their origin. They can damage the reputation of the original trademarked product and may pose potential harm to consumers. Counterfeiting is a major challenge for trademarked products, with examples including fake fashionwear and pharmaceutical products. Additionally, counterfeit goods can be sold at a premium, reducing sales of the original items. The imitator uses a confusingly similar trademark to benefit from the reputation of a well-known product. Trade secret theft can occur through cyber means, with criminal activity, including IP theft, increasingly happening in cyberspace. Cybercrime, such as cybertheft, involves using a computer to steal money or valuable information. The curr_chunk discusses fraud, theft of intellectual property, and theft of personal and financial data in relation to innovation and patent applications. The United States, Germany, Japan, and China accounted for over 60% of all 2014 PCT applications, with China showing significant growth. Top fields of technology in PCT filings included computer technology, digital communication, electrical machinery, medical technology, and measurement. Intellectual property is a key driver of U.S. productivity, economic growth, and employment across various industries such as aerospace, automotive, computer, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. Copyright-based industries like software, data processing, and motion pictures also benefit. A 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Commerce found that IP-intensive industries directly supported 27.1 million jobs in the United States in 2010, accounting for about 19% of total U.S. employment. In 2010, IP-intensive industries directly supported 27.1 million U.S. jobs, with wages 42% higher than non-IP-intensive industries. These industries contributed $5 trillion to the U.S. economy, accounting for over one-third of the GDP. IP-related merchandise exports totaled $775 billion, while imports reached $1,336 billion. Key sectors for trade include semiconductor parts, pharmaceuticals, and computer equipment. Services exports by IP-intensive industries were about $90 billion in 2007. The study highlights the role of IP-intensive industries in U.S. trade in services, including royalties and licensing fees. In 2013, U.S. had a trade surplus of $90 billion in royalties and license fees. Industry-specific figures demonstrate the importance of IP in the U.S. economy, such as copyright industries. In 2013, the \"core\" copyright industries contributed $1.1 trillion to the U.S. economy, employing nearly 5.5 million workers. Foreign sales of U.S. copyright sectors totaled $156.3 billion. American biopharmaceutical companies support over 810,000 direct jobs and nearly 3.4 million total jobs, with an economic output of nearly $800 billion annually. Based on a study by NDP Analytics, U.S. manufacturing industries with strong intellectual property (IP) exceeded non-IP-intensive industries in R&D investment, wages, exports, value-added, and gross output per employee from 2000-2012. Advocates argue that the economic benefits of exceptions to exclusive rights, known as \"fair use,\" are not fully considered. Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted works without permission for purposes like news reporting, research, teaching, and library use. Businesses relying on \"fair use\" exceptions to U.S. copyright law generated significant revenue and value-added, with employment and exports also being positively impacted. Globalization and technological advancements have transformed information and trade flows, creating new markets for U.S. exporters but also leading to increased counterfeiting and piracy. Factors contributing to intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement include high costs and time for research and development, contrasted with low costs and risks for infringers. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, face substantial costs and time investments in developing new drugs. In the 2010s, PhRMA member companies spent $51 billion on research and development. Drug counterfeiters use cheap and potentially harmful ingredients to lower production costs. The rise of easily duplicated technologies has increased counterfeiting and piracy. The internet has facilitated the distribution of counterfeit products. The United States is concerned about foreign infringement of U.S. intellectual property rights. Quantifying economic losses from infringement is challenging due to its illicit nature. IPR infringement is difficult to measure due to its secretive nature. Quantifying economic losses from copyright piracy is challenging, as it is easier to measure the positive contribution of copyright industries to the U.S. economy. The economic impact of IPR infringement depends on various factors, including consumer behavior and deterrence to R&D. Calculating data on counterfeiting and piracy involves assumptions that can greatly affect loss estimates. Sales of pirated goods may equate to revenue losses for legitimate U.S. copyright businesses. IPR infringement has shifted to digital mediums, making it harder to measure economic losses accurately. U.S. trade losses from copyright infringement may be underestimated due to unaccounted forms of piracy like Internet piracy. Estimates suggest that around 24% of global Internet traffic involves copyright infringement. Data on economic losses from intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement come from various sources, including academic, policy, and industry sources. The U.S. government lacks systematic data collection on the impacts of counterfeiting and piracy on the economy, relying on estimates from industry groups. Global economic costs of IPR infringement are significant, reaching hundreds of billions of dollars, with increasing adverse effects. Customs data on seizures of counterfeit goods provide insight into the impact on producers and exporters. The global economic costs of intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement are significant, reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. A 2007 OECD study estimated that world trade in counterfeit and pirated goods amounted to $200 billion in 2005, increasing to $250 billion in 2007. The Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP) study projected that the total value of counterfeit and pirated products for G-20 economies could reach $1.22 trillion to $1.77 trillion in 2015. G-20 economies were estimated to lose over $125 billion annually from counterfeiting and piracy due to impacts on trade, foreign investment, employment, and other factors. The study estimated that G-20 economies lost about 2.5 million jobs from counterfeiting and piracy, with up to 2.5 million legitimate jobs potentially created in their absence. U.S. economic losses from IPR infringement are significant, with data from FY2014 showing 23,140 seizures of commodities valued at $1.2 billion at U.S. borders. China and Hong Kong were the top source economies for seizures, with watches/jewelry and handbags/wallets being the most seized items. Customs data may not capture digital-based IPR infringement. U.S. industries lose billions annually due to piracy and counterfeiting, leading to job losses and decreased tax revenues. The total economic losses from international theft of U.S. IP are estimated to be hundreds of billions per year, comparable to total U.S. exports to Asia in 2012. Efforts have been made to quantify losses from IPR infringement in specific economic sectors and countries. The United States is a leading advocate of strong global IPR rules, integrating IPR policy in its international trade activities since the mid-1980s. The World Trade Organization (WTO) plays a central role in the multilateral trading system, established in 1995 to enhance IPR laws and enforcement through trade agreements. A McAfee survey revealed that companies lost an average of $4.6 million worth of IP in 2008 from security breaches, emphasizing the importance of intellectual property to the economy. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 as a result of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. One of the agreements from this round was the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which sets minimum standards for IPR protection and enforcement that all WTO member states must follow. Developing countries initially hesitated to include IPR in trade negotiations but eventually agreed after being granted delayed compliance periods and achieving other negotiating goals. The TRIPS Agreement was the first time intellectual property rules were incorporated into the multilateral trading system. The TRIPS Agreement, part of the WTO, includes national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment for IPR protection. It covers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more. Enforcement standards are outlined, and a Council monitors implementation. Developing countries have transition arrangements. The TRIPS Agreement under the WTO includes national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment for IPR protection, covering patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more. It also provides for dispute resolution through the WTO's mechanism, emphasizing the balance of rights and obligations between private right holders and social and cultural development. The agreement aims to promote technological innovation and technology transfer for the mutual benefit of producers and users, especially in developing countries. The TRIPS Agreement aims to promote technology transfer from developed to developing countries, but the interpretation of this obligation varies. Developed countries are required to provide incentives for technology transfer, while developing countries face challenges in complying with international IPR standards. Developing countries have a longer period to align their laws and enforcement mechanisms with the TRIPS Agreement. The TRIPS Agreement provides extended transition periods for developing and least developed countries to comply with intellectual property rights obligations. Developing countries have additional time to align their laws with the agreement, while least developed countries have been granted multiple extensions, allowing them to delay implementation until July 1, 2021. The Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations launched with a Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health in 2001. It aimed to address developing country concerns by delaying patent system provisions for pharmaceutical products for least developed countries until 2016. The Declaration allowed for flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, including granting compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals in cases of national emergencies like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The WTO members were directed to find a solution for countries with insufficient manufacturing capability to issue compulsory licenses. Compulsory licenses are issued by governments to authorize the use or production of a patented item by a domestic party other than a patent holder, as authorized by Article 31 of TRIPS. The provision restricting production authorized by compulsory license to the domestic market was waived for exports of pharmaceutical products for \"HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other epidemics\" to least developed countries and countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity. This Decision was incorporated as an amendment to the TRIPS agreement at the Hong Kong Ministerial in December 2005. The TRIPS agreement was amended at the Hong Kong Ministerial in December 2005 to allow for compulsory licenses for exporting pharmaceutical products for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The deadline for ratification of the amendment has been extended multiple times, with 57 WTO members having ratified it so far. Only Rwanda has utilized the system to import HIV/AIDS medicines from a Canadian generic manufacturer. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is another venue for addressing intellectual property rights issues. WIPO, a UN agency established in 1970, focuses on global intellectual property protection. It administers IPR treaties, including the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty. Recent efforts have centered on patent law. WIPO's recent efforts have focused on patent law, with the adoption of the Patent Law Treaty in 2000 for harmonization of patent procedures. Discussions for a Substantive Patent Law Treaty began in 2001 but were put on hold in 2006 due to differing views among developed and developing countries. The main focus remains on building a resource base for informed discussions on various patent issues. Additionally, patent law harmonization efforts are also taking place outside of WIPO, such as in the Trilateral Cooperation and IP5 groupings. WIPO's functions include assisting member states through training programs, legislative information, and public awareness activities. President Obama signed the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2015, which sets trade negotiating objectives and expedited procedures for certain trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) sets negotiating objectives for trade agreements, including IPR issues. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 first enacted IPR negotiating objectives, leading to the TRIPS Agreement and IPR provisions in NAFTA. Subsequent FTAs followed this template, focusing on strengthening the IPR trade regime. The Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 continued this trend under the George W. Bush administration. The 2002 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) set significant IPR negotiating objectives for U.S. FTA negotiations, aiming for standards of protection similar to U.S. law. This led to TRIPS-plus provisions, expanding coverage to new sectors and addressing technological innovations. The objective also included applying existing IPR protections to digital media and ensuring enforcement keeps pace with technological change. The May 10, 2007 Bipartisan Trade Agreement established flexibilities for patent protections to promote access to medicines in developing countries while maintaining strong overall IPR protection. Changes were sought in pending U.S. FTAs to ensure flexibility for developing country trading partners to meet IPR obligations and promote access to life-saving medicines. A Bipartisan Trade Agreement between the Bush Administration and the House leadership was reached on May 10, 2007, modifying IPR language in FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia. The U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS) was not modified as South Korea is considered a developed country. Congress passed the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Promotion and Accountability Act (TPA-2015) in June 2015, expanding on IPR negotiating objectives to include digital trade importance and provisions against cybertheft. The objectives aim to further protect IPR through TRIPS Agreement implementation and ensure FTAs reflect U.S. law standards. The U.S. focuses on free trade agreements (FTAs) to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) related to new technologies, eliminate discriminatory treatment, ensure rights holder protection, enforce IPR, prevent government involvement in violations like cybertheft, and promote innovation and access to medicine. This includes provisions against cybertheft and digital trade importance in FTAs to reflect U.S. law standards. The United States focuses on free trade agreements (FTAs) to promote stronger intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes by foreign trading partners. The Obama Administration is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement with several countries to reduce trade barriers, establish rules for trade and investment, and strengthen economic ties. The U.S. seeks to build on existing FTAs and negotiate extensive IPR provisions in the TPP. The United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement to establish trade rules and strengthen economic ties. One contentious issue is the 12-year data exclusivity period for biologic drugs, which has become a source of disagreement among the negotiating parties. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement negotiations involve a debate over the data exclusivity period for biologic drugs. The U.S. law mandates a 12-year exclusivity period, while other TPP countries have shorter periods. The Obama Administration is also in talks with the EU for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), which includes discussions on intellectual property rights (IPR) standards. The T-TIP negotiations between the EU and the US may face challenges in reconciling differences on IPR obligations, particularly regarding geographical indications. The EU seeks strong protection for GIs like Parmesan cheese and Champagne, while the US prefers trademark law for GIs. Balancing IPR protection with public policy goals like access to medicines and trade secrets is a key issue. The ACTA aims to address trade secret theft internationally. The ACTA, a trade agreement involving primarily developed countries, aims to address new IPR issues in the digital environment. Despite not entering into force due to the European Parliament's rejection in 2012, Japan is the only party to have submitted formal approval. The ACTA's patent and copyright commitments are of continued interest in U.S. FTAs, particularly in contentious areas like pharmaceutical patents. Many FTAs include TRIPS-plus patent provisions, such as patent term extensions, regulatory authority linkages, data protection, compulsory licensing, and parallel importation. The U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia address concerns over restricting access to medicines and have less ambitious standards for pharmaceutical patents. The U.S. Trade Representative seeks pharmaceutical IP provisions that promote innovation, generic drug competition, and affordable access to medicines in the TPP. The curr_chunk discusses patent term extensions beyond the 20-year protection, which can lead to increased costs for consumers by delaying the entry of generic drugs. TRIPS requires patent protection terms of 20 years but does not mandate extensions for \"unreasonable\" delays. Many FTAs include provisions for mandatory patent term length extensions. The curr_chunk discusses patent term extensions beyond the TRIPS obligation of 20-year protection, allowing for extensions in cases of \"unreasonable\" delays in patent issuance. FTAs like KORUS define these delays and require expedited processing of patent applications. Patent linkage prevents marketing approval if a patent is valid in a country. Patent linkage, a common requirement in U.S. FTAs like KORUS, restricts marketing approval for generic drugs without patent holder permission. Unlike TRIPS, these agreements tie approval to patent status. Data exclusivity also protects test data, preventing generic companies from using it for approval. Test data protection is essential for gaining marketing approval for generic drugs. It requires generic companies to submit their own safety and efficacy data for regulatory approval. This protection incentivizes innovation but can also increase costs and delay access to generic drugs. U.S. FTAs like KORUS go beyond TRIPS by providing a minimum five-year period of data exclusivity for new chemical products. The KORUS FTA requires a minimum three-year period of data exclusivity for previously approved chemical products, starting from the date of marketing approval. Other FTAs like Colombia, Panama, and Peru maintain five years of data exclusivity for test data on new chemical products, with provisions that may reduce the term by at least six months. Data exclusivity for biologics is a debated topic in trade policy. A compulsory license is an authorization for third parties to manufacture or use a patented product without the rights-holder's permission. TRIPS allows compulsory licenses with compensation to the patent owner, without limiting the situations for issuance. U.S. FTAs with Australia and Singapore restrict compulsory licenses to domestic use, antitrust violations, public non-commercial use, national emergency, or extreme need. KORUS FTA has no specific limitations on compulsory licensing. Developing countries' FTAs do not include compulsory license provisions. Parallel imports, or grey-market goods, involve importing goods into a country without the rights-holder's permission after they were sold elsewhere. This practice is related to the exhaustion of intellectual property rights (IPR) after the first sale. Developing countries see parallel importation as a way to improve access to medicines without compulsory licenses. Pharmaceutical companies are concerned about price differentiation between markets. TRIPS Article 6 excludes IPR exhaustion issues from WTO dispute settlement, allowing members to have different exhaustion regimes. The TRIPS Agreement does not address parallel imports, but U.S. FTAs with certain countries disallow them. Copyright protection measures in U.S. FTAs include TRIPS-plus provisions like extending copyright terms and protecting rights-management information. U.S.-negotiated trade agreements prohibit the removal or alteration of rights-management information. Patent protection policies have shifted in FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia, while copyright protection provisions have remained consistent. In U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia, copyright protection provisions have remained consistent. FTAs require an additional twenty years of copyright protection, extending the minimum term to seventy years from the death of the author. Provisions in the FTAs outlaw circumvention of technological measures protecting copyrighted works, based on the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. ISPs are granted limited immunity from copyright liability if they comply with regulations, such as blocking access to infringing materials. Holdings argue that ISPs must assist in enforcing copyright for laws to be effective, while critics believe this burdens ISPs and limits policy flexibility. Protecting proprietary information is crucial for a company's competitiveness and survival, with trade secrets constituting a significant portion of firms' information value. The international protection of U.S. trade secrets is a growing concern, with reports of increasing theft impacting economic security. Trade secret theft is a growing concern for companies, especially in the digital environment. The United States is increasingly worried about trade secret theft through cybercrime. Penalties for trade secret theft vary among countries, with some having no penalties at all. In the U.S., remedies for trade secret theft are primarily found in state law. The U.S. aims to establish criminal penalties for trade secret theft in international trade agreements. This agenda may involve prohibiting certain practices that unfairly advantage local firms. The Obama Administration's strategy on mitigating the theft of U.S. trade secrets includes seeking new criminal remedy provisions in trade negotiations. U.S. trade policy is focused on addressing evolving issues in international IPR protection and enforcement, especially in the digital environment. The concept of \"indigenous innovation\" is associated with promoting domestic companies' innovation and increasing their value added to the economy. Indigenous innovation policies aim to boost domestic manufacturing and innovation by requiring technology transfer, but concerns arise over discrimination against foreign firms. China's policies have caused trade tensions with the U.S., and similar trends are emerging in countries like India. Localization barriers, such as in-country testing requirements and data localization rules, are hindering market access and innovation in the ITC sector in countries like India. These measures, while sometimes serving data privacy or security goals, can distort trade, discourage foreign investment, and prompt other nations to implement similar restrictions. The curr_chunk discusses localization barriers in trade negotiations, particularly in the digital environment, focusing on issues in the TPP and T-TIP negotiations. Concerns are raised about deteriorating patent protections in various countries, with India and Canada being highlighted. India's recent decisions to deny or revoke patents for certain drugs are also mentioned, including the requirement for \"enhanced efficacy\" for patent approval. Innovator companies often seek patents for modified versions of products, a practice known as \"evergreening.\" India's patent laws aim to prevent evergreening unless there is enhanced efficacy. Some argue that evergreening delays the entry of generic drugs by extending patent monopolies. USTR argues that modifications can bring new benefits. India has issued compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals, such as for Nexavar, citing high prices. Canada's courts have raised concerns about the utility requirement for patents. Canadian courts' recent decisions on the utility requirement for pharmaceutical patents have raised concerns, leading to a NAFTA Chapter 11 investor-state dispute settlement case. U.S. pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly filed a Notice of Arbitration against Canada seeking $500 million in damages for lost sales due to invalidated patents. The so-called \"promise doctrine\" in Canada has invalidated patents for 18 drugs since 2002, causing an estimated revenue loss of $1.1 billion for brand-name pharmaceutical companies. The \"promise doctrine\" in Canadian patent law consists of distinct tests for patent validity, focusing on novelty, non-obviousness, and utility at the time of filing. A Canadian court will assess if a specific level of utility was promised in the patent specification. Some argue that this standard makes it easier for generic companies to challenge patented drugs' usefulness. The USTR has expressed concerns about the lack of clarity and impact of heightened utility requirements for patents in Canada, leading to uncertainty. The Government of Canada responded to accusations regarding its patent system, stating it is consistent with NAFTA and TRIPS. Observers note the lack of a uniform standard for utility among countries. International trade negotiations focus on protecting plant and animal inventions, new plant varieties, traditional knowledge, and folklore. Some indigenous communities and organizations are concerned about patents on traditional knowledge and genetic material, as well as the distribution of benefits from their commercial use. The TRIPS Agreement allows exemptions for certain types of plants and animals from patentability, and the Doha Declaration calls for an examination of the relationship between TRIPS, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and traditional knowledge and folklore. These issues are also being discussed in WIPO. India, Brazil, and Peru advocate for disclosure of genetic material sources before obtaining patents. The US and EU support national systems granting research permission with benefit sharing. Some US FTAs protect plants, animals, and varieties. Recent FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia aim to expand patent coverage for plants and animals. Side-letters in these FTAs address biodiversity and traditional knowledge through the IGC. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is also relevant. The Trade Act of 1974, specifically Section 301, identifies foreign trade barriers related to intellectual property protection. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 strengthened this by introducing \"Special 301\" provisions for an annual review of countries' IP policies. The USTR must identify countries lacking adequate IP protection by April 30th each year, even if they comply with TRIPS commitments. The findings are included in the USTR's annual \"Special 301\" report, categorizing countries based on their IP protection status. Priority Foreign Country: Designated by the USTR for severe intellectual property violations, these countries may face trade sanctions or negotiations to improve their IP protection record. If named, an investigation must be launched, potentially leading to WTO dispute settlement proceedings. The USTR uses various tools like the Priority Watch List, Watch List, Section 306 Monitoring, and Out-of-Cycle Review to monitor countries for intellectual property protection compliance. These tools help identify countries with IP protection inadequacies and track their progress for potential status changes in the Special 301 report. The USTR uses tools like the Priority Watch List, Watch List, Section 306 Monitoring, and Out-of-Cycle Review to monitor countries for intellectual property protection compliance. Placement on the lists is based on factors like IPR infringement, laws enforcement, progress in IPR protection, and commitment to trade agreements. The USTR gathers information from trade barriers reports and consultations with various sources to determine country placement, with no specific criteria or formula for upgrades or downgrades. The Act of 1930 prohibits unfair competition in product imports to the US, including infringement of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and design rights. It is increasingly used for intellectual property rights enforcement. The import or sale of infringing products is illegal without the need to show injury. The US International Trade Commission administers section 337 proceedings. An administrative law judge provides an initial determination to the ITC, which can issue exclusion or cease and desist orders in case of a violation. The ITC may enforce a limited or general exclusion order through CBP to keep out infringing articles. A cease and desist order can also be used to stop the sale of infringing products in the US. The President has the authority to disapprove a remedial order within a 60-day review period for policy reasons, considering public interest criteria and relevant factors. The number of Section 337 cases managed by the ITC has been increasing, with most cases involving patent infringement allegations. Investigations cover various technologies such as smartphones, smart televisions, and semiconductors. Legislative efforts have focused on addressing jurisdictional issues related to foreign websites and piracy, sparking debate on protecting U.S. intellectual property. Congress is debating the balance between protecting U.S. intellectual property and promoting innovation, including the effectiveness of CBP's enforcement of Section 337 exclusion orders. Concerns have been raised about the transparency and efficiency of Section 337. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free entry to certain products from developing countries to foster economic growth. The Trade Act of 1974 authorized the GSP for a ten-year time. The GSP program, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, aims to increase export markets and promote intellectual property protection abroad. It is non-reciprocal and requires countries to fulfill mandatory criteria to be designated as beneficiaries. The program undergoes annual reviews by the GSP Subcommittee, which evaluates countries based on discretionary criteria, including intellectual property rights protection. The USTR is currently reviewing practices in Indonesia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan regarding IPR. Congress has legislative, oversight, and appropriations responsibilities in this area. Congress plays a significant role in intellectual property rights (IPR) and trade policy, with ongoing debates on the impact of IPR on trade negotiations. There is a discussion on the balance between IPR protection/enforcement and other public policy objectives like access to medicines and information flow. The debates surrounding trade policy channels used by the United States to promote IPR goals, including the use of regional and bilateral FTAs, and the implications for multilateral IPR promotion efforts. Congress's role in considering IPR negotiating objectives in agreements like the TPP and T-TIP, and the balance between fostering innovation and access to medicine while ensuring patent protection provisions. In the May 10, 2007 Bipartisan Trade Agreement, Congress may need to review negotiating results for new IPR objectives. The effectiveness of U.S. trade policy tools in ensuring IPR compliance is a concern. The debate includes the balance of Special 301 designations in assessing countries' IPR regimes. Some argue that Special 301 designations should accurately reflect countries' IPR inadequacies, while others believe it is overly industry-driven. The US has been involved in WTO disputes over TRIPS Agreement, but only one case has been filed since 2000. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of current US trade policy in addressing IPR challenges with emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil. Congress may need to evaluate USTR's criteria for initiating cases and consider resources for investigating and bringing additional cases. FTAs and negotiations with emerging economies like China and India are key areas for Congress to consider in advancing U.S. IPR trade policy objectives. The TPP and T-TIP negotiations aim to address trade barriers in third countries, with the potential for other nations to join. Bilateral Investment Treaties are also used to reduce barriers to foreign investment. Congress should assess encouraging emerging economies to join TPP negotiations and strengthening protections for foreign investment through BITs. The U.S. Model BIT treats IPR as a covered form of investment subject to protections. The United States is negotiating BITs with China and India, which would require Senate ratification. Stakeholders suggest using trade preference programs to encourage policy reform in emerging economies. Congress may examine the effectiveness of the WTO TRIPS Agreement with respect to emerging economies. The United States is seeking redress for violations of TRIPS Agreement commitments through the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism with trading partners like China. Stakeholders call for greater trade enforcement action on IPR and potential updates to TRIPS. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of the current U.S. IPR organizational structure in enforcing foreign countries' IPR obligations. Coordination among federal agencies involved in IPR is a key issue. One set of issues revolves around coordination in federal agencies involved in IPR protection and enforcement in the U.S. There are debates on the effectiveness of various interagency bodies related to IPR, with concerns about potential overlap and bureaucracy. Another issue is the allocation of federal resources for IPR protection and enforcement, which is a stated trade policy priority. The United States faces challenges in allocating federal resources for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. Congress lacks specific funding for IPR activities, making it difficult to assess the impact of piracy and counterfeiting. This complicates decision-making on prioritizing IPR enforcement against other government needs. Efforts to enhance interagency coordination may not be effective without increased resources. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. trade policy on IPR to drive innovation and competitiveness in the economy. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. trade policy on intellectual property rights (IPR) by setting negotiating objectives, considering IPR in trade agreements, examining enforcement mechanisms, and balancing IPR with other public policy goals. Congressional debates may focus on issues such as access to affordable medicines and the allocation of budgetary resources for IPR protection and enforcement. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is the lead negotiator for IPR provisions in U.S. trade agreements, including the TPP and T-TIP. It enforces U.S. rights under trade agreements and monitors IPR protection of trading partners through the Special 301 Report. The USTR also administers the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. The Department of Commerce's Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers U.S. laws on patents and trademarks, develops IPR policies, and offers training programs to promote strong IPR regimes in foreign countries. The PTO's IPR Attach\u00e9 Program places experts overseas to influence international IPR protection and enforcement. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces criminal laws to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) in the United States and internationally through prosecution of IPR cases. Key units responsible for IPR enforcement within the DOJ include the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney's Office, and the Civil Division. The key units responsible for enforcing intellectual property rights within the Department of Justice are the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney's Office, Civil Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Office of Justice Programs. These units prosecute intellectual property crimes, with a focus on disrupting and dismantling criminal organizations involved in theft of intellectual property. Other priorities include investigating counterfeit products and trade secret theft. The Civil Division prosecutes civil actions to recover penalties imposed by CBP for importation of counterfeit goods, defends CBP enforcement of Section 337 exclusion orders, and awards grants to support intellectual property enforcement efforts. DHS aims to facilitate legitimate trade while enforcing U.S. trade and IPR laws, investigating trademark, counterfeiting, and copyright piracy violations. Key parts of DHS involved in IPR enforcement include CBP, ICE, USSS, and the National Intellectual Property Rights. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) leads day-to-day IPR enforcement activities at the U.S. border, detecting and seizing counterfeit goods. CBP can determine penalties for trademark and copyright infringement, detain or seize infringing goods, and record rights in an electronic database. CBP does not handle patent infringements but can block imports infringing U.S. patents through a Section 337 investigation by the International Trade Commission (ITC). Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigates violations connected with U.S. borders, targeting international criminal groups and other criminals involved in importation and distribution. The U.S. Secret Service investigates counterfeiting violations and financial crimes, including computer-based attacks on critical infrastructure. The FDA, under the Department of Health and Human Services, works to protect public health by ensuring the safety of medicines and food, including combating counterfeit drugs entering the U.S. with the help of CBP. The FDA collaborates with the CBP to inspect FDA-regulated products at the border and conducts foreign inspections to ensure manufacturers meet quality standards. Funding for preventing counterfeits is part of overall import safety efforts. The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress administers U.S. copyright law and provides expertise on national and international copyright issues. The Department of State represents U.S. views in bilateral and multilateral arenas to build international consensus for IPR enforcement. The U.S. Department of State works to build international consensus for intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement in bilateral and multilateral arenas. The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) funds training and technical assistance to improve compliance with IPR agreements. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) investigates complaints of unfair trade practices and orders the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to stop imports that infringe U.S. patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) can order Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to halt imports that violate intellectual property rights (IPR). Damages for IPR infringement must be pursued through civil action in U.S. federal district court. The U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) coordinates federal agencies involved in IPR enforcement. The Property Enforcement Coordinator, established in 2008, develops a strategic plan for combating counterfeiting and piracy, assists in trade negotiations, and chairs an Advisory Committee. The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, housed within the Department of Homeland Security, aims to protect national security and the economy by combating IPR-infringing products. Led by ICE, the IPR Center coordinates federal efforts to combat intellectual property infringement. The IPR Center, led by ICE Homeland Security Investigations Director, focuses on law enforcement response to IPR theft. In contrast, the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) aims to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements through a \"whole-of-government\" approach. The Administration has emphasized the need for creating the ITEC to combat unfair trade practices, particularly by China. The USTR manages a private sector advisory committee system for trade policy, including 16 Industry Trade Advisory Committees (ITACs) that provide information on U.S. negotiating objectives, existing trade agreements, and other trade policy matters. Membership in ITACs includes industry and labor representatives, covering a range of economic sectors and policy issues, with one ITAC focusing on IPR."
