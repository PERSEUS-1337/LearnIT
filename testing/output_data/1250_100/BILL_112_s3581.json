Applicants must submit applications to the Secretary for an allocation under specific terms and conditions. The Secretary will rank applications based on the date received, giving priority to earlier submissions. Concurrent applicants for certification on the same date will also receive higher priority. The Secretary will allocate tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested and the rank of the application. Projects with earlier construction commencement dates will be given higher priority. There is a limitation on the amount of tonnage that can be allocated to each project. The Secretary will allocate tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested and the rank of the application.

Certification is required before receiving credits for capturing qualified carbon dioxide, with specific timelines for project milestones and potential revocation of certification for materially inaccurate representations. The Secretary may revoke a certification if an applicant makes a materially inaccurate representation or fails to timely place carbon capture equipment in service within specific timelines after the allocation was issued. The Secretary may revoke certification for inaccurate representation or failure to timely install carbon capture equipment. Any revoked certification or failure to obtain certification reallocates the national limitation to other projects as per Secretary's rules. Public disclosure of allocation, project description, and changes is required within 30 days. The Secretary can revoke certification for inaccurate representation or failure to install carbon capture equipment. Revoked certification reallocates the national limitation to other projects. The Secretary must issue an annual report summarizing credits allocated and available for allocation. Amendments are made to section 45Q(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 45Q(a) is amended to include a 10-year credit limitation. The amendment defines carbon capture equipment as equipment to capture and pressurize qualified carbon dioxide. The credit is allowed to taxpayers performing carbon capture during a 10-year period after the equipment is placed in service or certified. The tax credit for capturing and disposing of qualified carbon dioxide is allowed to taxpayers who meet specific requirements outlined by the Secretary, with an option for the person disposing of the carbon dioxide to claim the credit instead. The tax credit for capturing and disposing of qualified carbon dioxide is subject to specific requirements outlined by the Secretary, with amendments made to sections 45Q(a) and 45Q(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, rules relating to credit recapture under section 45Q(d) have been updated to apply only to carbon dioxide captured or disposed of after the regulation is filed with the Federal Register. The amendments made by this section apply to carbon dioxide captured after July 31, 2013."
