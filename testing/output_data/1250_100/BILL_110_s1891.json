    "content": "IMMUNITY FOR REPORTS OF SUSPECTED TERRORIST ACTIVITY OR SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE. Immunity is granted to individuals who report suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior in good faith and based on reasonable suspicion. They are protected from civil liability under any law for making such reports, except if the report is knowingly false or made recklessly. Authorized officials who respond to covered activity with reasonable and good faith actions also have qualified immunity from civil liability. Authorized officials not entitled to qualified immunity are immune from civil liability if they take reasonable action in good faith to respond to reported activity. This immunity does not affect other defenses available to authorized officials. Those immune from liability can recover costs and attorney fees. An authorized official is defined as an employee or agent of a transportation system or other person. The term \"covered activity\" refers to any suspicious transaction or occurrence directed against a passenger transportation system indicating a potential violation of law related to threats or terrorism. It involves individuals such as transportation system officials, law enforcement officers, and Homeland Security personnel responsible for passenger safety and security. The term \"passenger transportation\" includes various modes of transportation such as public transportation, over-the-road bus, school bus, intercity passenger rail, passenger vessel, waterborne transportation, and air transportation. The term \"passenger transportation system\" refers to entities organized to provide passenger transportation using vehicles. The term \"vehicle\" is defined in section 1992(16) of title 18, United States Code. This section will take effect immediately upon the date of enactment of this Act and will apply to all activities and claims occurring on or after that date."
