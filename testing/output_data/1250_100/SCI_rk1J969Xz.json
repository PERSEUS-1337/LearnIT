    "content": "Estimating image location solely based on image contents is challenging due to contextual complexities. This study introduces a novel global meshing strategy for image geolocation, overcoming data limitations and improving model performance by incorporating additional information. Delaunay triangles are shown to be effective for geolocation in low volume scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art models using quad trees. Incorporating time of posting and user metadata can improve geolocation accuracy by up to 11% at the country level. Incorporating time of posting and user metadata can improve geolocation accuracy by up to 11% for country-level (750 km) locality accuracy to 3% for city-level (25 km) localities. Advancements in deep learning have expanded the possibilities of machine learning in computer vision, allowing for deeper analysis of contextual information in images. Estimating the geographic origin of ground-level images presents challenges due to uneven distribution of geo-tagged data and potential conflicting information. The work focuses on content-based image geolocation, identifying the geographic origin of ground-level images. With the rise of image-based social media, inferring geographic context from images without explicit geolocation information is a significant challenge. The paper discusses various approaches for geolocation from image content, building on recent work in global geolocation from ground-based imagery. It includes utilizing a multi-class approach with one-hot encoding and performing instance-level scene retrieval for geolocation. Additionally, it mentions prior work on data sampling strategies for large-scale classification problems in social media applications. The paper explores geolocation from image content, focusing on random sampling for rare classes in social media applications. Different models are considered, including geolocation based on image content, time information, and user-album inputs. The study demonstrates the use of alternative methods for geolocation and the importance of time and user information. Data from YFCC100M BID17 is used for training and validation. The study validates geolocation models using a randomly selected subset of geolabeled imagery. Data from YFCC100M includes user-id and posted-time, which influence the true GPS location of an image. The global-scale geolocation model subdivides the globe into a grid for classification regions, similar to PlaNet BID19's approach. Training involves an image classifier to predict location based on time of posting. The study uses a geolocation model with a randomly selected subset of geolabeled imagery. The model subdivides the globe into a grid for classification regions using a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture, different from PlaNet's quad-tree mesh approach. The triangular mesh is deployed to be more adaptive to Earth's geometric features. The study utilizes a geolocation model with a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture that is adaptive to Earth's geometric features. The mesh is refined based on the number of examples in each cell, with options for adjusting refinement levels. The mesh initialization parameters were not explored, and the mesh for coarse and fine levels are shown in Figure 2.1.1. The geolocation classification mesh can be tuned by modifying the refinement level to control the number of cells in each mesh. The study utilizes a geolocation model with a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture that is adaptive to Earth's geometric features. The mesh is refined based on the number of examples in each cell, with options for adjusting refinement levels. The mesh parameters for three different meshes are shown in a table, covering a range of mesh structures. The fine mesh does a better job at representing geographic regions compared to the coarse mesh. Portugal's geographic boundaries are not accurately represented by the coarser mesh used in the study. The Inception v4 convolutional neural network architecture is deployed to create a mesh-based geolocation model (Model M1) with a softmax classification approach. Cells are labeled based on the cell centroid in latitudelongitude, and the geolocation for each cell is specified as the lat/lon centroid of the image population. Significant improvements are expected for coarse meshes, especially in high-density population regions. Models are evaluated by calculating the distance between points. The study uses a mesh-based geolocation model with a softmax classification approach to evaluate models for high-density population regions. Error thresholds are defined based on distance classifications, and posting time is utilized in model M2. The one-hot encoding of images for geolocation classes is used to determine strong evidence for classification. The study incorporates time dependence in the geolocation model by appending related variables to the output of the model. A new model, M3, utilizes Bidirectional LSTMs to geolocate multiple images from a single user by leveraging correlations between the user's images. This approach differs from previous models that organized images by topic or location. In M3, images by a single user are organized sequentially in time with no specific further organization. The study explores if the success of BID19 extends to this less informative image organization. Images are grouped into albums of size 24, padded with zeros if needed, and masking is used. Album averaging, as seen in PlaNet, assigns images in an album to a mesh cell based on average probability. A similar concept is applied to user images for location determination. LSTM on a time-ordered image sequence was also considered. The study investigates the performance of models M1, M2, and M3 on geolocation using mesh cell probabilities. Meshing parameters are analyzed to understand sensitivity to mesh adaptation, showing a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. Results indicate that coarse mesh improves large granularity geolocation while fine mesh performs better at finer-granularities. Additionally, the impact of classifying on the centroid of training data versus using cell centroids for class labels is compared. The study compares the performance of models M1, M2, and M3 on geolocation using mesh cell probabilities. Results show that coarse mesh improves large granularity geolocation, while fine mesh performs better at finer-granularities. Utilizing the centroid of training data for classification labels shows a significant improvement for coarse mesh and a modest improvement for fine mesh. The BID20 model, combined with indoor-outdoor label deliminations, filters geolocation inference on outdoor imagery without re-training the geolocation model. Results demonstrate a 4-8% accuracy improvement for region/country localities and a more modest boost in smaller-scale regions. The Im2GPS testing data is used to evaluate the model, showing improved performance even with fewer training data and classification regions compared to previous models. The study compares models M1, M2, and M3 for geolocation using mesh cell probabilities. Coarse mesh outperforms PlaNet for large regions, with a slight accuracy gain when using time. The difference in error between using time (M2) and not using time (M1) is statistically significant. The Wilcoxon-Signed-Test shows a significant advantage in favor of using time-inputs. The study compares models M1, M2, and M3 for geolocation using mesh cell probabilities. Coarse mesh outperforms PlaNet for large regions, with a slight accuracy gain when using time. The difference in error between using time (M2) and not using time (M1) is statistically significant, with a p-value < 10 \u221216 in favor of using time-inputs. The distribution of errors is mean shifted, but not uniformly to lower error, and images are not universally predicted closer to the truth. Time input models have lower-bias class probabilities, and cross-entropy was optimized in training for both models. KL-Divergence is calculated for each model, comparing model output class frequencies to true class frequencies. \"User-Averaging\" is incorporated into results as a simple method that appears more accurate than predicting individual images with M1 or M2. The study compares models M1, M2, and M3 for geolocation using mesh cell probabilities. Coarse mesh outperforms PlaNet for large regions, with a slight accuracy gain when using time. User albums with LSTMs show the lowest class bias. Different spatial resolutions are compared, with time inputs improving accuracy. The best possible accuracy is discussed for fine and coarse mesh models. Conditioning on latent variables can improve geolocation models by using time of day, which increases accuracy and lowers bias. Time information was found to be a weak addition to Inception-like results but significantly improved geolocation accuracy. Accounting for indoor/outdoor scenes in images also explained variation in validation accuracy, with outdoor-only results performing better. Future work could involve concatenating the probability that an image is outdoor to improve model performance. Increasing the granularity of a grid improves accuracy at street and city levels but reduces accuracy at country and regional levels. Street level geoinferencing is not practical with a coarse mesh. A coarse mesh is superior for 200 km resolutions, and using a Delunary triangle-based mesh allows for training accurate models with fewer examples. Validation data was divided into training and validation sets for different models to prevent overlap in training data. During training of large models, a procedure was developed to address challenges with softmax classification. The approach involved training a pre-trained model with Adagrad, increasing training examples each epoch, oversampling minority classes, and reducing class bias after each training cycle. This method resulted in diverse learning for majority classes. The final model was trained with SGD, using a linearly decreasing learning rate reduced at 4% with each epoch, without class biasing and with the full dataset per epoch. The layers of M2 are described in TAB0. M2 is trained using He initializations, initial iterations of Adaboost, followed by ADAM at learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation accuracy. The generality of the M1 classification model is demonstrated by performing a query-by-example on the 2K random Im2GPS dataset. The latent class distribution is assumed constant between training, testing, and application. The last layer output from networks is a softmax model for classification distribution. The KL-divergence between q and p should be low if training is done well. The entropy of p and q is also considered for completeness."
