    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law of 2010 did not change these parity requirements. The federal parity law ensures equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. It applies to certain plan types, including Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through the Exchanges, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA expands the law's applicability to additional plan types and requires compliance with federal parity law for all QHPs. The ACA expands federal parity law to include all QHPs, individual market plans, and certain Medicaid plans. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must partially comply with federal parity law, ensuring equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. Federal parity law exemptions apply to fully insured and self-insured small plans, traditional fee-for-service Medicaid, and traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Small employer group health plans with 2-50 employees are exempt, including \"groups of one.\" The ACA did not amend the small employer exemption. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid may not meet certain parity requirements. Traditional fee-for-service Medicare is also not subject to federal parity law. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but federal law requires copayments for covered Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services to be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. The law aims to mitigate disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services. While federal parity law does not mandate coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services, it requires parity with medical and surgical services if they are covered. This approach is known as a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA did not change this fundamental approach to federal parity law, but it included broader changes that create requirements for coverage. The ACA included broader changes creating requirements for coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services through the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) in the Exchanges. The EHBP must include 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA requires the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) to include mental health and substance use disorder services. A report by the Department of Labor found that most health plans offer these services. The specific services included in the EHBP will be determined through the rulemaking process, with the HHS Secretary having discretion to add additional benefits. The HHS released an informational bulletin in December 2011 outlining a proposal for states to define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options for benchmark plans, with benefits comparable to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested input from the Institute to inform the EHB definition. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study and make recommendations on Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The IOM released a report on the criteria for determining the EHB. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services through either the EHBP or EHB for certain types of plans. The ACA requires QHPs and new plans in the small and individual market to include coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014. Medicaid benchmark plans must also cover EHB. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of Exchanges are exempt. Health reform law changes will likely improve access to mental health and substance use disorder services by requiring coverage on par with medical and surgical services, potentially leading to voluntary compliance with federal parity law for competitive advantage in the private market."
