    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement as part of its strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP aims to liberalize trade among 12 countries and has implications for U.S. relations. Congress played an active role in negotiations and would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to take effect. The potential impacts of the TPP are a subject of debate in Congress. The TPP is seen as a strategic tool for the US to exert influence in the region and beyond, strengthening alliances, enhancing national security, and driving economic growth. China's economic rise is a key factor in analyzing US influence in the region. China's rise in trade and investment initiatives in the region is seen as a challenge to US influence. The TPP is viewed as a way for the US to maintain leadership in Asia and establish trade norms in response to China's regional initiatives. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to China could be counterproductive, as US and Chinese goals for trade liberalization may actually complement each other. Trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region involve a balance between economic and political elements, creating tension for policymakers. The debate over the TPP focuses on its potential impact on the US economy, with supporters emphasizing strategic implications that are hard to quantify. This report examines strategic arguments for and against the TPP, with a focus on implications for Asia. Congress will need to consider these strategic issues as it evaluates the final agreement. The report discusses strategic issues for Congress to consider regarding the TPP agreement, emphasizing the geostrategic importance of U.S. trade policy initiatives in Asia. The U.S. has historically used trade agreements like FTAs to advance foreign policy goals, with agreements in the 2000s focusing on security and foreign policy objectives. The TPP is seen as crucial for shaping the global economic order and sustaining U.S. leadership. The TPP agreement is crucial for shaping the global economic order and sustaining U.S. leadership in Asia. It is seen as a key signal that the United States is actively integrated into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. If not approved by Congress, the U.S. could be perceived as weak in its leadership role in the region. The TPP agreement is crucial for shaping the global economic order and sustaining U.S. leadership in Asia. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP, stating that failing to get it done would hurt the credibility of the U.S. worldwide. Proponents argue that the TPP is essential for developing and strengthening regional institutions to foster cooperation and peaceful resolution of differences. Diplomacy today can advance global prosperity by strengthening international rules and norms for trade and growth. Proponents of the TPP argue that it will reinforce U.S. alliances and partnerships in East Asia, but critics question the specific security benefits of the agreement. The strength of bilateral political and security relationships may depend more on countries' security interests rather than trade agreements like the TPP. The KORUS FTA and TPP may not significantly impact the U.S. alliances in East Asia. Japan's strategic decisions drive its cooperation with the U.S., while the TPP could have a greater effect on countries like Vietnam, pushing for market-oriented reforms. Approval of the TPP by Vietnam could signal closer ties with the United States and impact perceptions of reliability. Proponents argue that the agreement will help promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values, including a rules-based trading system. The link between TPP's trade rules and security relationships is less clear but could influence countries' strategic interests. Implementing the TPP would solidify the United States' presence in the Pacific, signaling its commitment to the region. Failure to pass the TPP could be seen as a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in Asia, potentially creating a vacuum for China to fill. U.S. credibility in Asia is already being questioned amidst China's rise and North Korea's threats. The TPP backers argue that rejecting the agreement could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation, impacting U.S. influence in shaping trade and investment. The TPP aims to promote economic growth, encourage market opening, and address new trade barriers to influence future trade regimes. The United States aims to update trade rules through new negotiations at the WTO or future FTAs, addressing critical gaps and influencing future trade regimes. The goal is to modernize the rules-based trading system, building on past efforts to expand economic engagement through trade. The current WTO Doha Round has stalled, while global commerce has evolved with technological advancements. The United States aims to update trade rules through new negotiations at the WTO or future FTAs, addressing critical gaps and influencing future trade regimes. Global commerce has adapted to rapid advances in technology, leading to the need for new trade rules that address digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Countries like the United States are pursuing new trade agreements like the TPP to further liberalize trade and create economically significant blocs. The TPP's economic significance could grow as new countries join and domestic reformers use it as political cover to push forward with their own agendas. The TPP aims to provide greater access to the U.S. market and promote internationally recognized worker rights and environmental protection. Proponents believe it will attract interest from other countries, expanding trade liberalization in the region. However, some experts note that the TPP does not include major Asian economies like China, India, and Indonesia, limiting its comprehensive impact on trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific. Several large Asian countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, have expressed interest in joining the TPP in the future, along with Taiwan. Current domestic opposition exists in some Asian nations and current TPP parties debating ratification. U.S. FTA partners like South Korea and Colombia are likely candidates for TPP entry. Proponents argue that mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could influence multilateral negotiations and set new trade rules beyond WTO commitments. The potential shift of trade negotiations from the WTO to bilateral and regional agreements could hinder multilateral initiatives and weaken the WTO's role in trade liberalization. Mega-regionals like the TPP and RCEP may create overlapping rules, complicating the global trading system. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) aims to create a collective Free Trade Agreement (FTA) among ASEAN members and six other nations. RCEP differs from the TPP in terms of trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, labor, environmental provisions, and disciplines on state-owned enterprises. Some view RCEP as an alternative or challenge to the TPP, while others see them as potentially complementary agreements. The RCEP and TPP are seen as potentially complementary agreements, with some countries being members of both. The timing of their implementation and ratification could impact their relationship and the existing trade architecture in the region. APEC members, including all TPP and most RCEP countries, have discussed the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific since 2006. China's inclusion in or exclusion from the TPP may have significant implications for the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. Some argue that China is trying to minimize U.S. presence and power in the region, making the TPP necessary to counter this effort. The vision of regional economic development promoted by China differs from that advocated by the United States, potentially not aligning with U.S. interests. The proposed TPP, supported by its proponents, aims to shape a model in line with U.S. interests by creating rules and norms for other regional nations to join. The agreement's size and economic importance could influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions favorably towards U.S. interests. President Obama highlighted the importance of enforceable labor and environmental standards, IP protections, and market access in the TPP. A completed TPP could also push China towards further economic liberalization and encourage political reform within the country. Some argue that China may view the TPP as a tool to constrain its interests, potentially leading to actions against U.S. interests. They also highlight China's economic initiatives in Asia, suggesting that U.S. opposition could be seen as obstructionist and raise doubts about U.S. commitment to regional development. Additionally, they emphasize that Asian nations have their own trade policies and may not adopt policies that do not align with their interests. China's leaders are focused on transforming their nation into a prosperous major power through a strong economy, defense, and global role. They are implementing policies to strengthen the economy and expand China's global economic presence, including the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative to enhance trade and economic development. New financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Silk Road Fund are supporting these efforts. China is also working to increase the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, to simplify financial transactions. China's leaders are focused on transforming China into a prosperous major power through a strong economy, defense, and global role. They are implementing policies to strengthen the economy and expand China's global economic presence. The establishment of the RCEP is seen as laying the foundations for a broader FTAAP, inspired by Chinese leadership. China is actively promoting reforms in multilateral institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, and has created the AIIB as an alternative model for development banks. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are matched by actions in diplomatic and security spheres to reduce U.S. influence. China has attempted to refashion CICA into a new Asian security system and undertaken construction in the South China Sea to counter U.S. naval power. Views on the TPP have varied, with China initially seeing it as U.S.-dominated and isolating China. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process softened after Japan joined in 2013. Chinese officials have expressed interest in joining the TPP, stating that various FTA arrangements can foster a just and free trade order. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP, but Chinese officials find some standards difficult to implement. President Obama mentioned in June 2015 that China had shown interest in the agreement. President Obama mentioned in June 2015 that China had shown interest in joining the TPP. The United States aims to integrate China more fully into deeper trade commitments and establish new rules. A former Obama Administration official believes that a high-standard agreement like the TPP could subject China to new rules and discourage attempts to weaken existing trade rules. Negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty with China are ongoing, which could pave the way for China's potential participation in the TPP. Congress has been involved in guiding and overseeing the TPP negotiations since the U.S. joined in 2008, and approved legislation in 2015 to renew Trade Promotion Authority. The TPP agreement aims to promote respect for international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging economic and political reform. Congress plays a direct role in considering and implementing TPP legislation. The TPP agreement aims to promote respect for international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging economic and political reform. Congress may weigh trade-offs among the agreement's many potential implications, considering strategic arguments and the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy. Some argue that the TPP's strategic impact depends on membership expansion, while others see it as an opportunity for like-minded countries. The proposed TPP, established by like-minded countries, offers the United States the best opportunity to pursue regional and multilateral trade policy goals. Congress must consider the implications of failed ratification, as it could set back U.S. leadership in the region and impact foreign governments' views on U.S. credibility. Failure to ratify the TPP may lead to delays in forming an alternative agreement, while other countries in the region continue to pursue their own trade arrangements. The TPP's 12 participating countries do not include several strategically and economically important nations in the Asia-Pacific region. Observers urge the U.S. to expand economic engagement beyond TPP membership to avoid neglecting other countries. Congress should consider if current economic initiatives in Asia are enough to further U.S. influence or if additional initiatives are needed. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations like the TPP may impact the multilateral trading system. The TPP negotiations may affect the multilateral trading system represented by the WTO. Some view these agreements as a way for the U.S. to establish new trade rules, while others are concerned about the potential negative impact on countries not involved. Congress needs to consider if the TPP will promote global trade liberalization or lead to fragmentation. Additionally, they should decide if new global trade initiatives are necessary to ensure the TPP benefits the global trading system and does not overshadow the WTO."
