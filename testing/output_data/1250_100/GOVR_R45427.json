    "content": "In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the first known cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are digital money validated by a decentralized network instead of a centralized intermediary. Since 2009, cryptocurrencies have gained public interest and are used in various financial transactions and products. Some governments are exploring issuing cryptocurrencies. Media coverage of cryptocurrencies is widespread, with many seeing them as the future of monetary systems. Cryptocurrencies are seen as the future of monetary systems by some, while others view them as a fad. This report assesses how well cryptocurrencies function as alternative electronic payment systems, discussing their benefits, challenges, risks, and policy implications. It reviews the basic characteristics of money, traditional money creation and transfer systems, features of cryptocurrencies, potential benefits, challenges, risks, and policy issues related to their use as money, including facilitating criminal activity and concerns about protections. Cryptocurrencies play a potential role in criminal activity and raise concerns about consumer protection. Money facilitates the exchange of goods and services, avoiding the inefficiencies of a barter system. Money is a mutually recognized representation of value for payment. Money serves as a recognized representation of value for payment, whether it be gold, paper currency, or digital entries. It must function as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. While potatoes could potentially be used as money due to their intrinsic value, their limited tradability and measurement system make them impractical for widespread use. Potatoes are not suitable as a form of money due to their varying sizes, freshness, and inability to be divided without losing value. In contrast, gold, dollar bills, and digital currency are more practical as they are easily tradable, divisible, and can serve as a stable store of value. Money has evolved throughout history, with early forms being precious metals like copper, silver, and gold. These metals had intrinsic value and were easily divisible, making them efficient for economic transactions. Society deems money valuable through traditional monetary systems, where government and banks play varying roles in the monetary system. Sand could potentially perform the functions of money due to its scarcity and malleability, but if it were used as currency, people would quickly hoard it, leading to inflated prices. In contrast to money with intrinsic value like precious metals, fiat money derives its value from government decree rather than inherent worth. Governments can declare a currency to be money, such as the dollar or euro, and mandate its use in economic activities. The government controls the supply of money to ensure its value and prevent counterfeiting. Modern monies like the U.S. dollar are fiat money, mandated for economic activities and taxes. The Federal Reserve maintains the dollar's value in the largest economy. The Federal Reserve in the United States maintains the value of the dollar by setting monetary policy as mandated by Congress in 1977. With a money stock exceeding $14 trillion, the Federal Reserve supports an economy generating over $20 trillion in new production annually. It also operates key electronic payment systems for interbank transfers, acting as an intermediary between banks. Banks have evolved to provide alternatives to physical currency exchange, with the Federal Reserve ensuring the validity of transactions. Verifying the valid exchange of physical currency is relatively easy, with the payer showing the payee possession of money. However, physical money is susceptible to theft or loss. Banks offer secure services for transferring money between parties not in physical proximity, using accurate ledgers to store numerical data instead of physical currency. In a payment system, numerical data is stored in a ledger instead of physical currency to prevent loss or theft. Participants must trust banks for accurate ledger maintenance to avoid unauthorized transfers. Banks have market incentives and are regulated by governments to ensure security and accuracy in transactions. Regulations ensure banks are well-run and money is safe. Electronic payments face issues like double spending. Trusted intermediaries like banks resolve this problem in electronic transfers of money. Electronic payments involve trusted intermediaries like banks facilitating transfers of money electronically. Participants send electronic messages to intermediaries instructing them to make ledger changes. Intermediaries validate transactions, ensure funds are available, deduct from payer's account, and add to payee's account. This process involves significant costs and infrastructure to ensure integrity, performance, and availability of electronic money transfer systems. Intermediaries play a crucial role in electronic payments by operating and maintaining vast networks to connect retail locations with banks. They store and protect large amounts of data and are highly regulated to ensure safety, profitability, and consumer protection. Intermediaries recoup costs and earn profits through fees charged for system usage or related services. Consumer protections are also mandated by laws like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the Fair Credit Billing Act. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges faced by individuals who lack access to electronic payment systems, leading to underbanked or unbanked populations. It highlights the need for personal information to use these systems and the potential risks of data exposure. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer an alternative to traditional electronic payment methods. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin provide an alternative electronic payment system where transactions are validated by a network of computers. Users establish accounts with pseudonymous names and private keys to transfer cryptocurrency. Accessing the system involves creating a wallet with a third-party exchange. Cryptocurrency platforms use blockchain technology to validate transactions, ensuring security through cryptographic protocols and digital signatures. Transactions are entered into a public ledger after being validated by network members solving computational decryptions. This system allows parties to exchange digital currency securely without needing to trust each other directly. Cryptocurrency platforms incentivize users to validate transactions by awarding them newly created units of currency. The rate of new units created is limited by platform protocols to create scarcity and retain value. Users can mine cryptocurrencies by performing work to extract value or acquire them on exchanges using official currencies or other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency ledgers using blockchain technology are considered secure, but hackers have exploited vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrency. Analyzing data on cryptocurrency use is challenging due to decentralized nature and the vast number of cryptocurrencies in circulation. The report focuses on Bitcoin as an illustrative example of the cryptocurrency industry, which is valued at almost $220 billion. Bitcoin's price surged in 2017, peaking at $19,650 before declining by 65% to $6,905. Other major cryptocurrencies like Ether and Litecoin also experienced similar price movements. As of October 7, 2018, the price of one Bitcoin was $6,570. The price of Bitcoin on October 7, 2018, was $6,570 with approximately 17.3 million Bitcoins in circulation, totaling about $113.6 billion. Recent volatility in cryptocurrency prices raises concerns about their function as a unit of account and store of value. The number of Bitcoin transactions can indicate its use as money, despite fluctuations in exchange rates. The number of Bitcoin transactions averaged about 208,000 per day globally in 2018 through August. In comparison, the Automated Clearing House processed almost 59 million transactions per day on average in 2017, while Visa's payments systems processed over 300 million transactions per day globally in 2017. The use of cryptocurrencies in payment systems is still limited compared to traditional systems, but potential benefits and challenges are being discussed for widespread adoption in the future. Cryptocurrency proponents believe that decentralized payment systems operated through the internet could be more cost-effective than traditional payment systems. They argue that cryptocurrencies may offer significant cost advantages, especially for international money transfers and payments. Cryptocurrency transactions are conducted over the internet, avoiding the need for intermediaries in different countries and currency exchanges. Traditional payment systems have high costs, including fees charged by intermediaries, leading to policy concerns. For example, Congress addressed high debit card swipe fees in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act limits debit card swipe fees for banks with assets over $10 billion. Cryptocurrency proponents argue it can reduce costs and provide an alternative for those who mistrust traditional financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies could be a desirable alternative in countries with a higher degree of mistrust towards traditional financial institutions. Developed economies like the United States may have less mistrust due to stability, low inflation, and regulated financial institutions. Mistrust in traditional institutions can stem from concerns about bankruptcy, loss of funds, or privacy issues when divulging personal information for banking. Financial institutions store personal information and transaction data, which may be shared with credit-reporting agencies. Concerns arise over data security after hackers target financial institutions. Some individuals prefer using cryptocurrency for increased privacy and control. Others distrust government-backed fiat currency due to historical incidents of hyperinflation. Decentralized networks with cryptographic protocols are trusted more for limiting new money creation. Cryptocurrencies must be used as money to realize their benefits, relying on network effects for value. Challenges to widespread adoption exist, hindering their function as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Currently, few businesses or individuals accept cryptocurrency for payment. In 2018, there were 208,000 daily Bitcoin transactions globally, with some used for investment rather than payment. Cryptocurrencies face challenges as legal tender and trust issues, hindering their adoption as a medium of exchange. High price volatility undermines their role as a unit of account and store of value. Cryptocurrencies face challenges as legal tender and trust issues, hindering their adoption as a medium of exchange. High price volatility undermines their role as a unit of account and store of value. Bitcoin lost almost 53% of its value in the first half of 2018, equating to a 346% annualized rate of inflation, compared to 2.1% for the U.S. dollar. The scalability of cryptocurrency systems is uncertain, with current technologies unable to handle the volume of transactions needed for widespread adoption. Bitcoin processes only a small fraction of daily financial transactions, with established payment systems dominating the majority. Bitcoin's processing speed is slow compared to electronic payment methods like credit cards, with transactions taking over an hour to be posted due to limited block space. The slow speed is attributed to the large computational resources needed for mining transactions. As cryptocurrency prices have decreased, the incentive for miners to validate transactions has also decreased, leading to less investment in faster computers and ballooning electricity requirements. The energy consumption required for cryptocurrency mining is substantial, with daily needs comparable to a small country like Ireland. High energy consumption raises questions about efficiency and negative externalities. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible and pseudonymous, requiring trust between parties unless done face-to-face. Cryptocurrency transactions require trust between parties unless done face-to-face. Risks of non-delivery or non-payment could hinder the use of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency escrow services offer a solution by holding the buyer's cryptocurrency until delivery is confirmed. Cryptocurrency escrow services hold the buyer's cryptocurrency until delivery is confirmed, allowing parties to exchange goods and services without trusting each other. However, the reliance on escrow introduces the need for a trusted third-party intermediary, raising concerns about security and trustworthiness. For cryptocurrencies to become widely accepted as payment systems, new procedures and intermediaries must establish sufficient trust and efficiency. Policymakers face challenges in adapting financial laws to the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. Before the invention and growth of cryptocurrencies, existing laws and regulations may not adequately address the risks associated with them. Some common risks include the potential for criminal activity and lack of consumer protections. Criminals prefer cash for its anonymity, but the pseudonymous and decentralized nature of cryptocurrency transactions could also be exploited for illicit activities, as seen with Bitcoin being used on illegal online marketplaces like Silk Road. The Silk Road facilitated over 100,000 illegal drug sales using Bitcoin before being shut down by the government. Despite criminal use, the benefits of cryptocurrency may outweigh the societal costs. Law enforcement can track criminal finances through the public ledger of cryptocurrency transactions. Cryptocurrencies can be linked to exchanges and are not always anonymous. Law enforcement can regulate exchanges for suspicious activity. FinCEN regulates virtual currencies and considers exchangers and administrators as money services businesses subject to federal regulation. MSBs must register with FinCEN, report suspicious transactions, and maintain anti-money laundering programs. State laws impose various anti-money laundering requirements on money services businesses. Bills in the 115th Congress focus on criminal use of cryptocurrencies, such as H.R. 2433 and H.R. 5036, which aim to address terrorism and illicit activity involving digital currencies. The House passed bills H.R. 6069 and H.R. 6411 to address terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies. The IRS treats virtual currencies as property for tax purposes. The bills aim to enhance FinCEN's powers in coordinating anti-money laundering efforts with emerging technologies. The IRS identified 800 to 900 tax returns per year from 2013 to 2015 with capital gains from cryptocurrencies. An analysis estimated $25 billion in U.S. tax liability on cryptocurrency gains in 2017. Concerns have been raised about potential tax evasion due to lack of clarity on reporting gains from cryptocurrencies. Data on this issue is scarce as the IRS has only recently started collecting customer information. The IRS has started collecting customer information from cryptocurrency exchanges to address concerns about tax evasion. Some individuals or entities may also use cryptocurrencies to evade financial sanctions, as seen with Venezuela, Iran, and Russia. While there is no specific regulation for consumer protection in cryptocurrency markets, existing laws at federal and state levels apply. Debate exists on whether these regulations adequately protect consumers and if they are overly burdensome. The debate over consumer protections in cryptocurrency markets includes concerns about investor awareness and protection from scams. While federal consumer protection laws do not specifically target cryptocurrencies, existing laws may apply to cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses. For more in-depth analysis, refer to CRS Report R45221 and CRS Report R45301. Consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, apply to cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses. The FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have enforcement authorities to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in the cryptocurrency industry. While the CFPB has not actively regulated the industry, it accepts complaints and has the potential to enforce consumer financial laws. Consumer protection laws apply to cryptocurrency exchanges and related businesses. The FTC and the CFPB provide informational material to educate consumers about risks in cryptocurrency transactions. State regulators have enforcement authorities against deceptive practices in the industry. Money transmitters, including cryptocurrency exchanges, must obtain state licenses and adhere to regulatory regimes. Safeguards such as low-risk investments and surety bonds are required for customer protection. Consumers may be vulnerable to deception in this market. Consumers in cryptocurrency transactions may be at risk of deception or misinformation due to the newness of the asset. They could unknowingly face excessive fees, be misled about the true value of cryptocurrencies, or be unaware of potential risks like loss of value or theft. Irreversible transfers in cryptocurrency transactions may leave consumers without recourse. Certain consumer protection laws apply, but others do not currently cover cryptocurrency transactions. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 requires disclosures and protections for traditional financial transactions, but these do not apply to cryptocurrency transactions. State laws and consumer protections for cryptocurrency transactions vary, potentially leaving consumers inadequately protected. Congress may consider extending electronic fund transfer protections to cryptocurrency users and granting federal agencies more regulatory authority over cryptocurrency businesses. Proponents of cryptocurrencies argue that state regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges are overly burdensome and not suited to the industry's unique risks. They believe that requirements such as holding minimum assets are unnecessary and hinder the growth of the cryptocurrency market. If the United States does not reduce regulatory burdens on cryptocurrency exchanges, it may fall behind in the development of cryptocurrency systems. Some suggest enacting federal laws to preempt state-level requirements. The Federal Reserve has the authority to conduct monetary policy, and the adoption of cryptocurrencies could impact central banks' ability to implement monetary policy. Some propose central banks issuing their own digital fiat currencies. Central banks conduct monetary policy by regulating the circulation of money in an economy. If cryptocurrencies become prevalent, it could limit central banks' control over inflation as people start using them for transactions. This would require central banks to make larger adjustments to fiat currency or start buying and selling cryptocurrencies to influence their availability in the economy. Cryptocurrency's global circulation can impact economies, with one country's actions affecting others using the same cryptocurrency. This can lead to destabilization, price fluctuations, and challenges in managing multiple currencies. Buyers and sellers must monitor currency values, adding complexity to exchanges. The inefficiency of tracking exchange rates and multiple currencies led to the establishment of a uniform currency in the United States before the Civil War. Governments have generally not been directly involved in creating cryptocurrencies, aiming to eliminate the need for government intervention in money creation. However, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies poses risks and challenges, leading to discussions about central banks issuing their own digital currencies for efficiency and safety. The discussion on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is speculative. Central banks are considering creating blockchain-enabled payment systems, but the exact form of CBDCs is unclear. Some argue that CBDCs could offer efficiency gains over traditional systems. The introduction of CBDCs raises questions about their benefits, challenges, and impact on monetary policy. Central banks are exploring the use of cryptocurrency technologies for a faster, cheaper government-backed payment system. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) could involve individuals holding accounts directly at the central bank, potentially increasing systemic stability. Critics argue that there is no urgent need for CBDCs as existing electronic payment systems are already efficient. Concerns include the potential impact on bank lending and the expansion of central banks' role in lending. Central banks are considering the implementation of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to enhance payment systems. Critics raise concerns about the potential shift of deposits from private banks to CBDCs, leading to reduced lending by private banks. They also question the impact of CBDCs on systemic stability and central banks' ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. Central banks are exploring the use of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to improve payment systems. Critics worry about the possible decrease in private bank deposits and lending if CBDCs replace cash. They also question the impact on systemic stability and the central bank's ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. The future role and value of cryptocurrencies are uncertain, with concerns about their ability to replace existing money and payment systems. Cryptocurrencies are seen as a potential future payment method with benefits like economic efficiency, privacy, and independence. However, skeptics doubt their ability to effectively function as money and gain widespread use. Policymakers may face challenges related to cryptocurrency, such as concerns about crime facilitation, consumer protections, regulation, and impact on monetary policy."
