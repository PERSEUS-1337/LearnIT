Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which are home to endangered species like bowhead whales, polar bears, and seals. These ecosystems are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures and are being impacted by climate change. In January 2007, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species due to the projected loss of sea ice from global warming. The Department of the Interior missed the deadline to decide on providing protections under the Endangered Species Act in January 2008. Despite this, they moved forward with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea, a polar bear habitat. A court ruling in April 2008 mandated a decision on listing the polar bear by May 15, 2008. The United States Geological Survey projected significant loss of polar bear population due to sea ice changes by 2050. Global warming is the main threat, but oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses additional risks. Recovering spilled oil in these harsh environments is currently ineffective. The Minerals Management Service plans to offer millions of acres in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas for oil and gas leasing, which overlaps with vital polar bear habitat. A large oil spill during the broken-ice period could pose significant risks to the polar bear population and other marine mammals. Onshore industrial development activities to support offshore oil and gas development are also a concern. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas includes a restriction on offering or approving leasing, preleasing, or related activities until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of potential impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. It also includes reports on ongoing environmental studies and the submission of a report to Congress identifying missing information and evaluating study adequacy. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for additional studies or research needed to address missing information identified in ongoing and completed studies related to the listing of polar bears under the Endangered Species Act. It also includes the Secretary performing an oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations. The curr_chunk outlines the requirement for a standard ensuring 85% oil recovery within 30 days of a spill in any ice condition. It must be demonstrated before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. The standard ensures 85% oil recovery in any ice condition or season, closes areas seasonally for oil and gas activity due to response gaps, and establishes requirements for spill prevention systems. The Secretary must implement all National Research Council recommendations before allowing oil and gas activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. The response gap analysis calculates spill response system limits based on environmental factors to identify risks to wildlife and habitat, and mitigation measures must be established to avoid these risks. Based on a methodology accounting for factors' interplay, an assessment is made on local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. It includes evaluating the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors that may hinder achieving the oil spill recovery standard. Environmental and climate data are used for this analysis, leading to a quantification of the percentage of risk. The assessment quantifies the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve the oil spill recovery standard."
