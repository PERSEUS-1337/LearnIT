    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly post-9/11 with new technologies and policy changes overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as mandated by the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA). Congress also directed TSA to implement trusted traveler programs and utilize technologies to expedite screening for certain passengers. The TSA has faced challenges in implementing risk-based passenger screening strategies, leading to a reliance on a uniform approach. While technology improvements have enhanced threat detection, budget constraints and other factors limit a solely technology-driven screening approach. TSA personnel have limited resources for passenger screening. The TSA faces challenges in implementing risk-based passenger screening strategies due to limited resources. Airport screening procedures, such as removing shoes and separating laptops, can lead to unpredictable wait times and deter travelers. Critics argue that inflexible security methods have tainted public perceptions of TSA. TSA is shifting towards focusing on passengers with elevated security risks. The controversy surrounding risk-based passenger screening strategies stems from differing views on how to assess and mitigate security risks. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff emphasized the impossibility of achieving perfect security in a free society. Despite its imperfections, security measures can be tailored to minimize risks effectively. In aviation security, risk is managed by understanding threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Specific probability values are limited, so categorical techniques are used to quantify risk. Risk-based passenger screening focuses on detecting and managing threats to mitigate risk. In aviation security, risk is managed by identifying individuals who may pose threats and using detection technologies to screen for weapons and explosives. Vulnerabilities are addressed through multiple layers of security measures, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals. Consequences are primarily mitigated by emergency management and response activities. TSA focuses on defining the risk environment and establishing effective risk-based strategies for aviation security, including the use of risk scoring for air cargo security. The TSA primarily assesses airline passenger risks through categorical processes, using biographical data to assign threat levels. Behavioral indicators like ticket purchasing habits are also considered for risk scoring, though their validity is debated. Disagreements exist on which risks a security strategy should target, as seen in the controversy over allowing small knives on planes in 2013. The TSA considered lifting the ban on small knives, golf clubs, and baseball bats citing reduced threat levels and other security measures in place. Critics argued that risks from unruly passengers were not adequately addressed. Legislation was introduced to prevent the ban lift, leading TSA to abandon the proposal. This shift towards risk-based passenger screening contrasts with previous prohibitions on certain items. Former TSA administrator Hawley highlighted the challenge faced by screeners in balancing thoroughness with efficiency. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raise concerns about the overreliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in airport security. They argue that this approach may not effectively prevent terrorist attacks and suggest integrating detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities. This shift in approach would move away from TSA's historical practice of using rigid screening measures. The TSA may depart from rigid screening measures to adopt a more proactive and flexible approach, similar to Israel's risk-based security methods. Despite concerns about legality and practicality, Israel's approach has successfully prevented major terrorist attacks for over 40 years. The effectiveness of this approach in the United States remains uncertain. Risk-based screening in aviation security in the United States is more effective and feasible than the Israeli model. It is part of a multi-layered approach, allowing TSA to focus resources on high-risk passengers and adjust security measures based on threats. This approach may impact the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. In the early 1970s, risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening were used before 100% screening of all passengers became mandatory in 1973. The FAA utilized rudimentary passenger profiles to determine screening, which evolved with the deployment of metal detectors and X-ray scanners in the late 1970s. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask basic security questions to all passengers to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The questions used for security screening were criticized for being obvious and posed by untrained airline agents. They aimed to raise passenger awareness of security threats, especially regarding bombers. After the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing in 1988, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed to identify potential security threats based on flight reservation data. TSA eliminated the use of these questions in 2006. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for certain passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the use of CAPPS or a successor system to evaluate all passengers before boarding. This shift towards risk-based screening aimed to enhance security measures. The TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for passengers, including their carry-on and checked baggage. This risk-based screening approach was recommended by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team after the 9/11 attacks. The team suggested a nationwide program for vetting passengers to focus aviation security resources more effectively. In response, TSA developed CAPPS II, a system for identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. This system aimed to categorize passengers based on threat assessments for enhanced security measures. The TSA developed CAPPS II to categorize passengers for enhanced security measures, but controversy over privacy led to its cancellation in 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving watchlists and having TSA screen passengers against them, leading to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requiring TSA to assume watchlist screening from airlines. The TSA implemented the Secure Flight program in 2009 for domestic flights and in 2010 for international flights. It screens passenger information against the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), which includes the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities on the watchlists. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has around 875,000 names and is a source for foreign identities in the TSDB. The TSDB has expanded to include over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices post the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253. Secure Flight compares passenger data against the TSDB, \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists to determine access at airport checkpoints. Secure Flight screening measures compare passenger names to CDC list for public health concerns. Records are destroyed within 7 days if no watchlist match. Matches are retained for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists and disqualified individuals lists are kept until updated. Secure Flight development benefited from APIS experience with CBP. CBP collects passenger manifest data for international flights to the US and cross-checks against law enforcement databases and watchlists. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) to assess inbound and outbound international travelers by comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases. The system does not use risk scoring for passengers but does for cargo. Data in ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months and retained for up to five years. Travelers with passports from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through ESTA before boarding a U.S.-bound flight. CBP checks this data against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight uses risk-based analysis from government and airline data to assess passengers. TSA's SPOT program observes airport behavior to identify potential threats, with almost 3,000 BDOs deployed at 176 airports by FY2012 at a cost of $200 million annually. Questions remain about the program's validity and utility. The TSA's SPOT program, costing $200 million annually, has faced controversy due to questions about its scientific validity and operational utility. While TSA claims it is based on validated behaviors to identify potential threats, there are nuanced differences between SPOT and traditional law enforcement behavior analysis methods. Law enforcement typically focuses on specific crimes and uses extensive interviewing methods, unlike the group-focused approach of SPOT. The TSA's SPOT program, costing $200 million annually, has faced controversy over its effectiveness in identifying potential threats. Unlike traditional law enforcement methods that focus on specific crimes and use extensive interviewing techniques, SPOT relies heavily on non-verbal cues and observation techniques to rate suspicion quickly. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, reviews have questioned the program's ability to accurately identify individuals posing a threat to aviation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2010 that the SPOT program, costing $200 million annually, had allowed known terrorists to pass through checkpoints at multiple airports. GAO could not confirm any arrests of terrorists through the program and criticized its implementation without proper validation or cost-benefit analysis. TSA conducted validation studies showing its behavior detection techniques were more effective than random selection but did not release the study for independent review. TSA claimed to have addressed GAO recommendations for improving behavior assessment methods and program management. Despite positive validation results reported by TSA, doubts about behavior detection in the SPOT program persist. GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General question the validity and utility of the techniques used. Metrics used to evaluate the program do not directly align with TSA's mission to deter terrorism. Developing suitable metrics to assess the program's impact has been challenging due to the low occurrence of terrorist acts. Individual differences among Behavior Detection Officers in terms of referrals to law enforcement have been reported by GAO. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the effectiveness of the SPOT program, questioning the training, metrics, and oversight. Issues included wide individual differences among Behavior Detection Officers, lapses in records-keeping, lack of refresher training, and performance evaluation. Despite TSA's promotion of SPOT as a key part of its risk-based approach to passenger screening, doubts remain about its efficacy. Despite ongoing questions about the effectiveness of the SPOT program, Congress has not taken action to eliminate or revamp it. While behavioral detection approaches have faced criticism, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received more positive feedback. Pre-Check, which began in 2011 and became fully operational in 2012, is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and members of trusted traveler programs. Eligible travelers can also apply for Pre-Check for a fee at TSA enrollment centers. The Pre-Check program, similar to the former Registered Traveler program, involves biographical and biometric data collection for expedited screening. Initially, extensive background checks were conducted, but these were later eliminated as they were deemed unnecessary for threat determination. TSA has now reintroduced biographic-based background checks under Pre-Check. TSA has revived biographic-based background checks for the Pre-Check program, which issues a known traveler number for expedited screening. However, participants may still undergo random thorough physical screening to prevent exploitation. TSA's ability to authenticate boarding passes and traveler documents is limited, as their deployment of authentication technologies faces challenges. TSA issues known traveler numbers for expedited screening through the Pre-Check program. Applicants must submit biographic and biometric data for security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. Ineligibility criteria include recent criminal convictions or insanity findings. TSA's Pre-Check program requires applicants to undergo security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. Ineligibility criteria include recent criminal convictions or insanity findings. Applicants must pay an $85 processing fee and, if approved, will receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Those rejected can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records for corrections. TSA's Pre-Check program allows individuals to apply for expedited screening, but some may be disqualified based on their criminal record or other factors. The program has received positive feedback from frequent travelers, with plans to expand to 300 enrollment centers nationwide. However, the rapid expansion could potentially limit the benefits of the program. The TSA's Pre-Check program aims to expand to 100 airports by January 2014, with a goal of providing expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by the close of FY2015. Non-participating travelers may benefit from possible selection to use a Pre-Check lane through managed inclusion, which involves real-time threat assessments to identify low-risk individuals. Passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers perform initial screening of passengers in the checkpoint queue. Passengers can be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening lanes if not identified as high risk by the canine team or officer. Military personnel, including family members under 12, are eligible for Pre-Check lanes. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and Coast Guard will also be allowed to participate in expedited screening starting in mid-April. The Coast Guard will be allowed to participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check or a CBP trusted traveler program starting in mid-April 2014. Pre-Check lanes are used for uniformed airline crewmembers, who undergo background screening equivalent to Pre-Check applicants. Airline-issued identification credentials are checked against a database of participating airlines' flight and cabin crew personnel for eligibility for expedited screening. Military personnel and civilian employees with defense secret clearances undergo extensive background investigations for eligibility. The TSA considers individuals in specific sub-populations to be lower risk and comparable to trusted travelers. The credentialing process for military, defense personnel, and airline crews is seen as secure for expedited screening. TSA uses random selection for certain sub-populations for standard screening. Risk-based screening programs collect biographic and biometric data, as well as intelligence sources for potential threats. The TSA collects and retains data on individuals believed to pose a threat to aviation security. Different programs have varying data retention rules, with records of potential matches to terrorist or criminal databases kept for longer periods. Data voluntarily submitted, like in Pre-Check applications, is retained unless updated. TSA may use commercial databases for identity validation but does not share information with consumer reporting agencies. Personal data collected may be shared among DHS agencies. Data collected under risk-based programs can be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes. It may also be shared with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies at various levels for investigating violations. Data protection is ensured in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974. Appeals procedures are established for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The DHS has established an Office of Appeals and Redress to provide a fair process for individuals who believe they were wrongly identified as a threat and delayed from boarding a commercial aircraft. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail, with a 30-day response time. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS will outline steps to resolve the issue. The TSA allows passengers to appeal decisions made by DHS regarding the Secure Flight program. TSA is exploring the use of third-party data for expedited screening, emphasizing data accuracy and security. This could lead to the future use of commercial data for aviation security assessments. The announcement raises concerns about the potential use of commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, including in programs like CBP's ATS and TSA's Secure Flight. Privacy and data accuracy issues have been highlighted, with worries that personal information from non-federal government and private databases may already be used for screening purposes. Congress has previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, prohibiting the use of non-governmental sources for assessing passenger risk. Congressional oversight is crucial as TSA's risk-based approaches evolve, especially concerning the use of commercial data and behavioral profiling. Due to security reasons, many details of TSA's passenger threat assessment programs cannot be publicly discussed, making congressional oversight essential in reviewing these programs. Congressional oversight plays a vital role in reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy. It is important to assess how well these programs can adapt to evolving threats and incorporate new capabilities. The evolution of passenger screening processes, including terrorist watchlist consolidation and behavioral profiling, remains undisclosed. Changes post-Flight 253 incident and in behavioral detection methods are not publicly acknowledged. Congressional oversight may focus on TSA's risk-based strategy adaptation to threats, resource changes, and new technologies. Metrics for assessing effectiveness pose a challenge. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is difficult to assess due to the limited number of encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. Metrics for behavioral detection programs are questioned, with a focus on efficiency rather than security effectiveness. Concerns arise over false alarms and potential misidentification of threats. Efforts to reduce false positives may leave gaps in threat detection capabilities. Efforts to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening have focused on updating terrorist databases and implementing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of these measures has not been publicly disclosed. TSA anticipates risk-based security efficiencies will save $120 million and reduce staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015, raising concerns about compromising security effectiveness. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established practices to protect personal data and comply with Privacy Act requirements. Questions persist about whether TSA's risk-based approach to passenger screening effectively integrates various programs, adapts to changes in threats and resources, and identifies appropriate metrics for assessing program effectiveness. The TSA's risk-based programs aim to detect and mitigate threats to civil aviation while addressing false positives and ensuring privacy protections. Despite enhanced security measures post-9/11, the potential for large-scale attacks on aviation remains, sparking debates on balancing privacy with effective security strategies. This issue is likely to be a central concern for aviation security policy and potential congressional oversight."
