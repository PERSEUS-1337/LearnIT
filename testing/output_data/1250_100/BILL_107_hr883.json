    "content": "The Act titled \"American Land Sovereignty Protection Act\" is established for the purpose of protecting American land sovereignty. Congress finds that the power to regulate US lands is vested in Congress under the Constitution, some international land designations require Congressional laws for implementation, and actions may impact non-Federal lands. The Act reaffirms Congress's power over international agreements concerning US lands, protecting State powers and private property rights. It addresses conflicts with Congressional responsibilities and State sovereignty caused by the President's application of certain international agreements to US-owned lands. The Act aims to protect State powers, individual rights, and private property from Federal actions designating lands under international agreements. It also establishes a process for the United States to designate lands when necessary. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN WORLD HERITAGE SITE LISTING. Section 401 of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 is amended to restrict the nomination of US lands for the World Heritage List unless certain conditions are met, including ensuring no adverse effects on commercially viable land uses within 10 miles of the nominated lands. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing natural resources and impacts on land use within 10 miles of nominated lands for World Heritage List inclusion. The nomination must be authorized by a post-enactment law. The President can propose legislation for nomination authorization. The Secretary of the Interior must object to US properties being listed as World Heritage in Danger, unless certain conditions are met. The Secretary must report to Congress on the necessity and impacts of including a property on the World Heritage List. Authorization for inclusion must be granted by Congress through a joint resolution. The Secretary of the Interior is required to provide an annual report on each US World Heritage Site to specific congressional committees. The Secretary of the Interior must report annually to Congress on each US World Heritage Site, providing information on money spent, federal hours, contributions from non-governmental organizations, and complaints received. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AND TERMINATION OF UNAUTHORIZED UNITED NATIONS BIOSPHERE RESERVES. Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 prohibits Federal officials from nominating any lands in the United States for designation as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Program of UNESCO. Any existing designation as a Biosphere Reserve before the enactment of the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act will not have any force unless authorized by a law enacted between the enactment date and December 31, 2003, consists of US-owned lands, and has a management plan that does not restrict adjacent non-Federal property use. The Secretary of State must provide an annual report on each Biosphere Reserve in the US to specific congressional committees, detailing expenses, staffing, contributions from non-governmental organizations, and complaints received regarding reserve management. SEC. 5. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN GENERAL. Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 prohibits Federal officials from nominating, classifying, or designating U.S. lands for special use under international agreements without specific authorization by law. State or local government-owned lands also require legal authorization for such designations, while privately owned lands need the owner's written consent. Title IV of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 prohibits Federal officials from designating U.S. lands for special use under international agreements without legal authorization. This does not apply to agreements under specific acts or conventions. The term 'international agreement' refers to treaties, compacts, or agreements between the U.S. and foreign entities aimed at conserving the environment. Section 401(b) of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 is amended to replace \"Committee on Natural Resources\" with \"Committee on Resources.\""
