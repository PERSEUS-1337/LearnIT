The Act \"Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999\" highlights Congress's findings on the negative impact of successive military regimes in Nigeria, the progress made by the current regime under Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar, and the cooperation in combating international drug trafficking. Since 1993, the United States and other international members have imposed sanctions on Nigeria for human rights violations and political repression, some of which have been lifted due to recent political liberalization. Despite progress in protecting freedoms, decrees still suspend constitutional rights, allow indefinite detention without charge, and limit civilian court jurisdiction. Nigeria, as a party to various human rights agreements, is obligated to conduct fair elections. Nigeria has played a significant role in peacekeeping efforts within ECOWAS. Nigeria has been involved in peace efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Recent events in the Niger Delta highlight the need for ongoing monitoring as a return to military repression is possible. The United States aims to support Nigeria's transition to democratic governance and respect for human rights. The sense of Congress is for the President to coordinate with other countries to promote the rule of law, human rights, and democratic civilian government. The President should condemn human rights abuses in Nigeria and support the renewal of the mandate for the special rapporteur on Nigeria at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Assistance is also provided to promote democracy and civil society in Nigeria. Development Assistance for Nigeria should allocate not less than $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 to nongovernmental organizations promoting democracy, good governance, and the rule of law. Assistance recipients must represent a diverse cross-section of Nigerian society. The United States Agency for International Development should allocate at least $500,000 each fiscal year to support individuals or organizations promoting human rights in Nigeria. Additionally, the United States Information Agency should receive funding to raise awareness of democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in Nigeria. Congress finds that staff levels at the office of the United States Agency for International Development in Lagos, Nigeria are inadequate. It is recommended that the Administrator of USAID increase the number of US personnel in Lagos and consider placing personnel elsewhere in Nigeria. Prohibition on economic and military assistance to Nigeria, requirement to oppose multilateral assistance for Nigeria. Prohibition on economic assistance to the Government of Nigeria, including funds previously appropriated, defined as assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act and related financing, excluding disaster relief, refugee, and narcotics control assistance. Prohibition on military assistance or arms transfers to Nigeria under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including military assistance, arms transfers, and international military education and training. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibits military assistance or arms transfers to Nigeria, including training, financing, and the transfer of defense articles. The Secretary of the Treasury must oppose any multilateral assistance to the Government of Nigeria through international financial institutions like the African Development Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, along with other international financial institutions, are prohibited from providing assistance to the Government of Nigeria under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ADMISSION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN NIGERIAN NATIONALS. It is the sense of Congress that unless a democratic transition to civilian rule has occurred in Nigeria by July 1, 1999, visas should be denied to senior Nigerian government officials and military officers. SEC. 7. WAIVER OF PROHIBITIONS AGAINST NIGERIA IF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS MET. The President can waive prohibitions in sections 5 or 6 for a fiscal year if a determination is made regarding Nigeria's human rights practices and freedoms. This includes not harassing or imprisoning advocates, implementing a transition program, respecting freedom of speech and media, releasing political prisoners, and allowing international human rights monitors access. The President can waive prohibitions in sections 5 or 6 for a fiscal year if Nigeria has repealed laws granting undue powers to the military, suspended constitutional protection of human rights, ended indefinite detention without charge, and ensured policing in oil-producing communities is carried out without excessive force or human rights violations. Congressional notification is required for the President's determination to waive prohibitions in sections 5 or 6, with notification provided to appropriate congressional committees at least 15 days in advance, following procedures similar to reprogramming notifications under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 8. REPORT OF CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA.\n\nWithin 3 months of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of State must submit an annual report on corruption in Nigeria to congressional committees. The report will cover evidence of corruption by government officials, its impact on government services, US business interests, fraudulent schemes, and Nigeria's foreign policy. SEC. 9. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. SEC. 10. TERMINATION DATE. This Act will end on September 30, 2004."
