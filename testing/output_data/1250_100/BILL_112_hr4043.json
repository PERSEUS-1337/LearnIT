    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters. National defense activities at San Nicolas Island have not harmed the otters, but their expansion into the designated management zone may impact national security. Military training programs need flexibility due to real-world events. The Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans for military installations in California address the needs of threatened and endangered species and provide conservation benefits to marine environments. Public Law 99-625 allows for the designation of otters at San Nicolas Island as a nonessential experimental population to balance conservation efforts with military readiness activities. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter while ensuring military readiness. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates in the waters near Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, as well as Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas include specific coordinates in the waters near Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island, Begg Rock, and Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island. Activities within these areas are exempt from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act for the incidental taking of southern sea otters during military readiness activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities from the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Southern sea otters in these areas are treated as proposed endangered species for Endangered Species Act purposes. No federal law requires the removal of southern sea otters in these areas. The Secretary of the Interior may revise or terminate exceptions for military activities impeding sea otter conservation. The Navy must monitor sea otter populations every three years and report to Congress. The Secretary of the Interior may revise exceptions for military activities affecting sea otter conservation. The Navy must monitor sea otter populations every three years and report to Congress. Additionally, a plan for ecosystem management in California waters will focus on the recovery of the southern sea otter, endangered abalone species, and maintaining shellfish fisheries. After the effective date of this section, assess the carrying capacity of the habitat for southern sea otters, including impacts of water quality and causes of degradation. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until completion of required management plan and assessment. Definitions include incidental taking and optimum sustainable population. The term 'stock' refers to the number of animals that will maximize productivity while considering habitat carrying capacity and ecosystem health. 'Southern sea otter' is defined as a member of the Enhydra lutris nereis subspecies. 'Take' is defined in relation to regulations under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act. 'Military readiness activity' is defined as per the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined as per the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, including training and operations related to combat, testing of military equipment for combat use.
