    "content": "Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for decision making, but often requires extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning eliminates the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still relies on a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning aims to automatically acquire rewards but struggles with large, high-dimensional problems. The proposed AIRL algorithm offers a practical and scalable solution based on adversarial reward learning, competitive with direct imitation learning. AIRL can recover robust reward functions that enable learning policies even with significant environmental variations. Deep reinforcement learning has reduced the need for feature engineering but still requires manual reward function specification, which can be challenging. Inverse reinforcement learning aims to infer expert reward functions from demonstrations to address this issue. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a potential method for solving reward engineering problems. IRL methods have been less efficient than direct methods like imitation learning, but adversarial IRL methods show promise for tackling difficult tasks by adapting training samples. The challenge with IRL is that it is an ill-defined problem due to the ambiguity of optimal policies and rewards. The MaxEnt IRL framework helps handle some of this ambiguity. Adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) addresses the ambiguity in reward functions shaped by environment dynamics. It introduces disentangled rewards that are invariant to changing dynamics. AIRL simultaneously learns the reward and value functions efficiently through adversarial learning, outperforming prior IRL methods. Our experimental evaluation shows that AIRL surpasses previous IRL methods on high-dimensional tasks with unknown dynamics. Compared to GAIL, our method achieves similar results on tasks not requiring transfer but outperforms on tasks with environmental variability. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a form of imitation learning that infers the expert's reward function. Our approach effectively disentangles expert goals from environment dynamics, leading to superior results. Our proposed method in this framework connects IRL to generative model training, resembling algorithms proposed by BID21, BID10, and BID5. Unlike GAIL, our method focuses on recovering reward functions rather than just the expert's policy. Interleaving policy optimization with reward learning within an adversarial framework is crucial for performance, as shown in prior work. BID22 also explores learning cost functions with neural networks but only evaluates on simple domains. Our IRL algorithm builds on the adversarial IRL framework proposed by BID5, with the discriminator corresponding to an odds ratio between the policy and exponentiated reward distribution. Direct implementation of the algorithm is ineffective due to high variance from operating over entire trajectories. Extending the algorithm to single state-action pairs is straightforward, but a simple form of the discriminator is susceptible to reward ambiguity, limiting generalization capability. The learned reward functions are not robust to environment changes, making it difficult to infer the intentions of agents. Our work focuses on achieving generalization within the standard Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) formulation. We build on the maximum causal entropy IRL framework, which considers an entropy-regularized Markov decision process (MDP). The goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the expected entropy-regularized discounted reward. The trajectory distribution induced by the optimal policy in Inverse Reinforcement Learning takes the form of an exponential function. IRL aims to infer the reward function from demonstrations drawn from an optimal policy. Optimization in IRL can be formulated as a GAN problem, where the discriminator updates the reward function and the policy improves the sampling distribution. The optimal reward function can be extracted from the optimal discriminator in generative adversarial network guided cost learning (GAN-GCL). This formulation improves the sampling distribution used to estimate the partition function. Unlike GAIL, GAN-GCL places special structure on the discriminator, allowing for recovery of the reward. However, using full trajectories can lead to high variance estimates, resulting in poor learning. Converting the formulation to single state and action pairs can address this issue, where the advantage function of the optimal policy is recovered. The algorithm in Appendix A efficiently solves the IRL problem, but may not be ideal for reward learning due to entangled rewards. The reward function may not be robust to changes in environment dynamics, leading to undesired behavior. IRL methods can fail to learn robust reward functions, with reward shaping being a key concept discussed. BID15 proposed reward transformations that preserve the optimal policy, highlighting the importance of policy invariance. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of IRL methods in inferring rewards from demonstrations and the lack of policy invariance in shaped reward functions when there are changes in dynamics. It presents a formalization of policy invariance in two MDPs with different dynamics but the same reward. Changing the dynamics can break policy invariance, as illustrated by a simple example. The curr_chunk introduces the concept of \"disentangled\" rewards, where a reward function is perfectly disentangled with respect to a ground-truth reward and a set of dynamics. It discusses the equivalence of optimal policies under maximum causal entropy RL and the requirement for learned reward functions to only depend on the current state. The chunk also mentions the training of a classifier to distinguish expert data from samples and updating the policy with respect to the learned reward function. The curr_chunk discusses updating the reward function with policy optimization methods and the importance of learning reward functions solely dependent on the state. It highlights the inability to learn a state-only reward function in a proposed method, leading to potential reward shaping issues. The text proposes modifying the discriminator to decouple the reward function from the advantage by adding a shaping term. This allows for extracting rewards solely based on the state, reducing unwanted shaping effects. The training procedure involves alternating between training a discriminator and updating the policy. This approach enables disentangling rewards from the environment dynamics, leading to optimal value function recovery. The text discusses the use of AIRL to learn disentangled rewards that are robust to changes in environment dynamics and its efficiency in high-dimensional continuous control tasks. It evaluates AIRL in transfer learning scenarios and compares it to other imitation learning algorithms. The study compares the performance of the AIRL algorithm with GAIL and GAN-GCL in various tasks, showing AIRL's superiority in transfer learning setups. It highlights AIRL's ability to scale to high-dimensional tasks with unknown dynamics and its capability to re-optimize learned rewards under environmental changes.

It highlights AIRL's ability to scale to high-dimensional tasks with unknown dynamics and its capability to re-optimize learned rewards under environmental changes. In a simulated scenario, the ground truth reward is hidden from the IRL algorithm to learn a reward function from demonstrations. Results show that AIRL with a state-only reward function can recover the ground truth reward, while AIRL with a state-action reward function recovers a shaped advantage function. In transfer learning experiments, the state-only reward achieves optimal performance, while the state-action reward only marginally improves over a random policy. Transfer learning experiments on continuous control tasks show the ability to learn disentangled rewards in higher dimensional environments. Results are compared between different IRL algorithms and direct policy transfer methods. Results for environment transfer experiments are presented in TAB2. The first task involves a 2D point mass navigating a maze with changing walls between train and test time. Only AIRL trained with state-only rewards consistently reaches the goal. In the second task, a quadrupedal \"ant\" agent is modified by disabling and shrinking two front legs, requiring a change in gait. AIRL learns reward functions encouraging forward movement with a modified gait. AIRL can learn disentangled rewards that accommodate domain shift in high-dimensional environments. GAN-GCL struggles with trajectory-centric formulation even in the original task. GAIL successfully learns in the training domain but lacks transferability to test domains. The shifting maze task illustrates the challenges of transferring learned behaviors to new domains. In evaluating AIRL as an imitation learning algorithm against GAN-GCL and GAIL on benchmark tasks, both AIRL and GAIL achieve similar performance levels, with little room for improvement. This challenges the belief that IRL algorithms are less efficient than direct imitation learning algorithms. The GAN-GCL method is ineffective on more complex tasks. AIRL outperforms GAIL on tasks requiring transfer and generalization by learning disentangled rewards that effectively transfer in the presence of domain shift. The method greatly surpasses prior imitation learning and IRL algorithms, recovering rewards that generalize well compared to GAIL, which fails to recover reward functions. In small MDPs, AIRL can exactly recover ground-truth rewards. In this section, the objective of AIRL aligns with solving the maximum causal entropy IRL problem. The method used is similar to BID5, justifying GAN-GCL for trajectory-centric formulation. The goal of IRL is to train a generative model over trajectories, maximizing the state-action marginal at each time step. To address the difficulty of sampling from the model, a separate importance sampling distribution is trained. The choice of this distribution follows BID5, using a mixture policy to reduce variance in the early stages of training. The policy in AIRL initially has poor coverage over demonstrations, leading to a new gradient. The policy trajectory distribution is factorized, and the discriminator objective aims to minimize cross-entropy loss between expert demonstrations and generated samples. The policy optimization objective is replaced with a new reward. Training the gradient of the discriminator objective is equivalent to a specific equation, involving a mixture between the dataset and policy samples. The policy objective in AIRL aims to maximize the reward function, with the global minimum of the discriminator objective achieved when the learned policy matches the policy under which demonstrations were collected. The output of the discriminator is 1/2 for all values, indicating a match between the learned policy and the expert policy. The decomposability condition in MDP dynamics allows for the separation of state-dependent functions, enabling the representation of functions as a sum of components. This condition ensures that all states in the MDP are linked with each other, facilitating the decomposition of functions. The decomposability condition in MDP dynamics allows for the separation of state-dependent functions, enabling the representation of functions as a sum of components. This condition ensures that all states in the MDP are linked with each other, facilitating the decomposition of functions. In order for functions to be representable, the term b(s) \u2212 d(s) must be equal for all successor states s from s, leading to b(s) = d(s) + const. If the learned reward is state-only, disentangled rewards are guaranteed. In deterministic environments, the optimal policy can change if the reward function depends on actions or states. A 3-state MDP example illustrates this, where optimizing rewards differently leads to different policies. AIRL can recover state-dependent ground truth rewards in deterministic environments."
