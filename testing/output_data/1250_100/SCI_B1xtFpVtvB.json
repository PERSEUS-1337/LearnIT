    "content": "In this paper, the authors investigate the overfitting of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in visual navigation tasks. They propose a regularization method called invariance regularization, which combines RL with supervised learning to improve generalization of policies to unseen environments. Learning control policies from high-dimensional sensory input has been gaining traction with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling simultaneous learning of perception and control modules. Evaluating learned policies in different environments is crucial for assessing generalization abilities, as variations in visual aspects, physical structures, and agent's goals can impact performance. In this paper, the study focuses on the generalization of visual control policies learned with DRL. The goal is to create robust policies that can adapt to changes in sensory inputs, surrounding structures, and task aspects. The research addresses the challenge of overfitting in DRL agents and the need for policies that can perform consistently in different environments. The study explores generalization of visual control policies with DRL, using an alternative training method that combines DRL with supervised learning. Experiments are conducted on the VizDoom platform to showcase how environments differ visually, impacting navigation for mobile robots. Classical approaches to navigation involve hand-engineering specific to the environment and task, making adaptation challenging. Deep learning approaches, specifically reinforcement learning algorithms coupled with deep learning, are used to navigate an agent towards a goal object using only visual observations. The problem is modeled as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), with finite sets of states, actions, and observations. The reward function and transition probabilities are defined within this framework. In reinforcement learning, the conditional observation probability mass function determines the probability of observing a specific outcome in a state. A parameterized policy is used to adjust parameters to maximize the discounted reward. Various methods aim to approximate optimal policies, such as policy gradient methods. In reinforcement learning, policy gradient methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm are used to learn optimal policies. These policies are learned from a distribution of POMDPs representing different tasks, and a common policy is derived from a sample of state-observation-action sequences from these POMDPs. In reinforcement learning, policy gradient methods like PPO are used to learn optimal policies from a distribution of POMDPs representing different tasks. A common policy is derived from state-observation-action sequences across these POMDPs, requiring common spaces S, A, and \u2126. The policy \u03c0 \u03b8 generalizes well if it attains high discounted generalization reward over the full distribution of POMDPs. This reward is equivalent to the discounted reward of a single larger POMDP P D with a state space S \u00d7 I D. Training in synthetic environments allows for efficient simulation of experiences in reinforcement learning. However, there is often a gap between synthetic and real-world dynamics, leading to challenges in transferring learning techniques to bridge this gap. Many have proposed transfer learning methods to address this issue and make use of fast simulators for training. One popular method to bridge the reality gap in training environments is domain randomization, shown successful for transferring grasping policies from simulation to the real world. Previous studies have focused on transferring perception modules rather than controllers. Cobbe et al. (2018) conducted a study using a new environment called CoinRun, finding that RL agents tend to overfit even with large training sets. Zhang et al. (2018a) also observed this tendency in grid-world environments. In grid-world environments, agents tend to memorize training set levels. Methods like sticky actions and random initializations do not prevent memorization. Our work focuses on generalization in partially observable environments. Domain adaptation methods transfer models from a source to a target domain. Bousmalis et al. (2017) successfully transferred a grasping policy from simulation to the real world. Generalization also involves transferring learned skills to solve different tasks. In grid-world environments, agents aim to achieve different tasks by maximizing reward functions. Schaul et al. (2015) introduce universal value functions that incorporate the goal as part of the agent's state. They propose universal value function approximators (UVFA) to estimate V \u03b8 (s, g) and show generalization capabilities in grid-world setups. Deep reinforcement learning is utilized for training control policies, including goal-conditioned and mapless navigation tasks. Control policies learned from visual input may lack robustness in novel situations. Our main contribution is a regularization term to improve the robustness of learned policies in reinforcement learning. We explore domain randomization as a technique to train policies that can generalize to variations in observations. By adding random noise to an agent's observations, we aim to test if it can still perform tasks in different environments. In this work, a regularization term is introduced to enhance the robustness of learned policies in reinforcement learning. The study explores domain randomization as a method to train policies that can adapt to variations in observations, aiming to test their performance in different environments. The research investigates the potential overfitting of policies to training environments and the effectiveness of training on multiple POMDPs to mitigate this issue. It is suggested that including a term in the training objective that promotes policy generalization is crucial for achieving good generalization. The regularization term introduced aims to enhance policy generalization in reinforcement learning by incorporating invariance to observation transformations in the objective function. This penalty term is added to the RL objective to ensure policies are robust to variations in observations, promoting adaptability to different environments. The invariance regularization (IR) method adds a penalty term to the RL objective to ensure policy robustness to observation transformations. It aims to promote adaptability to different environments by enforcing similarity between observations and their transformations. Two approaches are proposed to solve the RL problem: direct optimization of the full objective with the penalty term and a two-stage training process involving RL training followed by supervised learning to minimize the penalty term. The text discusses two methods for training RL agents: one involving a two-stage process of RL training followed by supervised learning to minimize a penalty term, and the other using domain randomization to reduce overfitting. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in improving the generalization of learned policies to unseen environments. The results show that using invariance regularization with domain randomization significantly improves the success rate of the agents. The study explores training algorithms for RL agents to generalize to different environments by leveraging VizDoom maps with various textures. An actor-critic agent is trained with a specific network architecture and ReLUs as non-linear operations. The PPO objective is optimized with a binary reward function and a discount factor. The study uses VizDoom maps with different textures to train RL agents. Agents are trained on varying numbers of rooms and tested on unseen textures. Different visual inputs are experimented with, and the role of adding a depth channel is highlighted for generalization. The study uses VizDoom maps with different textures to train RL agents on varying numbers of rooms. Adding a depth channel improves generalization, as shown in Table 1 where RGB-D agents outperform RGB agents. Overfitting is observed in agents trained on 100 and 500 environments compared to those trained on 10 and 50. The study highlights potential overfitting in RL agents trained on varying numbers of environments. Results show higher variance in success rates for agents trained on 100 and 500 environments compared to 10 and 50. Domain randomization alone may not effectively adapt policies to observation variations, leading to limited progress in success rates across different environments. The study suggests that domain randomization alone is not sufficient for generalization in RL policies. It is proposed to adapt supervised learning techniques to regularize models trained with DRL, using an IR penalty method. Two methods are discussed: adding to the PPO objective or splitting the objective into RL and supervised learning steps. The study proposes using supervised learning techniques to improve generalization in RL policies by adding an IR penalty to the PPO objective or splitting the objective into RL and supervised learning steps. Experimental results show that training with the full objective yields the best results, outperforming vanilla PPO with domain randomization and the split version of the IR algorithm. The split method also shows stable success rates and improved generalization, especially with RGB/Grayscale inputs. Training with the full objective of the IR algorithm shows stable performance and high test success rates with only 10 training environments. Adding more environments does not improve results as the model learns invariant features from a small number of environments. The RGB-D testing results also demonstrate near-perfect scores for agents trained with the full objective, attributed to the availability of an invariant feature map in the input. Regularization aids in generalization of supervised learning. Regularization has been shown to help in the generalization of supervised learning models. It often improves the performance of trained models on test sets. However, it has not been frequently used in DRL setups. Comparing with other regularization techniques like dropout, batchnorm, and L2, some methods achieve similar results in some instances. The lower success rate of other regularization methods indicates randomness in their learned policies, possibly due to poor practice of testing and training in the same environment. The study by Cobbe et al. (2018) evaluates different regularization techniques in training models for DRL. Their proposed method shows steady improvement with more environments. Dropout and L2 achieve similar success rates but result in higher policy entropy. High entropy policies may enhance robustness by allowing random actions. Success weighted shortest path length (SPL) is lower for random behaviors, indicating less direct paths to the goal. In the study, the authors focus on generalization capabilities of visual navigation agents trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They introduce Invariance Regularization (IR) as a method to improve generalization success and stability across different seeds. The research highlights the tendency of RL agents to overfit even with large training sets and the importance of adding invariant features to the input for better generalization. The study focuses on improving generalization capabilities of visual navigation agents trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They introduce Invariance Regularization (IR) to enhance generalization success and stability across different seeds. Future work includes exploring appropriate transformation functions for observations and training RL on one environment before using the actions to tune the model with supervised learning on textured environments. The training process involves two stages: training RL and then supervised learning without iterating between both. Experiments involve training on subsets of rooms with different surfaces. The study focuses on improving generalization capabilities of visual navigation agents trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms by introducing Invariance Regularization (IR). Training involves running agents in parallel on a subset of rooms with various textures from Vizdoom, then testing on a hold-out set. Agents sample one environment from the training set and run on it for a set number of episodes before sampling another one. SPL is used to measure navigation agent success rates."
