    "content": "The Act titled \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims the Secretary's right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The Act requires a new survey to identify the South Bank boundary line, conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors within 2 years. The survey must adhere to the gradient boundary survey method and be approved by the Texas General Land Office. Private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge within 1 year of survey approval. The Secretary must ensure that no parcels of land are treated as Federal land for resource management plans until the survey is completed and approved. This Act does not affect the States' or federally recognized Indian tribes' sovereignty rights over lands north of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Remaining Red River surface rights can be sold. After completing the survey and ensuring no further appeals, the Secretary will offer identified Federal lands for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales are subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights, with proceeds used to offset Act costs. A report on identified Federal lands must be submitted to relevant committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will offer identified Federal lands for competitive sale at fair market value, with proceeds used to offset Act costs. A report on any unsold lands and reasons for not selling them must be submitted to relevant committees within 5 years. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"affected area\" as lands along the Red River, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"South Bank\" as the elevation along the Red River, and \"South Bank boundary line\" as the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma. The \"boundary line\" refers to the Texas-Oklahoma boundary identified through the gradient boundary survey method established by the United States Supreme Court. This method recognizes that the boundary along the Red River is subject to changes due to erosion and accretion."
