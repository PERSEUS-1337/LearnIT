    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools outside the US and Canada to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for foreign graduate medical schools receiving Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. This is in response to concerns about the disproportionate funding received by three for-profit Caribbean medical schools, which have higher attrition rates compared to US medical schools. Graduates of for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more student debt compared to graduates of US medical schools. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduated students in a foreign medical school are not U.S. residents, and at least 75 percent of students or graduates are not from the U.S. or Canada. Canada nationals, including those from the United States, who pass exams by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before applying for a loan under part D of title IV are eligible. The authority of a graduate medical school to participate in loan programs under part D of title IV expires on the first July 1 after the enactment of the Foreign Medical School. The Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017 expires the authority of a graduate medical school to participate in loan programs under part D of title IV on the first July 1 after its enactment. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility to participate in loan programs under part D of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a student enrolled before the enactment of this Act can still receive loans while attending the school, subject to meeting academic progress requirements, until withdrawal, program completion, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
