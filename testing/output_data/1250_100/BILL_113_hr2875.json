The Administrator shall transmit a report to Congress within 180 days after a major disaster, defined as per the Stafford Disaster Relief Act, regarding the study on environmental impacts and pollution incidents in the water supply. SEC. 3. NATIONAL FREIGHT POLICY aims to account for socioeconomic and environmental impacts of moving cargo through communities in the national freight network. SEC. 4. NEXT GENERATION PORTS focuses on incorporating ports and harbors into the national freight network. Improvements to Port Infrastructure and Intermodal Rail and Highway Networks include grants for projects to enhance port infrastructure and transportation networks, considering local preferences and environmental concerns to minimize disruptions. Green Ports designation establishes environmental standards for ports, with grants and technical assistance available. The Maritime Administration can provide grants and technical assistance to designated green ports to implement innovations that reduce environmental impacts of port operations. SEC. 5. WATERFRONTS AS MAIN STREETS. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a grant program for environmentally sustainable waterfront projects. States and local governments can apply for grants by meeting specific criteria related to economic growth and environmental sustainability. The maximum grant amount will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may not make grants exceeding $10,000,000 to State or local governments. Recipients must submit annual reports on performance measures for 3 years. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 75 percent."
