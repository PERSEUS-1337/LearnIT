    "content": "In vanilla backpropagation, the choice of activation function is crucial for non-linearity and differentiability. This study introduces a method using iterative temporal differencing with fixed random feedback weight alignment to replace the derivative of the activation function. This approach makes error backpropagation possible without requiring a differentiable activation function, leading to a more biologically plausible way to learn deep neural network architectures. The study introduces iterative temporal differencing with fixed random feedback weight alignment as a biologically plausible approach for error backpropagation in deep learning. It aims to integrate spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) into deep learning, mimicking the dopamine effect in the brain for self-supervised and unsupervised learning. Additionally, deep reinforcement learning has been successfully implemented, and hierarchical convolutional neural networks have been inspired by the visual cortex. In the context of integrating spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) into deep learning, a study explores deep learning using segregated dendrites inspired by Hinton's recirculation idea. The implementation involves applying iterative temporal differencing (ITD) with fixed random feedback weight alignment to the VBP model using FBA. The experiments compare VBP, FBA, and ITD using Tanh activation function and different loss functions, with hyperparameters including 5000 iterations, 0.01 learning rate, and 100 minibatch size. The paper discusses using a feed-forward neural network architecture and proposes integrating spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) in deep learning through iterative temporal differencing. The next steps involve exploring STDP processes, dopamine-based unsupervised learning, and generating Poisson-based spikes."
