    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\". Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration. In the US, around 30,000 individuals have the disease, with 200,000 at risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Adult-onset typically occurs between ages 30-50. Late-onset Huntington's Disease occurs after 50 years of age with milder symptoms, while Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 years old and progresses rapidly. Individuals with Huntington's Disease often rely on Social Security Disability Insurance due to the disease's incapacitating nature. Despite medical advancements, the Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985, still using the outdated term \"Huntington's Chorea.\" The Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease are outdated and fail to recognize the full impact of the disease. Individuals with Huntington's Disease often face a 24-month waiting period for Medicare benefits, despite becoming incapacitated before the age-eligibility requirement of 65 years. This waiting period was waived for individuals with ALS in 2000, highlighting the need for updated guidelines. Individuals with Huntington's Disease experience cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation. There is a need to revise the medical and evaluation criteria used by the Social Security Administration for determining disability. The 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage should be removed for these individuals, similar to the exemption for ALS patients. The medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease need to be revised. The Commissioner of Social Security will update the medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease for disability determinations under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act in consultation with relevant medical organizations. The Commissioner of Social Security will update the medical and evaluation criteria for Juvenile Huntington's Disease for disability determinations under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act by amending the Listing of Impairments. The term \"Listing of Impairments\" refers to appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease (HD), effective immediately after the enactment of the Act."
