The \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" acknowledges the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among nurses and nursing assistants due to patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning. This leads to chronic back pain and high rates of nurses leaving the profession. Patient safety is also compromised as a result. Patients can benefit from the use of assistive patient handling technology, equipment, and devices to improve safety during lifting, transferring, and repositioning. This technology has reduced injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers, leading to fewer lost work days and lower staff turnover rates. Studies have shown that assistive patient handling technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Some States have implemented safe patient handling standards, demonstrating their success. Establishing these standards for healthcare workers is critical for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The text chunk discusses the Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard, which is crucial for protecting healthcare workers' health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard mandates the use of engineering controls to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including registered nurses. It requires the development of a comprehensive program utilizing mechanical technology to reduce manual handling injuries. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard requires healthcare employers to implement a program using mechanical technology to reduce manual handling injuries. It also mandates the purchase of technology and equipment within 2 years to minimize the risk of injury to nurses and healthcare workers. The final standard mandates healthcare employers to purchase, use, and maintain safe patient handling equipment and technology as determined by the Secretary. Employers must involve healthcare workers in developing and implementing the program, including purchasing necessary equipment. Additionally, employers are required to establish a data tracking and review program to analyze the implementation of safe patient handling measures. The health care employers must incorporate safe patient handling technology into facilities and provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, equipment, and devices. Training should be conducted initially and on a continuing annual basis. Health care employers must ensure that care workers, including lift teams, are trained to identify and control musculoskeletal hazards. Training should be interactive and hands-on, reflecting the specific demands of health care duties. Employers must also post a notice explaining safe patient handling, mobility, injury prevention policies, procedures for reporting injuries, and health care workers' rights under the Act. Annual evaluation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program required for health care employers. Evaluation to include handling procedures, technology selection, injury assessment, and input from nurses and other healthcare workers. Corrective action to be taken based on evaluation recommendations. Right to refuse unsafe assignments also mandated for healthcare workers. The Secretary of Labor conducts unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards. Employees can refuse duties that may violate safety standards if concerns are not addressed by the employer. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in healthcare facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments specify the inclusion of these standards in various subsections and clarify the effective date of implementation. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. States can still enforce laws that provide equal or greater protections for employees. Health care workers' rights are not diminished by this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms related to healthcare workers, including direct-care registered nurse, employee, employment, handling, and health care employer. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to healthcare workers, including health care employer, health care worker, and lift team."
