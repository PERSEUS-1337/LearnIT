    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and exposures. In 1981, Congress passed the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) to provide special authority for the VA to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure. In 1993, P.L. 103-210 granted additional authority for the VA to care for Persian Gulf War veterans with medical conditions linked to toxic substances or environmental hazards. Camp Lejeune, North Carolina's water-supply systems were contaminated with trichloroethylene in the early 1980s. P.L. 112-154 addressed the chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina by providing VA health care services eligibility for certain veterans and their family members stationed there from 1957 to 1987 when the well water was contaminated with TCE and PCE. Eligible individuals can receive medical care for specific illnesses, with the VA being the final payer for eligible individuals. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members with third-party health insurance. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home care facilities. VA provides grants and per diem for veterans in state homes, with eligibility criteria set by VA and management governed by state laws. VA pays full care costs for veterans with 70% service-connected disability or related conditions in VA facilities, but not in State Veterans' Homes. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 equalized nursing home care costs for veterans regardless of the setting. It allowed higher per diem rates for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability in State Veterans' Homes. However, some state veterans' nursing homes reported receiving insufficient reimbursements. P.L. 112-154 now requires the VA to contract with SVHs for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating, with reimbursement methodology developed in consultation with SVHs. The VA is required to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault incidents at medical facilities, as mandated by P.L. 112-154. The Government Accountability Office found numerous unreported sexual assault incidents to the VA police, leading to the need for a centralized management reporting system. This provision aims to ensure proper reporting and tracking of such incidents. The VA is mandated to develop a comprehensive policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault incidents at medical facilities, considering the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant issue in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) due to increased blast injuries and improved survival rates. The VA is required to provide comprehensive care to veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to maximize their independence and improve their behavioral and mental health functioning. Concerns have been raised about the interpretation of the statute, limiting rehabilitative care for individuals with TBI. Section 107 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the inclusion of rehabilitative services in long-term care programs for veterans with TBI in both VA and non-VA facilities. Telehealth, a broader concept than telemedicine, involves the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration. Telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided using communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, psycho-educational interventions, cognitive testing, and general psychiatry. Telemental health, also known as telebehavioral health in the Department of Defense, involves clinicians using technology to provide mental health care to patients remotely. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, offering care to veterans in rural areas. Research shows telehealth is cost-effective and offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment. VA is required to provide remote mental health and TBI assessments through a teleconsultation program. The VA offers training in telemedicine to medical residents without fees. Veterans in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for service-connected conditions. Those with 50% or more disability are exempt from copayments for any condition. Various outpatient services are also copayment-free. Veterans without service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions typically pay copayments of $15 for primary care visits and $50 for other services. The VA offers training in telemedicine to medical residents without fees. Veterans in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for service-connected conditions. Those with 50% or more disability are exempt from copayments for any condition. Veterans without service-connected conditions pay copayments of $15 for primary care visits and $50 for specialty care visits. VA can waive copayments for telehealth consultations. VA is authorized to provide service dogs to veterans with hearing, mobility, or mental impairments. Research is being conducted on the benefits of using service dogs to treat veterans with injuries or disabilities, including PTSD. In 2006, Congress mandated the establishment of an Office of Rural Health (ORH) within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to assist with data collection on rural veterans and reduce disparities in service. The VA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) in FY2009 to develop special practices and products for facilities nationwide. The Centers, located in Maine, Vermont, Florida, Iowa, and Utah, serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 recognizes the VRHRCs that serve veterans. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help with medical service costs. However, it did not allow the VA to keep the third-party payments collected. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. The VA could change its billing basis to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. In FY2004, the Administration consolidated various medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The VA has permanent authority to deposit funds from certain accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. A plan is required to identify and collect billable third-party revenue, including effective billing and collection policies, employee training, revenue goals, and monitoring. Additionally, beneficiary travel payments are provided to eligible veterans. The VA is assessing the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. Mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport are currently provided to eligible veterans and beneficiaries traveling to VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in cases of medical emergency. The VA proposed using Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to save costs, as previous payment methods resulted in overpayment. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services, but the change did not have the desired effect due to limited applicability. The VA proposed using Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to save costs. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. This new reimbursement method applies to all ambulance transportation except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to use the veteran's household income for determining eligibility for health care and makes changes to the Specially Adapted Housing Program, providing grants for veterans with disabilities to purchase or remodel homes. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for mobility impairments and one for blindness or loss of hand use. The dollar limit for the mobility impairment grant is higher than for the blindness grant. The dollar limit for the \u00a72101(a) grant is higher than for the \u00a72101(b) grant, and both types of adapted housing grants are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands the qualifying disabilities for \u00a72101(a) grants to include veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion. The disability must have occurred on or after September 11, 2001, and veterans or servicemembers must be approved for assistance by the end of FY2013. Section 203 of P.L. 112-154 changes the \u00a72101(b) blindness measure to 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lens. Section 204 increases the maximum assistance for \u00a72101(a) grants to $63,780 and for \u00a72101(b) grants to $12,756. The new law, P.L. 112-154, increases the statutory grant limits for adapted housing grants to $63,780 and $12,756. It also allows veterans to use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily. The law increases the maximum Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant limits and adjusts them annually based on a cost-of-construction index. The new law, P.L. 112-154, extends the authority for TRA grants until December 31, 2022. It also provides exceptions to grant limits for veterans or servicemembers whose adapted homes are substantially damaged in a disaster. The maximum benefit is set at the cost to repair or replace the property exceeding insurance coverage or the statutory grant maximums. The VA Loan Guaranty Program is a mortgage insurance program for eligible veterans, where the VA guarantees to pay lenders a portion of losses in case of borrower default. Veterans must occupy the property as their home to be eligible, and fees are based on factors like down payment amount and military service. P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans receiving compensation. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. The disability must meet specific duration requirements, and qualifying spouses are exempt from paying the guaranteed loan fee. Additionally, P.L. 112-154 amends the housing occupancy requirement for the loan guaranty, allowing spouses of veterans called away for active duty to occupy the property as their home. P.L. 112-154 expands VA Loan Guaranty Program to include dependent children of veterans on active duty. It also makes programs for adjustable rate mortgages permanent. The law modifies when veterans with service-connected disabilities can have loan guaranty fees waived, aiming to expedite disability determinations using existing medical evidence. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 extends current loan fees for dwelling unit loans to October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher maximum loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas. The maximum guaranty amount is set at 25% of the higher of the area median home price or the conforming loan limit. The VA's authority to guarantee loans up to 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas is extended through December 31, 2014. Additionally, the VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans is extended through December 31, 2016. The VA's Enhanced-Use Lease (EUL) program allows properties to be used for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Prior EULs had various purposes such as child development centers, parking facilities, and golf courses. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are not affected by the new law. The VA's Enhanced-Use Lease (EUL) program allows properties to be used for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are not affected by the new law. The VA does not have to receive consideration for an EUL, but if it does, it must be \"cash at fair value.\" Each year, the VA releases a report on consideration received for EULs, including recommendations from a VA Inspector General's report. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes grants for services and transitional housing for homeless veterans. Grants are for facility purchase, rehabilitation, or conversion, while per diem reimburses costs for housing and supportive services. Grantees are reimbursed up to the current per diem rate for care provided. The current per diem rate for domiciliary care is $38.90 per day, with the option to use Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) in conjunction with VA Grant and Per Diem funding. P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA Grant and Per Diem program at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for each subsequent fiscal year, allowing grantees to receive funds from other public and private sources as long as the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization. In 2001, Congress created a Grant and Per Diem program to target homeless veterans with special needs. P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the program to include male veterans with dependent children, eliminates certain requirements for grantees, allows funds to be used for services to dependents of homeless veterans, and extends the authorization level for the Special Needs grant. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program provides outreach, care, treatment, and referrals for homeless veterans with medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders. P.L. 112-154 makes homeless veterans eligible for the HCHV program. The HCHV program, in collaboration with HUD-VASH, provides housing vouchers for homeless veterans with case management services. The VA may contract with other entities to assist veterans in finding suitable housing and connecting them with services. This is done in cases where affordable housing is scarce, veterans live far from VA facilities, or have difficulty obtaining housing compared to others in the HUD-VASH program. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends authorization for programs aiding homeless veterans, including the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). HVRP helps veterans find employment, authorized at $50 million per year through FY2013. SSVF assists low-income veterans and families with housing transitions, authorized at $300 million for FY2013. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational benefits to eligible individuals. Section 401 of P.L. 112-154 allows eligible individuals to combine GI Bill programs for up to 81 months of entitlement starting October 1, 2013. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance to servicemembers and veterans post-9/11, while the MGIB-AD program assists eligible Armed Forces members. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 mandates annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA starting from November 13, 2013, through January 1, 2021. The report must include information on the impact of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits on recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces, cost coverage for education, necessity for future recruitment, active duty eligibility requirements, program usage, expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for changes. Section 402 repeals biennial reporting requirements for the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing benefit decisions can submit additional evidence for review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, the local VA office's initial review of newly submitted evidence will be automatically waived unless the claimant requests it. If no request is made, the BVA will review the evidence. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 allows court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement in gathering private medical records if there is enough evidence for maximum benefits. It also encourages claimants to submit relevant records to prevent unnecessary resource expenditure. Section 507 clarifies that if a veteran receiving benefits dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits for the entire month. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims and how the VA can assist in gathering information. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 removes the requirement for the VCAA notice to be sent only after a claim is filed, allowing it to be printed on claims forms. The VA has developed the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process to expedite disability claims, allowing for notification through electronic means and waiving VCAA requirements in certain cases. The effective date of a claim is typically when the VA receives the application, but for FDC claims, it can be up to one year before. Veterans can file a notice under the FDC process to indicate their intent to file a claim. The FDC process allows veterans to establish an effective date for their claim while developing evidence to support it. This change in effective date is only available for three years for original claims received before August 7, 2015. A joint application form for VA survivor benefits and Social Security is required by law, but Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 permits rather than requires the development of this form. Any document indicating an intent to apply for survivor benefits with either agency is considered an application for both VA and SSA. The Improved Disability Pension program provides a monthly cash benefit. The Improved Disability Pension program provides a monthly cash benefit to low-income elderly or totally disabled veterans with active military service during a period of war. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for a married couple when both are veterans and require regular aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is increased to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the maximum cash benefit amount. Reimbursements for casualty losses are excluded from income calculations. Section 509 of P.L. 112-154 expands this exclusion to include reimbursements for expenses for replacement or repair of equipment, vehicles, items, money, or property. The VA provides financial assistance to disabled veterans for purchasing automobiles or adaptive equipment. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows assistance for a second automobile if the first one was destroyed by a disaster. The VR&E Program offers employment services for veterans with disabilities, with provisions for independent living services. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands VR&E benefits for veterans affected by disasters. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 extends subsistence allowance for veterans in the VR&E program for two months post-program completion, with an additional two months for those displaced by disasters. It also waives the annual participation limit for veterans affected by disasters. The law also imposes stricter restrictions on public demonstrations at veterans' funerals. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 imposes restrictions on demonstrations at Arlington National Cemetery and other VA-controlled cemeteries during funerals, with increased minimum distance requirements and statutory damages for violations. Section 602 codifies regulations prohibiting the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President able to waive this prohibition. Notification to relevant committees is required if the President exercises this authority. The Secretary of the Army can establish monuments in Arlington National Cemetery to honor veterans and servicemembers missing in action. Monuments in memory of individuals or military events must wait 25 years after service, but this requirement can be waived. Nongovernmental entities can sponsor monuments after providing an independent study and consulting with relevant committees. The Secretary of the Army can establish monuments in Arlington National Cemetery to honor veterans and servicemembers missing in action. Monuments must wait 25 years after service, but this requirement can be waived. The VA provides a certificate with the President's signature to eligible survivors of deceased veterans discharged under honorable conditions. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the Presidential Memorial Certificate to persons who die in active military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act provides protections for servicemembers facing financial obligations due to military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers facing financial obligations due to military service, including suspending civil claims, protecting against eviction, capping interest rates, and prohibiting cancellation of insurance policies. The SCRA has been amended multiple times since its passage in 2003, with the most recent extension related to mortgages and foreclosures until December 31, 2014. Section 303 of the SCRA has been amended to protect servicemembers who are unable to make mortgage payments due to military service. It prevents vendors from taking action to rescind or terminate contracts, seize property, or breach terms until one year after active duty ends. Sales, foreclosures, or seizures during military service or one year after are prohibited without a court order or agreement. The Comptroller General must report on these protections to Congress within 540 days. Section 703 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA Secretary to report within 180 days on evaluating and training VBA employees processing disability claims. Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits Act grants special contracting preferences to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. Eligibility is limited to firms listed in a VA database, with penalties for misrepresentation. Owners who misrepresent their status as veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are subject to debarment from government contracting for a minimum of five years, as clarified by Section 706 of P.L. 112-154. This debarment is only imposed in cases of willful and intentional misrepresentation, unlike prior law which allowed for inadvertent or unintentional misrepresentation. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 mandates a minimum five-year debarment for owners who willfully misrepresent their status as veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The VA must initiate debarment proceedings within 30 days of such determination and complete them within 90 days. Additionally, all principals of debarred firms are included in the debarment for the same period. Section 707 requires the VA Secretary to report on conferences costing $20,000 or more with 50 or more attendees within 30 days of each fiscal quarter. Under current law, federal contractors and subcontractors with contracts over $100,000 must report annually to the Department of Labor on their employment of veterans. The DOL Secretary is required to maintain a website for public disclosure of this information. Additionally, the VA Secretary is directed to establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
