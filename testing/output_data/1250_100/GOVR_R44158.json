    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure and environmental impacts. Irrigation water use is measured by withdrawals and consumption, with the latter referring to water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Since the 1980s, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop from 2005 to 2010. However, it is uncertain if this decline in withdrawals has led to reduced water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003. In contrast, several eastern states have significantly increased irrigated acres, with a shift from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation observed in 17 western states. The shift from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation has been pronounced in 17 western states. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres from 1984 to 2013, while applied irrigation water declined by over 1.37 million acre-feet. Despite an overall decline in irrigation withdrawals, groundwater withdrawals have increased in the West. In contrast, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres since 1984, with groundwater withdrawals being the primary source for irrigation. Groundwater withdrawals have been the main source for irrigation in eastern states, peaking in 2008 with a 4.3 million AF increase since 2003. This rise is due to factors like increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and easy access to groundwater. However, this increased use of groundwater has led to aquifer depletion and environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency is defined as the beneficial use of applied water without losses to evaporation or seepage. Factors affecting efficiency include irrigation system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response. Evapotranspiration rates, influenced by climate conditions, determine crop water requirements. Efficient irrigation systems are crucial for crop production and water conservation. Water conveyance systems play a significant role in irrigation efficiency, with poorly constructed canals leading to conveyance losses. While efficient systems aim to save water for downstream use, studies suggest that they may actually increase water consumption in some cases. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter typically consumes less water due to water return to surface or groundwater. Efficient irrigation systems aim to save water for downstream use, but may increase water consumption by encouraging farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure and gravity systems, with precision technologies increasingly being used to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Modern irrigation systems are increasingly common and focus on best management practices (BMPs) for water management on farms. BMPs include improved conveyance, scheduling, and application methods based on practices identified by USDA's NRCS. Pressure systems pump water through tubing or pipes for application through sprinklers or microirrigation. Success of BMPs depends on various factors and may require multiple practices. Pressure irrigation systems, such as center pivot and drip systems, are the most common in the United States, making up 58-65% of irrigation systems. These systems are efficient but have high initial costs. An irrigation water management plan is essential to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, and increase water efficiency. This plan may include various BMPs like microirrigation, sprinkler systems, and land leveling. Sprinkler systems, including center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation, spray water over crops for soil moisture. They also provide crop cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Microirrigation, like surface drip and sub-surface drip, is more efficient than sprinkler systems as it applies water directly to crop roots. LEPA systems enhance center pivot irrigation by reducing evaporation losses and energy consumption. Gravity systems flood crops via canals and ditches, making up 35-42% of US irrigation systems. Gravity irrigation systems use land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows to flood crop areas. These systems are less efficient than pressure systems and are suited for close-growing crops like rice. Land leveling reshapes fields to ensure uniform water application, reduce erosion, and prevent water logging. Irrigation ditch lining is commonly used to deliver water from a source to an irrigation system through permanent channels. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss in canals, ditches, and laterals. It can be made of materials like concrete, PVC, or polypropylene. Tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination. Irrigation reservoirs store water for irrigation, with the size depending on water availability. Precision technologies are increasingly used in agriculture. The integration of precision technologies in agriculture, particularly in irrigation, has seen rapid growth. Technologies like satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones enhance irrigation efficiency, reduce costs, and boost crop yields. Technology companies are now offering services to help farmers maximize profits. A collaborative project between NASA and USDA launched the SMAP satellite to gather global soil moisture data, aiding in informed irrigation decisions. Drones are also utilized for aerial imagery and data collection in agriculture. Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) are used for aerial imagery and data collection in agriculture. Sensor networks monitor plant water status and soil water content. Data analytics utilizes real-time data to improve irrigation decisions. Information from weather networks helps establish accurate irrigation schedules. Remote monitoring systems transfer real-time information to adjust irrigation operations. Poly-pipe is used in furrow irrigation. Poly-pipe, a flexible plastic pipe made from polyethylene resins, is used in furrow irrigation. Computer software optimizes hole sizes in poly-pipe to reduce water usage and runoff. Implementing irrigation BMPs increases efficiency, reduces production costs, and ensures even watering. Irrigation allows for higher yields, growth of high-value crops, and extended growing seasons. BMPs can enhance production of specialty crops by delivering water only when needed, preventing issues from overwatering. Irrigation systems can also be used for applying nutrients and pesticides. Efficient irrigation systems can reduce costs and provide more precise application of nutrients and pesticides. Implementation choices for irrigation technologies in the United States are influenced by factors such as cost, crop type, climate, and water availability. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems is often driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation. Growers of high-value crops are more likely to invest in costly irrigation systems, while growers of low-value crops may struggle to finance system improvements. Cost considerations play a significant role in the adoption of efficient irrigation systems. Factors such as financing improvements, installation costs, and developing a water supply impact producers' decisions. High-efficiency systems can be more costly than gravity systems, with groundwater supply development costs influencing the choice of irrigation system. Growers in drought-prone areas relying on surface water are more likely to invest in efficient pressure systems, while areas with abundant surface water may find gravity irrigation more economically feasible. Recent survey data shows that many farmers in the United States are unable to adopt more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, physical field conditions, and concerns about reduced crop yields or poorer quality. Local climate conditions also play a role in limiting irrigation technology adoption, with factors such as wind affecting the effectiveness of different irrigation methods. In arid climates, sprinkler irrigation is subject to high evaporation rates, while subsurface irrigation can lead to soil salinity issues. Soil type, climate conditions, and labor-technology trade-offs influence the choice of irrigation system. Soil surveys help in system design. Gravity irrigation is labor-intensive but suitable for clay soils, while sandy soils require sprinkler or microirrigation. Pressure systems like sprinklers and drip irrigation require technical knowledge. The choice of irrigation system is influenced by soil type, climate conditions, and labor-technology trade-offs. Water quality and quantity can also limit irrigation options. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns, while state water rights laws determine water availability for farmers. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not discussed in detail in this report. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for irrigation BMPs adoption through various USDA agencies and conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. Between 2009 and 2014, $1.2 billion in funding was awarded for irrigation BMPs, with a significant portion going towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West received the highest amount of funding for irrigation BMPs. The majority of states receiving the highest funding for irrigation BMPs are in the West, with California and Texas receiving the most. Three southeastern states are also in the top 10. Groundwater depletion is a concern, with certain aquifers being depleted at unsustainable rates. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce groundwater depletion. EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs, including Conservation Activity Plans and Conservation Innovation Grants. The USDA provides funding for irrigation projects through various programs like EQIP, CAPs, CSP, and AMA. These programs fund irrigation BMPs and promote the adoption of irrigation technologies. Technical assistance is also provided to help farmers implement these practices. The USDA provides technical assistance for irrigation projects through programs like Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), which helps irrigators adopt conservation plans. CTA does not offer financial assistance but can lead to qualifying for other programs. USDA also provides information resources through agencies like ARS, ERS, and NIFA. The USDA's ARS, ERS, and NIFA are key agencies conducting research and providing economic information on irrigation in the United States. Recent studies by ARS focus on improving irrigation management, while ERS examines characteristics of irrigated farms and water conservation trends. NIFA administers funding for agriculture-related research, including programs like AFRI Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and NWQP. National monitoring efforts for irrigation are limited, with NASS and USGS providing the most comprehensive national data on irrigation water use. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) provide comprehensive national data on irrigation water use. NASS conducts surveys of producers every five years, while USGS assesses water use trends, including irrigation, typically released every five years. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) funds irrigation practices like sprinkler systems. Irrigation systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for soil moisture. Sprinkler systems also provide crop cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Other components include microirrigation, irrigation pipeline, pumping plant, irrigation land leveling, and water well extraction. In planning irrigation systems, considerations for impacts on cultural, archaeological, or scientific resources near the site should be evaluated. Structures for water control include flashboard risers, check dams, division boxes, and water measurement devices. Irrigation reservoirs are built to provide a reliable water supply for irrigation, and efficient irrigation water management involves planning volume frequency and application rate. Irrigation systems involve earthwork, pipelines, and water-control structures to convey water while reducing water loss and erosion. A lining made of impervious material can be installed in irrigation ditches. Irrigation Ditch Lining \u2014 Code 428.

Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) offers funding for irrigation practices. Regional Weather Networks aid in irrigation scheduling by tracking crop evapotranspiration. Irrigation System Automation adjusts water application rates based on field conditions. Irrigation Pumping Plant Evaluation enhances energy efficiency and reduces water consumption. Remote Monitoring Notification is also available. Modifications to reduce energy consumption and water use include a remote monitoring notification system for irrigation pumping plants, decreasing irrigation water quantity, mulching for moisture conservation, high-level irrigation water management, and center pivot irrigation system end gun removal. These practices aim to conserve water supplies, reduce energy use, and improve irrigation efficiency. The curr_chunk discusses various irrigation techniques and practices to improve water conservation and irrigation efficiency. This includes converting standard center pivot systems to low energy precision application (LEPA) systems, optimizing hole sizes for poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, intermittent flooding of rice fields, and implementing resource-conserving crop rotation. These methods aim to reduce water usage, improve soil fertility, and enhance overall irrigation practices. Improved Resource Conserving Crop Rotation (CCR98) enhances the previous rotation to further reduce erosion, improve soil fertility, interfere with pest cycles, and reduce soil moisture depletion and water application.
