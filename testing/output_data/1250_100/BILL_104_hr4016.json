    "content": "The \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include State Grants for Drug and Violence Prevention Programs. This includes reservations and allotments for these programs. The \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" reserves funds for specific programs, including grants to Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, programs for Indian youth, a national impact evaluation, and programs for Native Hawaiians. State allotments are allocated based on specific criteria. The allocation of funds to States under the \"Drug-Free Schools Reform Act of 1996\" is determined based on the school-aged population of each State, the amount received under part A of title I for the preceding year, and a minimum allotment requirement. The Secretary may reallot funds if a State cannot utilize them within two years. The term 'State' refers to each of the 50 States. The term 'State' in the context refers to each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The term 'local educational agency' includes educational service agencies and consortia of such agencies. \"State applications are addressed in SEC. 4112.\" The chief executive officer of the State must submit an application to the Secretary to receive funding under section 4111. The application must describe how funds will be coordinated with other programs, provide results of the State's needs assessment for drug and violence prevention programs, assure cooperation with national impact evaluations, and include any other required information. The Secretary will use a peer review process to review State applications. \"State programs under SEC. 4113 require the chief executive officer to submit an application to the Secretary for funding, detailing coordination with other programs, results of needs assessment, cooperation with national evaluations, and any other necessary information.\" The chief executive officer of a State must use allocated funds for drug and violence prevention programs. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of the total amount received. Grants are meant for prevention or education programs focused on the dangers of drug use and underage drinking. Funds must be used exclusively for a 'no use,' 'right-wrong' antidrug message. The chief executive officer must ensure that funds allocated for drug and violence prevention programs are used appropriately. Any expenditures for purposes other than anti-drug programs will be considered a violation, with penalties for misapplication of funds. Grants awarded under this subsection will undergo a peer review process, and the CEO may carry out activities directly or through grants. Additionally, funds can be used to award grants to law enforcement agencies for drug abuse and violence prevention activities. Prevention activities for drug and alcohol abuse include programs like Drug Abuse Resistance Education, Project Legal Lives, partnerships between law enforcement and child guidance professionals, and before- and after-school activities. \"SEC. 4114. EVALUATION AND REPORTING.\" The Secretary conducts a biennial evaluation of national impact of programs combating violence in schools, collecting data on violence frequency and seriousness in elementary and secondary schools. A report with recommendations is submitted to the President and Congress. The State chief executive officer must submit a report to the Secretary every third year on the implementation and effectiveness of State programs under section 4113, including data on drug use and violence by youth in schools and communities. The report must be in a specified form, based on ongoing evaluation activities, and made available to the public. The Secretary will provide grants to organizations serving Native Hawaiians recognized by the Governor of Hawaii to administer programs for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. The term 'Native Hawaiian' refers to individuals whose ancestors were natives of Hawaii before 1778."
