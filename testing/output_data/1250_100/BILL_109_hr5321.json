The \"Access to Better Choice in Dialysis Act of 2006\" mandates a 5-year Medicare pilot project to assess the impact of increasing payment for hemodialysis treatment beyond 3 times per week. The project includes payment increases for additional sessions, with varying percentages of the full composite rate. The pilot program for hemodialysis treatment includes funding limitations of $15,000,000 in the first year, $30,000,000 in the second year, $50,000,000 in the third year, $75,000,000 in the fourth year, and $90,000,000 in the fifth year. Expenditures for hemodialysis treatment will cease after the fifth year. Funds from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund will be used to meet obligations of the pilot program. The Secretary will collect data to measure the impact of higher frequency hemodialysis treatments on health status, healthcare utilization, working status, and financial aspects. Reports on the pilot program will be submitted to Congress periodically. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission on the pilot program's impact, including findings on the clinical and financial effects of more frequent hemodialysis treatment. The Commission will evaluate the Secretary's findings and assess the desirability of expanded Medicare payment for such treatment. Definitions include the full composite rate and hemodialysis treatment. The term \"treatment\" refers to therapy with blood access, excluding emergency or acute care. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
