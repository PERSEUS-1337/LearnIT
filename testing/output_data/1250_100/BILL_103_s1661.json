    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use increases worker exposure to workplace injuries and illnesses. The absence of Federal standards leaves questions about the adequacy of warnings to be determined by inconsistent State requirements, placing a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and preempting any conflicting State standards. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to include a new subsection requiring the Secretary, in consultation with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Personal protective equipment includes gear for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract protection in the workplace. Warnings are statements directing actions or procedures related to the use of such equipment. Each standard issued for personal protective equipment shall prescribe warnings and how they should be communicated to employers and employees. Employers are required to train employees on the proper use of the equipment, the relevance of each warning in their workplace, and the consequences of not following the warnings. The standards become effective 6 months after issuance. The standards for personal protective equipment include warnings that must be communicated to employers and employees. Manufacturers must consider factors like the effectiveness of warnings and means of communication when implementing these standards. The standards become effective 6 months after issuance. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 and Section 18 of the U.S. Code are amended to clarify that occupational safety and health standards for personal protective equipment must be regulated at the federal level, preempting any conflicting state laws or regulations. The amendment clarifies that personal protective equipment standards must be regulated at the federal level, preempting conflicting state laws."
