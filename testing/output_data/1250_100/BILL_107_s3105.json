    "content": "The Act is titled the \"West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act\" and includes a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. The Secretary may make grants to States for prevention and control, with preference given to states with substantial incidence or prevalence of the diseases. Funds under the grant are for developing mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases. States must provide assurances for matching funds to be eligible for the grant. The State must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to at least 50% of the program costs under the grant, which can be in cash or in kind. Federal contributions or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be included in the non-Federal contributions. The grant funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, existing funds for mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases. The grant funds under this subsection must supplement, not supplant, State and local funds for mosquito control plans. The Secretary may waive requirements for a State under extraordinary economic conditions. States receiving funds should involve localities in planning and ensure 85% of the grant is spent at the local level for public health improvement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can use funds to provide technical assistance to State and local health departments for mosquito control programs and containment of arboviral diseases. The Secretary, in consultation with public and private health entities, may develop mosquito abatement guidelines. The plan developed in consultation with health organizations aims to guide State and local communities in implementing sustainable mosquito control programs. It includes identifying new disease cases, monitoring disease spread in various creatures, providing testing support, enhancing surveillance for arboviruses, and conducting educational outreach campaigns. The program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act includes public outreach campaigns to reduce exposure to arboviruses, appropriate procedures for mosquito control, and evaluation by the Secretary to report to Congress within 18 months. The program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act includes public outreach campaigns, mosquito control procedures, cost-benefit evaluation, authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, and termination on September 30, 2004. The program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act includes public outreach campaigns, mosquito control procedures, cost-benefit evaluation, authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, and may be extended for an additional fiscal year based on evaluation. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section for an Arbovirus Research Program. The President is mandated to expand research on controlling insect populations that transmit diseases like West Nile Virus, develop screening tools, pathogen inactivation technologies, and containment methodologies. Activities may involve examining existing and new control methods and can be carried out by various entities including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health. The President is authorized to promote coordination between relevant Federal agencies, private sector, and individuals with expertise in public health, entomology, arbovirology, and veterinary health. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2003 through 2007."
