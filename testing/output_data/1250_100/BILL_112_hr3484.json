    "content": "The \"Travel Regional Investment Partnership Act\" emphasizes the significance of the travel and tourism industry in the US economy. It highlights the employment opportunities, economic contributions, and challenges faced by the industry. Additionally, it recognizes the potential of public-private partnerships in promoting domestic regional tourism growth. The Secretary will establish a grant program through the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries to promote domestic regional tourism growth. Grants will range from $100,000 to $1,000,000 and can be awarded to State tourism offices, local destination marketing organizations, and partnerships between government and tourism entities. Priority may be given to regions with low tourism marketing contributions, maintaining regional diversity, and benefiting rural destinations. Grants awarded under this section can be used to promote domestic regional tourism growth and create new domestic tourism markets. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary with details of tourist promotion activities and partnerships with local tourism entities. The grant recipient must provide non-Federal matching funds, either in cash or in-kind, equal to the grant amount. In-kind donations are allowed for the matching funds. Non-Federal matching funds required for grants must not exceed 25% in in-kind contributions. The Secretary must report travel-related expenditures, tax receipts, and employment annually. Definitions include \"local tourist entity\" and \"Secretary.\" $10,000,000 is authorized for grants over the first 5 fiscal years."
