    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To improve the generalization and robustness of compact models, introducing noise at input or supervision levels can be beneficial. Variability through noise can enhance model performance, as seen in experiments like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\". Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising impact on model robustness. The study emphasizes the advantages of incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area. The design of Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment must consider factors like memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. Compact models that generalize well are essential for resource-constrained devices and applications with strict latency requirements, such as self-driving cars. It is crucial to evaluate model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to ensure reliability under distribution shift. Additionally, models need to be resilient to malicious attacks by adversaries. In the study, the focus is on knowledge distillation as a method for training a smaller network under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network. Despite the performance improvement, there is still a gap between the student and teacher models. Capturing knowledge from the larger network and transferring it to a smaller model remains an open question. The goal is to reduce the generalization gap and make these models suitable for real-world deployment. Incorporating methods to improve the robustness of the student model by drawing inspiration from neuroscience on how humans learn. Learning through collaboration, cognitive bias, and trial-to-trial response variation are central to the approach. Human decision-making involves systematic simplifications and deviations from rationality, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Introducing constructive noise in student-teacher collaborative learning can deter cognitive bias and improve learning by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in humans. This noise can enhance model generalization and robustness, leading to more accurate and reliable models. Introducing noise in student-teacher collaborative learning can improve generalization and robustness of the student model. Methods like \"Fickle Teacher\" use Dropout for uncertainty transfer, \"Soft Randomization\" uses Gaussian noise for adversarial robustness, and random label corruption deters cognitive bias while improving robustness. Noise has been used as a regularization technique in deep neural networks to enhance generalization performance. Introducing noise in deep neural networks has been shown to improve generalization and robustness. Various noise techniques, such as Dropout and injection of noise to the gradient, have been proven effective for non-convex optimization. Randomization techniques that inject noise during training and inference time are effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing transforms classifiers into smooth classifiers with certifiable robustness guarantees. Label smoothing enhances network performance but may impair knowledge distillation. Incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation could be a promising direction for achieving lightweight models. In an empirical analysis using CIFAR-10, noise addition in knowledge distillation was studied using the Hinton method. Experiments were conducted on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) with normalization of images. Out of distribution generalization was evaluated using ImageNet from the CINIC dataset, and adversarial robustness was assessed using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). In the context of noise addition in knowledge distillation, a signal-dependent noise is injected into the output logits of the teacher model. The effect of this noise on generalization and robustness is studied, showing improvement in generalization to CIFAR-10 test set while marginally reducing out-of-distribution generalization to CINIC-ImageNet. Our method improves the distillation process by adding noise to the teacher model's softened logits during knowledge transfer to the student. Dropout is used in the teacher model to introduce variability in the supervision signal, leading to different output predictions for the same input. This approach contrasts with previous methods that trained the teacher model with noise. Our method enhances knowledge distillation by incorporating dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for training a compact student model. Unlike previous approaches, we utilize the teacher model's logits with activated dropout to directly capture its uncertainty, resulting in improved generalization and robustness against attacks. Training the student model with dropout significantly enhances both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Our scheme improves generalization and robustness by incorporating dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for training a compact student model. The student model's performance continues to improve even when the teacher model's performance decreases. Adding trial-to-trial variability helps in distilling knowledge to the student model, enhancing both PGD Robustness and natural robustness. Our method proposes adding Gaussian noise in the input image while distilling knowledge to the student model, aiming to balance robustness and generalization. Our method involves using the teacher model trained on clean images to train the student model with random Gaussian noise, aiming to retain adversarial robustness gain and mitigate generalization loss. By minimizing a specific loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, we observed a significant increase in adversarial robustness and a decrease in generalization. Our method outperforms training the compact model with Gaussian noise alone, achieving improvements in both generalization and robustness. Additionally, our method enhances robustness to common corruptions such as noise and blurring. Figure 5 demonstrates improved robustness to noise and blurring corruptions with increasing Gaussian noise intensity. Weather corruptions show enhanced robustness except for fog and frost, while digital corruptions show improvement except for contrast and saturation. Changes in robustness are observed at different intensities, with a proposed regularization technique based on label noise to increase adversarial robustness while minimizing generalization loss. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization by relabeling samples in each epoch. Previous research focused on noisy labels, but not on using random label noise constructively. The study investigates various levels of label corruption on teacher and student models to improve robustness. The study examines the effects of random label corruption on model generalization, showing that knowledge distillation outperforms the teacher model under high label corruption levels. Random label corruption significantly increases adversarial robustness, with a notable improvement even with 5% random labels. This phenomenon warrants further investigation, and the study introduces variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise at input or supervision levels. The study explores the impact of introducing noise at multiple levels on generalization and robustness in model training. Results show that injecting noise, such as random label corruption, significantly improves adversarial robustness and generalization in the knowledge distillation framework. Additionally, using soft randomization enhances adversarial robustness and reduces the drop in generalization, indicating a promising direction for training compact models with improved performance. The method involves using the smooth logits of the teacher model as soft targets for the student model, minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. Neural networks generalize well when test data matches training data, but domain shift can impact generalization. Out-of-distribution performance was measured using ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset. The performance of models trained on CIFAR-10 can approximate out-of-distribution performance. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to research on robustness and defense mechanisms. The Projected Gradient Descent attack is used to evaluate adversarial robustness in this study. The study evaluates adversarial robustness by adding random noise within an epsilon bound to the input image. The model needs to be robust to both adversarial attacks and naturally occurring perturbations. Recent works have shown that Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to real-world perturbations, not just adversarial examples. In their study, Gu et al. (2019) found that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to natural transformations in video frames. They used robustness to synthetic color distortions as a proxy for natural robustness. In our study, we use robustness to common corruptions and perturbations as a proxy for natural robustness. It is important to balance model robustness to adversarial attacks with generalization to in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, as well as natural perturbations and distribution shifts. Recent studies have shown that adversarially trained models can negatively impact natural robustness. In contrast to the negative impact of adversarially trained models on natural robustness, a proposed method involves random swapping noise to improve in-distribution generalization. Two variants are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All, which swap softmax logits based on a threshold difference. These methods aim to enhance model robustness without compromising generalization. Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs to capture the teacher model's uncertainty. Different dropout rates require varying numbers of epochs and learning rate reductions. Noise on teacher supervision can improve student accuracy on unseen data but not out-of-distribution generalization. The curr_chunk contains various types of noise such as impulse noise, shot noise, speckle noise, defocus blur, Gaussian blur, glass blur, motion blur, zoom blur, brightness fog, frost, snow, spatter, contrast, elastic transform, JPEG compression, pixelate, saturate."
