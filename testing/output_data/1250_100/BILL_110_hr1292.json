Congress finds that the United States went to war against Iraq in 2003 without clearly defined political and military goals, inadequate troop levels and strategy, and insufficient armor and equipment, straining the military. The President's justifications for using military force against Iraq, including weapons of mass destruction and links to al Qaeda, have not been proven correct. The end of major combat operations in Iraq marked the start of the occupation phase. The reasons for military action have shifted from combating Saddam Hussein's threat to establishing Iraqi democracy and promoting Middle Eastern democracy. Despite authorization to defend national security, current US troops in Iraq do not face a direct threat. The President's policies of preemption and unilateralism have led to an open-ended occupation of Iraq amidst a civil war. The escalation of military force in Iraq deviates from traditional US policies of diplomacy, deterrence, and containment. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) is repealed. Congress should vote on a new authorization for the use of force resolution reflecting the current situation in Iraq, abandoning the Bush Doctrine of preemption and unilateralism. The United States should establish a quick-reaction military force in the region, enhance diplomatic relations for national reconciliation in Iraq, and engage neighboring countries and the League of Arab States for stability. The United States should maintain its commitment to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq, redirect diplomatic, economic, and military support to Afghanistan, and aggressively pursue terrorist organizations posing a threat to the country."
