Former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili accused President Mikheil Saakashvili of ordering murder, leading to calls for Saakashvili's resignation. Police dispersed demonstrators, resulting in injuries, and shut down the independent Imedi television station. Saakashvili declared a state of emergency, claiming the demonstrations were a Russian-backed coup attempt. International criticism followed the crackdown. Saakashvili stepped down as president on November 25, 2007, influenced by international criticism of the crackdown. Early presidential elections were held on January 5, 2008, to establish a clear mandate. Legislative Speaker Nino Burjanadze became acting president and called for a plebiscite on spring or fall legislative elections and Georgia's NATO membership. Imedi television station resumed broadcasts on December 12, serving as a platform for opposition candidates. Amendments to the electoral code aimed to enhance democracy, but haphazard implementation was noted by the OSCE. During the presidential election in Georgia, Saakashvili and six other candidates were registered. Saakashvili focused on reducing corruption and improving living conditions, while Gachechiladze aimed for a parliamentary system. Gamqrelidze pledged to support freedom of speech and an independent judiciary, Natelashvili aimed to boost social services, and Maisashvili emphasized business creation. During the Georgian presidential election, prominent figures like Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia and Badri Patarkatsishvili advocated for NATO membership and a confederation with Russia, respectively. Patarkatsishvili faced accusations of a coup attempt and campaigned from abroad. The focus of the campaign was on accusations rather than issues, with a notable event being the government's release of recordings incriminating Patarkatsishvili in another coup. He denied the allegations and initially withdrew as a candidate before reversing his decision. During the Georgian presidential election, Saakashvili received enough votes to avoid a second round of voting. Voters endorsed Georgia joining NATO and supported holding legislative elections in spring 2008. The government's attempt to conduct balloting in South Ossetia was denounced. Saakashvili's popularity was boosted by a growing economy and improved social services. Opposition disunity was a significant factor in the election results. The preliminary report by observers from the OSCE, PACE, and EP assessed the Georgian presidential election as mostly consistent with democratic standards, despite significant challenges. Positive aspects included a competitive choice of candidates, while negative aspects involved violations such as government support for Saakashvili, harassment of opposition campaigners, and biased handling of complaints by the CEC. The vote count was viewed more negatively, with many monitors rating it as bad or very bad, attributing electoral abuses to incompetence or local fraud. The Georgian presidential election faced challenges with violations such as government support for Saakashvili, harassment of opposition campaigners, and biased handling of complaints by the CEC. The election results in 18 of 3,511 voting precincts were invalidated or corrected due to irregularities. Observers had mixed opinions on the election, with some suggesting Saakashvili may have won enough votes to avoid a runoff, while others argued that the reported balloting for Saakashvili was inflated. The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the election for not being free and fair, citing the extensive use of administrative resources and pressure on opposition candidates. The relative peacefulness of the election campaign was seen as a positive sign compared to previous violence. Saakashvili's re-election in the Georgian presidential election is seen as a positive sign for democratization and stability. He pledged greater opposition participation in decision-making and analysts believe opposition parties may benefit from increased visibility. The election reassured international investors of a stable investment climate, but increased social spending could lead to short-term inflation. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe urged opposition politicians to show maturity and respect for the democratic process. Saakashvili's electoral victory in Georgia's presidential election is seen as a positive sign for democratization and stability. Despite concerns of electoral irregularities, thousands peacefully protested against the perceived fraudulent election. Public trust in Saakashvili's governance has declined, with some arguing that fear of disorder led to his win. The risk of further unrest looms if trust continues to erode, impacting the upcoming legislative election. Saakashvili's win dealt a blow to Russia's hopes of restoring influence in Georgia. Saakashvili's re-election in Georgia is seen as a positive sign for democratization and stability, despite concerns of electoral irregularities.

The U.S. State Department welcomed his call for early elections and urged him to relinquish emergency powers for a free and fair election. Saakashvili's victory dealt a blow to Russia's hopes of regaining influence in Georgia. The U.S. State Department, led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, emphasized the importance of democratic reform in Georgia. They urged government and opposition politicians to work together for democratic progress and reiterated support for Georgia's NATO aspirations. NATO's consideration of a Membership Action Plan for Georgia may be delayed pending the country's performance in the upcoming legislative election. After the January 5 election in Georgia, the State Department congratulated the people for a mostly consistent election but raised concerns about reported violations. The U.S. ambassador refrained from an official political assessment, but President Bush later congratulated Saakashvili. Some opposition supporters criticized the U.S. for recognizing Saakashvili's win, leading to a protest at the U.S. Embassy. Despite this, many in Congress have long supported democratization and assistance to Georgia. The 110th Congress urged NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan for Georgia and designated Georgia as eligible for security assistance. Senator Richard Lugar introduced a resolution urging free and fair elections in Georgia, emphasizing the importance of returning to the democratic path. Representative Alcee Hastings led a mission of short-term observers to monitor the January 5 election, viewing it as a viable expression of free choice. The 110th Congress supported NATO extending a Membership Action Plan for Georgia and designated Georgia for security assistance. Senator Richard Lugar emphasized the importance of free and fair elections in Georgia. Former Representative Jim Kolbe led a delegation that viewed the election as broadly free and fair but called for further reforms due to societal mistrust and polarization."
