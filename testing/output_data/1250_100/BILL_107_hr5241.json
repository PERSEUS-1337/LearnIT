    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with various health conditions, including children with chronic illnesses and disabilities, those living with relatives due to parental incapacity, and individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities. Additionally, a significant portion of the elderly population experiences multiple chronic disabling conditions. Approximately 600,000 Americans die at home annually, relying on extensive family caregiving before their deaths. 42 percent of individuals needing daily assistance in the US are under 65, with insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers. The cost of replacing family caregivers with paid services would be around $200 billion yearly. Family caregivers, mainly women, face emotional, physical, and financial hardships, often struggling to find information on available respite care programs. The text discusses the insufficiency of available respite care programs for family caregivers, particularly those caring for the elderly. The purpose of the title is to encourage the establishment of state and local respite care programs, improve information dissemination to caregivers, and enhance respite care services. It aims to promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery, worker recruitment, and caregiver training. The text discusses the need for training programs for family caregivers to make informed decisions about respite care services. It also mentions supporting research to identify effective respite care services and promoting the dissemination of results and findings related to respite care delivery and caregiver training. \"SEC. 2802.

An 'eligible recipient' refers to a State agency or any other public entity capable of receiving assistance. The term 'family caregiver' refers to an unpaid family member, foster parent, or another unpaid adult providing in-home care for a child or adult with special needs. Eligible recipients of assistance include public entities, nonprofit organizations, political subdivisions with a population of at least 3,000,000, and recognized State respite coordinating agencies with demonstrated abilities in respite care and family caregiver issues.

Lifespan respite care grants and cooperative agreements.\" The section aims to expand respite care services for family caregivers, improve dissemination and coordination, and enhance access and quality of services to reduce caregiver strain. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible recipients for this purpose. Coordination of respite care services across different agencies is emphasized. Application procedures are outlined for potential recipients. The section outlines the application process for eligible recipients seeking grants for respite care services.
