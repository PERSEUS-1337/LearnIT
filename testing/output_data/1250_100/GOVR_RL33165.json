    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, including market-oriented mechanisms. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal was compared to bills by Senator Jeffords and Senator Carper, with the Administration initially reluctant to conduct the study. The Clear Skies bill failed to advance due to concerns about its provisions compared to the other bills. The concern was raised about the lack of analysis comparing the Clear Skies bill to other Senate bills. Electric utility generating facilities emit pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Carbon dioxide emissions may contribute to global warming. EPA has regulations for some pollutants, with declining emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Emissions from fossil-fuel electric generating plants in the US have decreased for SO2 and NOx due to regulations, but CO2 emissions continue to rise. In 2003, these plants accounted for a significant portion of the country's emissions. Additional controls are being implemented for pollutants like NOx, SO2, and Hg. The United States has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol in favor of a voluntary reduction program. The Senate passed a resolution for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases in 2005. A \"multi-pollutant\" approach is being considered to regulate utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2. This approach aims to balance environmental goals with industry stability. The new approach to regulating emissions has been incorporated into existing law with rules like the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), and Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR). More reductions in SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions are needed due to new ambient air quality standards. Mercury emissions are a significant concern as they affect water bodies and fish consumption advisories have been issued in 44 states. In the 109th Congress, legislation addressing power plant pollution through multi-pollutant controls, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions, was introduced. The proposed bills aim for a 70% to 80% reduction in NOx and SO2 emissions from 1998 levels, with some including CO2 caps. Key questions in the debate include the stringency of the caps, the timeline for reductions, and whether CO2 should be capped. The legislation would rely on a system of tradeable allowances similar to the acid rain program. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) aims to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions by 70%-90% from 1998 levels, with a phased implementation over a long period. The bill includes \"banking\" provisions that allow utilities to overcomply in early years and use credits for later emission reductions. EPA projects full 70% emission reductions may not be achieved until 2026. The Clear Skies bill aims to reduce NOx and SO2 emissions by 70%-90% from 1998 levels, with full 70% reductions not expected until 2026 or later. The Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier and more stringent caps on emissions, allowing utilities to reach compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, leading to different compliance strategies compared to the other bills. EPA's cost-benefit analysis shows little difference between the Clear Skies options and alternatives proposed by Senators Carper and Jeffords. The EPA's analysis shows little difference between the four Clear Skies options, suggesting they can be considered as one for most purposes. The discussion is simplified to three main choices: Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The EPA chose the Managers' Mark version of Clear Skies as the baseline for their Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis. Despite three finalized rules by EPA on SO2, NOx, and Hg, they were not included in the baseline. Instead, EPA designated them as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling pollutants. This report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case for its baseline. The report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as a baseline for clean air regulation analysis. Uncertainties exist regarding future legislation and regulations, emphasizing the need for updated baseline projections. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity. Electric Demand Price Elasticity (Demand Response). EPA analyzes scenarios with zero price elasticity and very inelastic short-term price elasticity. Assumed Short-term Construction Constraints (Feasibility). EPA considers scenarios with a shortage in boilermaker labor and timely market response for new equipment. Assumed Electricity Demand Growth and Natural Gas Supply. EPA compares scenarios with different annual electricity demand growth rates and natural gas prices. EPA developed four scenarios based on these parameters. EPA developed four scenarios based on parameters including price elasticity, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply. The scenarios range from zero price elasticity to very inelastic short-term price elasticity, with different assumptions on construction constraints and energy supply. The Demand Response Scenario is chosen as the benchmark analysis, considering a compromise between factors and lack of alternative combinations. Each scenario raises questions, but including a short-term demand response function in the modeling is argued to be the strongest case. The EPA developed four scenarios based on parameters like price elasticity, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply. The Demand Response Scenario includes a short-term demand response function in the modeling, which is considered the strongest case. EPA's assumption about boilermaker labor in three scenarios has been questioned by some, including the Institute of Clean Air Companies. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) found no constraint on construction for air pollution control equipment installations. They stated that resources for projected installations under the IAQR will not be limiting, citing examples of successful installations in Germany and Japan. Factors like modular construction methods and non-union craft labor will reduce demand for union boilermakers, further alleviating potential shortages. The availability of boilermaker labor will not be a constraint for the projected IAQR and control installation for 2010 and 2015. Additional labor can be sourced from various unions and labor pools if needed. Despite some assumptions and constraints in EPA scenarios, it is more important to include a demand elasticity function in the analysis. EPA's demand response scenario was chosen as the base for the analysis. The analysis uses EPA's demand response scenario as the basis for discussion, considering the uncertainty of future natural gas supply and the importance of sensitivity analysis to understand cost estimates. EPA's supply curves project more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's curves, which may be more representative of future supplies. However, the volatility of the natural gas market and the 15-year timeframe leave room for debate. The Demand Response Scenario is justified for the analysis, including a short-term demand function. Clear Skies bill costs less than other bills in both short- and long-term. It has weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. Clear Skies aims to revamp the Clean Air Act for cost-effectiveness. Its benefits are lower compared to Carper and Jeffords bills. In 2010, Clear Skies would provide $6 billion in annual benefits, while Carper and Jeffords bills offer $51 billion and $83 billion respectively. According to the EPA, Clear Skies bill has lower benefits compared to Carper and Jeffords bills due to less stringent pollution caps and a more relaxed implementation schedule. When compared to current Clean Air Act requirements, Clear Skies has minimal incremental costs and benefits, suggesting successful incorporation of market-based regulations. Opponents argue that current law requirements are as effective as Clear Skies. Senator Jeffords' bill, S. 150, is shown to have the greatest benefits compared to other proposals. In 2010, its benefits would be $83 billion annually, surpassing the Carper bill by $32 billion and Clear Skies by 14 times. By 2020, the benefits of S. 150 would still exceed other bills, estimated at $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. Despite its benefits, S. 150 is also noted to be the most costly bill, with short-term construction constraints impacting the analysis. The EPA predicts that the Jeffords bill (S. 150) would lead to a 40% reduction in coal production and coal-fired electric generation by 2010. This would require a significant increase in renewable energy sources and oil- and gas-fired capacity. Despite being costly, the net benefits of S. 150 far exceed those of Clear Skies and the Carper bill (S. 843). S. 843 aims for substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with a phased-in schedule to avoid immediate price increases. It includes a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce emissions at a low cost. EPA analyzed variables like price elasticity and construction constraints, with the benchmark assuming limited elasticity and constraints. The EPA analyzed three scenarios: No Construction Constraint, EPA Base Case, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints but includes zero demand price elasticity. This has a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, with a 36% short-term and 157% long-term increase. The EPA's analysis of different scenarios for S. 150 shows that removing short-term construction constraints while assuming zero demand price elasticity results in significant cost increases of 36% in the short term and 157% in the long term. This highlights the importance of considering demand response and construction constraints in cost estimates. The EPA's assumptions heavily influence cost estimates for S. 843 in the short term, but have little effect in the long term or for the Managers' Mark. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario combines zero demand response with higher electricity growth and tighter natural gas supply, resulting in higher costs, particularly for S. 150. This puts pressure on EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity, especially for 2020. The EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity has a significant impact on cost estimates for S. 150 in the short and long term. This effect is less pronounced for S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability could help determine appropriate targets for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumptions have little effect on the Managers' Mark cost estimates. The EPA analyzed two bills, S. 150 and S. 843, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 sets a more stringent emissions cap compared to S. 843, resulting in higher costs for CO2 allowances. S. 150 aligns more closely with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. The EPA analyzed S. 150 and S. 843 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 aligns closely with the Kyoto Protocol, resulting in higher costs for CO2 allowances. The estimated cost for carbon dioxide reduction is $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, similar to current EU prices. The analysis may overstate mercury emission control costs due to advancements in technology since 2003. The air pollution control industry states that the cost of activated carbon injection (ACI) controls has decreased significantly. EPA's analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for both S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. Environmental benefits were not monetized in the analysis. The analysis does not monetize environmental benefits of sulfur dioxide and mercury controls, which could have significant impacts on aquatic life, forest growth, and regional haze. Additionally, the analysis does not model mercury health effects, which could range from a few million to several billion dollars per year. This omission has the greatest effect on S. 150 and S. 843, which have more aggressive control schemes. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which may significantly understate the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Jeffords bill is the most aggressive in controlling CO2 emissions. EPA's analysis shows little cost and small benefits for Clear Skies legislation after adjusting for promulgated rules, while the Jeffords and Carper bills have benefits outweighing additional costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on proposed reductions. The analysis of costs for carbon dioxide and mercury control in S. 843 shows nominal reduction costs with relaxed implementation schedules. However, as reduction requirements increase, costs rise. EPA's benefit analysis is limited and incomplete, favoring Clear Skies alternatives by overstating Hg control costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules. The analysis does not consider the impact of natural gas price volatility on implementation strategies and costs. The analysis of costs for carbon dioxide and mercury control in S. 843 is based on 2003 assumptions, which may no longer be up-to-date for congressional debate."
