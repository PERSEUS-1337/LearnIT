Airlines rely on this insurance for loan agreements, lease agreements, and to meet requirements of some foreign countries. After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure coverage for U.S. air carriers when the commercial market was unstable. Private insurers offer war risk coverage for loss or damage to passengers and aircraft hulls in the event of a terrorist attack, but coverage for third-party damage is limited. Airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion in 2011. Insurance prices vary based on factors such as location, size, safety record, and deductible levels. The private market for aviation risk insurance is deemed adequate, but could be impacted by a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers currently provide the majority of aviation insurance. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage for airlines, with the market for aviation coverage outside of war risk being soft in recent years. A series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to increases in aviation insurance premiums. Some insurers estimate premiums could rise by 50%, with war risk insurance potentially tripling. Some insurance company officials caution against predicting price rises for war risk insurance due to lack of major carrier renewals. The 2014 insurance losses may result in higher premiums for all-risk policies. Uncertainty remains on how the commercial market will respond, potentially leading to expensive or unavailable private coverage, especially impacting U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations. EU regulations mandate insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war and terrorism risks, for carriers operating within EU territory. Non-EU carriers overflying EU territory must have insurance for third-party liability. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates war risk insurance for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance was commercially available but with 48-hour cancellation clauses. The Secretary of Commerce was given authority to provide war risk insurance in the interest of air commerce. The Secretary of Commerce was authorized to provide war risk insurance for both U.S.- and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce based on private market analysis. A revolving fund funded through premiums and recoveries was established within the Treasury to cover liabilities. Disputes regarding claims could be settled in federal district court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. In 1966, responsibility for the aviation program was delegated to FAA under the Department of Transportation. The era of international terrorism began with the hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in Rome in 1968 by PFLP members. This was followed by more hijackings in 1969 and 1970, known as the Dawson's Field hijackings. The fate of the Pan Am 747 hijacked on September 6, 1970, in Jordan is relevant for discussing insurance coverage for terrorist acts. The hijackers ordered the plane to Beirut and then Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive. The aircraft was insured under an \"all risk\" policy and war risk policies split between FAA and commercial insurers. This event raised concerns in the insurance industry about covering larger, more costly planes like the Boeing 747. Following terrorist hijackings, federal action was taken to maintain war risk insurance coverage in the Middle East. The FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage due to unavailability at reasonable rates from commercial insurers. The government set the rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, offered on a limited basis as an emergency response to the Middle East crisis. A landmark 1973 federal court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed by hijackers in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not war risk policies. The court defined \"act of war\" as an operation intended to gain a military advantage. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a decision narrowing the definition of war to specify combatants with significant attributes of sovereignty. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were held liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft, as federal aviation war risk insurance was primarily issued without premiums prior to the 9/11 attacks. Premium war risk insurance was a small component of the program. In response to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates during the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, air carriers began cancelling flights to destinations in the Middle East. Insurance premiums for flights to and from Israel increased twentyfold, leading to flight suspensions by Trans World Airlines and Pan Am to high-risk locations. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel, despite FAA not insuring their flights from New York to Tel Aviv after Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers cancelled war risk coverage for airlines, leading Congress to pass the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001. This act expanded coverage to include acts of terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program through December 31, 2003, and it has been extended several times since. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established by P.L. 107-296, expanded coverage to include losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. The program authority expires on September 30, 2014, with rates set to match commercial rates in force on November 25, 2002. The total premium paid by air carriers for the policy cannot exceed twice the premium paid as of June 19, 2002. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established by P.L. 107-296, expanded coverage to include losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. It capped rates to match commercial rates in force on November 25, 2002, and specified coverage from the first dollar of any covered loss. Following the 9/11 attacks, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA, P.L. 107-297) was passed to create a reinsurance program for terrorism losses for most lines of commercial property/casualty insurance. TRIA covers terrorism losses for airlines leaving the FAA program and purchasing commercial insurance. As of January 2014, the FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers representing 99% of total revenue-passenger-miles flown by all U.S. carriers in FY2013. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established by P.L. 107-296, provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers representing 99% of total revenue-passenger-miles flown by all U.S. carriers in FY2013. Insurance coverage ranges from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier, with total maximum per occurrence coverage for all insured air carriers in force in January 2014 at $68 billion. Premiums paid are collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, which had a balance of approximately $2.2 billion as of July 31, 2014. However, declining demand led to 17 U.S. air carriers cancelling their FAA war risk insurance policies in favor of commercial coverage, leaving the FAA currently insuring 27 air carriers estimated to cover approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. Total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. The FAA has reduced its estimate of premiums paid under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program for FY2014 and FY2015. The coverage includes hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability with no deductibles or coinsurance. The program covers various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks, including strikes, riots, civil commotions, hijacking, and malicious acts. It excludes payments for ransom or extortion demands and government seizures for outstanding debts or unlawful acts. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers risks like hijacking, weapon detonation, and unlawful seizures on aircraft. The FAA sets premiums based on risk, with a cap limiting them to twice the amount paid before 2002. The program has a small administrative staff and paid over $10 million in compensation since 9/11, with no claims before that event. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program has paid over $10 million in compensation for losses related to three specific incidents deemed \"war risk occurrences\" by the Secretary of Transportation. These incidents include an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, the seizure of a SkyWest aircraft by a fugitive in 2012, and damage to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft in 2014 caused by gunfire over Afghanistan. Total claims paid to date amount to $9.6 million for the SkyWest incident, $205,600 for the Northwest Airlines incident, and $256,890 for the Boeing 767-223 aircraft. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a legislative reform to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program in 2014, aiming to provide war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and in case of market disruptions. This proposal follows previous changes suggested in the President's FY2014 budget to allow collaboration with commercial insurers for shared-risk coverage. The FAA proposed a shared-risk model with commercial insurers for aviation war risk coverage, aiming for insurers to take on 80% of the risk by FY2018. The airline industry has opposed changes, arguing that commercial insurance would be costly and could lead to service reductions. A4A recommended maintaining the current aviation war risk coverage program for three years to avoid inadequate insurance protection and service reductions. The Secretary of Transportation's proposal to extend the program was not supported due to budgetary concerns, suggesting either increasing premiums or seeking higher returns to reduce costs. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund collected $165 million in premiums in FY2013. Increasing the statutory cap could raise premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies. Insurers invest premiums in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns currently at historical lows. The fund received $26 million in FY2015. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund received $26 million in interest on its $2 billion holding of federal securities in FY2013. Private insurers invest in a wide range of instruments with historically higher returns than U.S. Treasury securities. Private property/casualty insurers earned approximately $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in cash and investments in 2013. Private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities, with policies leaving the insured bearing some risk through deductibles, co-insurance, and exclusions. This risk-sharing discourages behavior changes that may increase the likelihood of a loss, known as \"moral hazard.\" The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program offers coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance, covering losses up to maximum limits. Budgetary savings could be significant by placing more risk on airlines, similar to how private insurers share risks among multiple parties. Reinsurance is often used to spread risk, tailoring contracts for risk sharing. Reinsurance contracts can be tailored for risk sharing between companies, based on expertise and capacity. Loss sharing can be a percentage or at a certain level of loss. Private insurers enter into these arrangements for various reasons, not just financial risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act uses a program structure mixing loss sharing based on level and percentage of loss. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) involves loss sharing where the government covers 85% of losses once they reach 20% of an insurer's premiums. The program was intended to expire quickly with the government's share of losses decreasing over time, but it has been reauthorized with a more gradual decrease. Improved international guidance on risk decisions in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance premiums. After the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in 2014, there is increased interest in making informed decisions on civilian flight operations in high-risk regions. Insurance underwriters are considering continued coverage for aircraft in certain areas. Insurance underwriters are reviewing coverage for aircraft in conflict zones, requiring more details on flight routes. Concerns have been raised about airlines' risk assessment practices, especially after the Malaysia Airlines crash. The International Civil Aviation Organization has convened a task force to assess conflict zone risks more collaboratively. In conflict zones, countries may not always share information on risks to civil aviation or take necessary precautions, as it could impact travel and tourism. Aviation authorities like the FAA may issue warnings or restrictions on flights, leading to differing views on risk management among regulators, airlines, and insurers. For example, in July 2014, FAA restricted flights to and from Israel briefly during an armed conflict, prompting international airlines to suspend service, but Israeli authorities requested resumption of flights. Israeli authorities are asking international air carriers to resume flights despite risks to civil aircraft being mitigated. This highlights the reluctance of governments to disseminate warnings that may impact travel and tourism. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards could reduce uncertainties in risk assessment. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires air carriers to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war and terrorism. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates minimum insurance coverage for aviation liability, including passenger, baggage, cargo, and third-party liability. The minimum coverage varies based on the type of operation and aircraft weight, ranging from 100,000 SDRs to 700 million SDRs per accident. Sanctions for regulation infringement must be effective and proportional. Sanctions for infringement of EU Regulation 785/2004 must be effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including the withdrawal of operating licenses and refusal of landing rights. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and Terrorism Risk Insurance Program provide federal insurance coverage for aviation and terrorism-related losses. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was initially authorized for three years but has been extended multiple times due to the insurance industry's reluctance to cover terrorism risk. The program provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering commercial property/casualty coverage, requiring them to offer terrorism coverage. The current version of the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program differs from TRIA in its coverage approach. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provides government reinsurance for private insurers covering losses due to terrorism. There are no upfront premiums, and any losses covered would be paid from the government's general fund. A post-event recoupment fee on commercial insurance policies is in place to recover costs. TRIA coverage is limited and operates through private insurers, with similar limits and deductibles as private insurance policies. A minimum of $100 million in insured losses is required before federal funds would flow under TRIA. Under TRIA, federal funds require a minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act. The coverage offered by private insurers must be the same as for other causes of loss, but separate premiums can be charged. State laws may limit terrorism premiums."
