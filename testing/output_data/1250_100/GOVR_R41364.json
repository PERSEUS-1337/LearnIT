    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire at the end of 2010. This would have increased capital gains tax rates to 20% and dividends taxed at ordinary rates. President Obama proposed retaining the 15% and 0% rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but taxing dividends and capital gains at 20% for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief Act of 2010. In 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act increased capital gains taxes for higher-income individuals. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is strongly affected by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue in FY2019, while the Congressional Budget Office projected a revenue difference of $40 billion due to the increase in effective capital gains tax rates. Assumptions about behavioral responses are the main reason for the reduction in projected revenues. Some supporters propose taxing capital gains as accrued to eliminate realization response for affected assets. Look-back treatment may apply to less easily valued assets, increasing taxes to achieve similar after-tax earnings. The analysis discusses how behavioral responses affect revenue projections and the implications for revenue effects. The analysis in this report suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT may likely understate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Taxpayers can choose to realize capital gains, affecting potential revenue. Realizations can be postponed to avoid taxes, leading to a decrease in revenue. Elasticities measure the response of realizations to changes in tax rates. The elasticity of capital gains tax rates determines the revenue gain or loss. A higher elasticity means a smaller revenue impact. If elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if greater than one, revenue is lost. The ratio of revenue gain projected to actual gain is one minus the elasticity. Three types of elasticities are relevant: permanent, short-run, and long-run. The short-term and transitory effects of tax rate changes are important to consider in addition to permanent elasticities. Short-term elasticity measures the immediate response to a permanent change, while transitory elasticity accounts for temporary fluctuations in income and tax rates. Taxpayers may adjust their behavior in anticipation of future tax changes, such as shifting realizations to take advantage of lower rates. These short-term and transitory effects pose challenges in estimation and impact shorter-term responses to tax changes. The short-term response to tax rate changes may be muted if there has been recent increases in realizations. Unannounced tax increases are unlikely to cause a contraction in realizations, as the stock of gains that have not been realized will simply remain unrealized. The transitory response, also known as short-term response, occurs due to temporary changes in tax rates. In 1986 and 2012, significant transitory responses were seen after tax rate changes. Even without changes in tax laws, individuals may still exhibit transitory responses due to fluctuations in income and taxes. Prior to 1987, when capital gains were subject to graduated rates, transitory responses were more pronounced. Elasticities of realizations responses are often based on the percentage change in gains divided by the percentage change in tax rates. The discussion in the 1990 debate focused on elasticities with reference to the assumed tax rate of 22%. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative, but in this report, they will be stated in absolute value. The revenue-maximizing tax rate is the rate at which the most capital gains tax revenue is realized. The 22% rate is considered appropriate for considering the effects of allowing tax increases. Additionally, there is a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office and Department of the Treasury estimate a 21.2% to 21.3% marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed increasing the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. Revenue-estimating agencies began investigating behavioral responses in capital gains realizations. The Administration chose an elasticity rate of 0.98, while the Joint Committee on Taxation used 0.76. Estimates of the realizations response varied dramatically, from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue gains or losses based on different elasticities. Aggregate time series estimates ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, indicating potential revenue gains of 10% to 70%. The range of estimated responses for realizations varied widely, from 0.55 to 3.8 based on individual taxpayer data. The Treasury's methodology for their estimate was not specified, but it was considered conservative compared to realizations estimates. Using individual data for estimation is preferred due to potential biases from aggregation and difficulty in controlling for changing factors over time. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is a challenge, especially for high-income individuals whose income and tax rates fluctuate. Individuals may need to time realizations to coincide with low tax rates and cash in assets during periods of low income. Panel data studies reported smaller but still significant elasticities, influencing the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity for revenue estimation. The last panel study also showed a large elasticity, suggesting that panel studies may not fully correct for transitory effects. Panel studies only covered a few years, so estimates could still reflect some transitory response elements. Ultimately, proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time. The range of realizations elasticities for revenue estimation purposes is broad, making it challenging to evaluate capital gains taxes accurately. Researchers focused on improving methods for estimating revenue and capital gains taxes after a significant increase in realizations in 1986. This spike, particularly in December, raised concerns about transitory responses affecting econometric studies. Multiple academic studies since 1990 have examined realizations responses, with estimates provided by CBO, JCT, and Treasury. CBO's caution that their estimates are not for revenue estimation purposes, but rather part of a broader statistical analysis. The studies focused on estimating revenue and capital gains taxes, with the tax rate being part of a statistical study to project realizations. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to realizations response, with a maximum elasticity of 0.5. This finding contradicted existing cross-section and panel studies estimating larger elasticities. The study in 1991 found an upper limit elasticity of 0.5 for asset sales, contradicting previous studies. It also estimated a 46% realizations to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 showed similar ratios and tax rates, supporting the initial findings. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study found an elasticity of 4.25, suggesting realizations could be 4.25 times their current value if all taxes were eliminated. The study also corrected the elasticity to 3.2 for the 1980s panel study, similar to cross-section results. Panel studies couldn't address transitory issues like cross-section studies. Burman and Randolph's study used state tax rates to estimate a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. Auerbach and Siegel replicated their findings. The Auerbach and Siegel study replicated their approach with different years, finding consistent results with Gravelle's estimate of limits. Subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, with the Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study showing the highest elasticities. These studies added state tax rates and had longer panels, reflecting timing responses rather than permanent responses. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study also provided sensitivity analysis, producing a wide range of estimates. The studies analyzed different time periods and variables, with elasticities ranging from 1.8 to 8.0. Time series studies added more years, leading to lower elasticities. Some studies used state data, showing higher elasticities. Australian data was also included in one study. The studies by Bogart and Gentry, as well as Bakija and Gentry, used aggregate data over time grouped by state and included time controls to identify a permanent response. Results were slightly above the Gravelle study's upper limit. Bakija and Gentry emphasized the importance of controlling for state fixed effects. The elasticities in Table 1 were lower than those in studies from the 1980s. Both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue to be gained from increasing the tax rate. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019. The estimates range from a reduction of 26% to 97% of the static gain, with a revenue gain ranging from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year. The results suggest interest in adopting measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method to eliminate the realizations response and increase capital gains. By raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points, revenue estimates vary significantly, with potential gains ranging from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year. Implementing an accrual-based taxation method with a look-back approach could eliminate the realizations response and boost capital gains revenues. The Auten and Joulfaian study suggests a substantial increase in revenue, while the Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study highlights varying estimates and fragility in the results. Time series analysis by Eichner and Sinai, along with CBO data, provide additional insights for consideration. The elasticity of revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates is likely below 0.5 based on various studies. Evidence suggests that revenue estimates may be understated, with potential gains three times higher than projected by the JCT. Implementing a look-back method for taxation could boost revenues significantly. The JCT's projections may underestimate revenue gains without accounting for realizations response. The method of calculating taxes under the look-back method involves estimating the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes using a semi-log function. The revenue equation is derived from gains and tax rate, showing that revenue is proportional to the tax rate. If the elasticity is 1, there is no revenue increase. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by the elasticity of bt, with a rate of 1/b. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. Calculations involve growth rate, holding period, sales price, basis, tax rate, and new basis. Econometric studies are included in the appendix. Econometric studies in the appendix analyze capital gains realizations and tax rates, facing challenges in data selection and methodology. Studies in the 1980s show elasticities at a 22% tax rate, with debates on using aggregate time series or individual taxpayer data. Aggregate time series results ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while estimates from individual data varied from 0.55 to almost 4. Using individual data is preferred due to loss of information with aggregate data. Changes in transactions costs and asset prices could overstate estimates. Researchers debated the reliability of aggregate time series results over individual data sets. The effective capital gains tax rate is a key issue in econometric analysis, as it is an endogenous variable influenced by realizations. Various techniques can be used to address this problem, such as using first dollar tax rates or instrumental variables methods. Endogeneity issues are more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. Another challenge with individual data is distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses due to fluctuating income and varying tax rates. The effective capital gains tax rate is influenced by realizations, which can fluctuate over time. Individuals may need to time realizations to coincide with low tax rates or cash in assets during periods of low income. Attempts to address this issue with panel studies have limitations. Studies since the 1980s have shown varying elasticities in response to tax rates. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in their six-year panel study. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in response to tax rates, similar to previous studies from the 1980s. Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a time series analysis from 1954-1985 to 1989, making changes in approach used by CBO. Their results were excluded from further analysis due to methodological concerns. The authors analyzed tax rates based on predicted gains using different techniques to increase the coefficient and elasticity. They considered using taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate as instruments, as well as differencing the data. Extending the time period through 1989 also affected the estimates. The study analyzed tax rates using predicted gains and the maximum tax rate as instruments, with elasticities ranging from 0.75 to 1.18. Using the maximum rate as an instrument posed challenges due to changes in the law over time. The authors concluded that micro-data approaches are superior. Burman and Randolph (1994) conducted an innovative study on permanent and transitory effects of tax rates using state tax rate variations. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, with a non-significant effect due to limited tax rate variation. They also estimated a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Several subsequent studies have used state tax rates in their analysis. The study by Bogart and Gentry (1995) used state-level gains from 1979 to 1990 to identify permanent responses to tax differentials. They found an elasticity of 0.65, reflecting a coefficient of 2.5 at the reported tax rate. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated these results using panel data from 1985 to 1994, reporting an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate. They also found a transitory elasticity of 4.9. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) report a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33, attributing it to the inclusion of the first dollar tax rate. They also find no response for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers. Eichner and Sinai (2000) exclude 1986 and report a coefficient of 2.28 for an elasticity. When excluding 1986 and possibly 1997, the coefficient in a semi-log specification is 2.18, indicating an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. Different specifications and methods were used, resulting in elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. The top marginal tax rate method yielded an estimate of 3.8, with an elasticity of 0.84, which increased to 5.13 and an elasticity of 1.13 when 1997 was also excluded. However, some tax rate coefficients were not statistically significant, suggesting more transitory elements in the results. The analysis in Table 1 shows a coefficient of 2.28, indicating a lower elasticity estimate compared to previous studies. The Evans study, using cross-section regression, found elasticities typically between 2 and 5. Some issues were noted with the public use file data. The study reflects the limitations of cross-section studies and the findings cannot be seen as permanent realizations elasticities. Bakija and Gentry (2014) use a 50-year panel of state data with state- and time-fixed effects. Dowd, McClelland and Muthitacharoen (2015) use a 10-year panel for their study. This study utilizes standard panel methods with a 10-year panel, year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects, and sensitivity analysis with different specifications. It is an aggregate time series study using Australian data from 1988 to 2015, including controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index. The study also includes citations to relevant studies from the 1980s on capital gains taxation and tax reform.
