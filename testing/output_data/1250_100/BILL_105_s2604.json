    "content": "SECTION 1. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS. Congress finds that the academic year in most U.S. schools is shorter than in other industrialized countries, leading to lower math scores for eighth-grade students compared to Japan, France, and Canada. Extending the academic year results in increased student learning time, even with additional teacher training and parent-teacher interaction. Students in the U.S. spend less time on core academic subjects in their final 4 years of schooling compared to other countries. American students spend fewer hours on core academic subjects compared to Germany, France, and Japan. Only 29 percent of American students spend at least 2 hours on homework per day, while half of European students do. Extending the academic year at schools can reduce the need for reviewing previous year's material. In 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning recommended keeping schools open longer to meet the needs of children and communities. Demonstration grants are authorized to extend the academic year for local educational agencies. The text discusses the need to extend the school year to 210 days, study effective methods for extending learning time, consult with community members, and implement strategies to maximize common core learning time. The term \"common core learning time\" refers to high-quality instruction in core academic subjects. To apply for a grant, a local education agency must submit an application describing activities, study projects, and strategies to enrich learning time for students. This may include block scheduling, team teaching, longer school days, and distance-learning technologies. The applicant must outline strategies to engage students, maximize learning time, and provide financial support for extended school days. They should also demonstrate the sustainability of a longer school year, involve teachers and school personnel in activities, and engage parents and stakeholders in the development and implementation process. The applicant must outline strategies for engaging students, maximizing learning time, and providing financial support for extended school days. They should also demonstrate the sustainability of a longer school year, involve teachers and school personnel in activities, engage parents and stakeholders, and collaborate with various community groups to extend learning time outside of the school day. Additionally, they must detail the training and professional development activities for teachers, set goals and objectives to help students reach State standards, outline methods for assessing progress, and explain how funds will be used in coordination with other Federal laws. A grant under this section will be awarded for a period of 3 years. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 authorized annually for 1999-2003 to extend school year to 210 days. At least 50% of funds must be used for grants."
