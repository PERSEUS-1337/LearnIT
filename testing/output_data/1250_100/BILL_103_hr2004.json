The United States textile machinery industry, consisting of approximately 500 small businesses, plays a vital role in textile production for various industries. The industry, mostly comprised of firms with 50 or fewer employees, is essential for defense needs. However, it has been weakened by imports and trade barriers, posing a threat to the textile and apparel complex. The United States textile machinery industry is facing challenges such as offshore competition, reduced shipments, and loss of tariff revenue. Despite being one of the largest employers in the country, the industry has seen a decline in employment over the years. The economic benefits of the industry include tariffs on imports, job preservation, industrial growth, and increased exports. Efforts to recapture the textile machinery market are crucial for sustaining the industry. Government studies recommend developing research and development programs to sustain and expand the textile machinery industry, with a focus on recapturing the market and providing direct access to capital for impacted businesses. The Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include a new section establishing the Textile Machinery Modernization Fund. The Textile Machinery Modernization Fund is defined in this section, along with terms like 'qualified organization' and 'qualified research project'. The Secretary of Commerce is referred to as the 'Secretary', and the definition of 'textile machinery and parts thereof' is provided. The Textile Machinery Modernization Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States for grants to qualified organizations for research projects and industry-wide research and promotion. The Fund consists of appropriated amounts and is administered by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary may make grants to qualified organizations for research projects in consultation with industry representatives and the public. Grants must be awarded within 12 months of application. The Secretary may make grants to qualified organizations for research projects in consultation with industry representatives and the public. Grants awarded under this section are subject to limitations, including not exceeding 60 percent of the project cost and being limited to expenditures above the organization's baseline average for textile machinery research. If funds are insufficient, grants will be prorated. Appropriations are made to the Fund for this purpose. Appropriations are made to the Fund for each fiscal year from revenues of customs duties on textile machinery imported into the US, with a minimum of 10% of revenues or $10,000,000 allocated. The total amount in the Fund cannot exceed $10,000,000 per fiscal year."
