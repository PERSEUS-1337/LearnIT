    "content": "The Act titled \"Stopping Illegal Obamacare Subsidies Act\" limits auto-enrollment in health plans under American Health Benefit Exchanges until inconsistencies are resolved as per the Inspector General's June 2014 report. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must make public the steps to resolve inconsistencies in eligibility for healthcare programs within 30 days of the Act's enactment. They must also disclose the methods used to monitor progress in resolving these inconsistencies. Premium assistance tax credits and reduced cost-sharing programs may be suspended until these issues are resolved. The premium tax credit and cost-sharing programs will not be available for plan year 2015 until all inconsistencies related to invalid social security numbers are resolved by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. If applicant information contains inconsistencies, the Secretary will request additional information within 90 days for enrollment in a qualified health plan. During an inconsistency period, an individual enrolled in a qualified health plan may not participate in the premium assistance credit program or reduced cost-sharing program. If the individual cooperates with a request for additional information and is later determined eligible, they will retroactively receive benefits for the inconsistency period. Failure to submit additional information will result in withdrawal from the premium assistance credit and reduced cost-sharing programs. During an inconsistency period, if an individual enrolled in a qualified health plan fails to provide additional information, they will be disenrolled from premium assistance and cost-sharing programs. The Secretary will notify the health insurance issuer, and the applicant must re-enroll with accurate information during the next open enrollment period. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"inconsistencies\" refer to differences in self-attested information provided by an applicant for health plan enrollment and eligibility determination for financial assistance programs. This includes discrepancies in citizenship, income, employer-sponsored coverage, incarceration status, or other factors affecting eligibility. The \"inconsistency period\" is defined as 90 days. The term \"inconsistency period\" refers to the 90-day period starting from the date the notice of an inconsistency is sent to the applicant."
