    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products may be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles. A balanced portfolio of renewable energy resources will be procured to achieve the goals of cost-effectiveness and suitability. The amended Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code allows for various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products must meet project viability principles and may be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts. Eligible renewable energy resources must have a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority, an agreement to dynamically transfer electricity to a California balancing authority, or earn unbundled renewable energy credits from electricity generated by an entity excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation. The amended Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code allows for electricity generated at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity and put into service after January 1, 2016, to earn renewable energy credits. The facility must meet specific criteria and not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. Retail sellers must procure a certain percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products for each compliance period, with specific product content requirements. Retail sellers must procure a percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products for each compliance period, with specific product content requirements. Contracts executed after June 1, 2010, have limitations on the percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products that can meet product content requirements. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if the renewable energy resource was eligible at the time of contract execution. Retail sellers can apply for a reduction in procurement content requirements if they cannot comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission may reduce the requirement, but it cannot go below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. The renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser. The electricity generated and sold by the public entity must be added to the total retail sales for calculating renewables portfolio standard procurement obligations."
