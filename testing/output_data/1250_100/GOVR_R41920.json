    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating provisions from S. 1253. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be resolved in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authority. The White House has criticized aspects of both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 and has threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authority on intelligence collection, terrorist incapacitation, and national protection. The bills aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11 attacks through the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) grants the President authority to use force against nations, organizations, or persons involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks or harboring such individuals to prevent future acts of terrorism. Many captured individuals have been placed in preventive detention to prevent them from engaging in terrorist activities. Some have been tried in military commissions or civilian courts for terrorism-related crimes. The 2004 Hamdi v. Rumsfeld case affirmed the President's ability to detain enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The AUMF grants the President authority to detain members or supporters of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or other groups apprehended away from the Afghan combat zone. The D.C. Circuit has generally supported the government's detention authority under the AUMF. Congress has not passed any legislation to clarify the scope of detention authority. The circuit court has looked to post-AUMF legislation for guidance on military detention categories. The AUMF grants the government authority to detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including those who support these forces. Most detainees are captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or other locations for interrogation. Detainees in Parwan, Afghanistan, are also held. These facilities may not be viable for future captures outside of Afghanistan. The current practice for future captures outside of Afghanistan is ad hoc. Persons suspected of terrorist activity on behalf of Al Qaeda are usually prosecuted in federal court instead of being placed in military detention. There have been instances where individuals arrested in the US were designated as \"enemy combatants\" but were ultimately transferred back to civil authorities for trial in federal court. The Supreme Court will hear habeas petitions, raising uncertainty about prior military detention. Controversy surrounds how suspected terrorists should be handled, with debates between military custody, civilian law enforcement, or executive discretion. Disagreements over the appropriate model have arisen in high-profile cases involving suspected terrorists. Congress passed funding restrictions in response to the Obama Administration's plans to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the US for trial, effectively barring transfers for the 2011 fiscal year. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 extended this prohibition through FY2012. This restriction makes trial by military commission the only option for prosecuting Guantanamo detainees, as no civilian court operates there. On July 5, 2011, Somali national Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame was brought to the United States to face terrorism-related charges in a civilian court after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for interrogation. Controversy arose over the handling of suspects like Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, with debates on whether they should be detained and interrogated by military authorities. The Administration faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities in Iraq. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address these issues. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended by U.S. authorities in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 passed by the House contains provisions reaffirming the conflict, imposing restrictions on detainee transfers, and requiring foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses to be tried by military commission. The White House criticized the detainee provisions and threatened to veto any bill challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 authorized the detention of certain categories of persons. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with revised detainee provisions despite objections from the White House and the Department of Defense. The bill addressed the detention of certain categories of persons and Guantanamo detainee transfers. The Senate passed S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions, clarifying that the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda did not modify existing authorities relating to U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. Differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill will be considered in conference. The sections address U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters, including detention authority under the AUMF, status determinations, periodic reviews, and concerns about recidivism in transferring detainees from Guantanamo. The legal basis for detaining individuals captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated entities is not clearly defined by the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Obama Administration interpreted the AUMF to allow for the detention of those involved in the 9/11 attacks, as well as individuals supporting Taliban or Al Qaeda forces. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" in the AUMF raises questions about the extent of the detention authority claimed by the executive branch. The Obama Administration's interpretation of the AUMF allows for the detention of individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, supporting Taliban or Al Qaeda forces, and \"associated forces.\" There is uncertainty surrounding the extent of the executive's detention authority, particularly regarding the definition of \"substantial support\" and \"associated forces.\" The government has not provided clarity on these aspects, leading to ongoing legal disputes. Recent court decisions have not clarified the \"substantial support\" requirement for determining detention eligibility under the AUMF. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, allowing for the detention of individuals connected to Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or similar groups. The AUMF does not limit covered organizations to just Al Qaeda or the Taliban, giving the United States the authority to detain individuals to prevent future acts of terrorism. The AUMF grants the United States authority to detain individuals connected to Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Recent court decisions have not clarified the criteria for determining detention eligibility under the AUMF. The government's test for membership in an \"associated force\" includes affiliation with forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. In Parhat v. Gates, the court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement made one an \"enemy combatant.\" The court in Parhat v. Gates rejected the government's argument that affiliation with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement made one an \"enemy combatant.\" The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely linked to Al Qaeda or the Taliban, but the court found insufficient evidence to establish this connection. The court's decision might have been different if a plain-language interpretation of \"associated force\" was adopted. The government's definition of \"associated force\" in habeas cases has been limited to armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") have been considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit also upheld the detention of individuals associated with the 55th Arab Military Brigade. The Administration has suggested that groups outside of Afghanistan may also be considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The AUMF authorizes the use of force against \"associated forces\" outside of Afghanistan. There is uncertainty about the detention authority of persons captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens. The U.S. Court of Appeals has allowed detention of individuals functionally part of Al Qaeda, including U.S. citizens captured outside the U.S. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and resident alien captured in the U.S. designated as enemy combatants. The AUMF allows for the use of force against \"associated forces\" outside of Afghanistan, raising questions about the detention authority of individuals captured outside the U.S., including U.S. citizens. The Pentagon established CSRTs to determine enemy combatant status of Guantanamo detainees, with 539 confirmed cases between 2004 and 2009. The process allowed for transfer of detainees not deemed enemy combatants. The CSRT process, used for Guantanamo detainees, has been largely defunct since 2007. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have fewer procedural rights. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. The Obama Administration implemented a new review system for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011, establishing a Periodic Review Board for Guantanamo detainees to assess the need for continued detention. The Obama Administration established a Periodic Review Board for Guantanamo detainees to assess the need for continued detention. The Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for finding suitable transfer locations for detainees not deemed to warrant continued detention. Detainees have the right to challenge their detention and present evidence in a hearing before the PRB. The process is discretionary and does not create new detention authority. Concerns about detainees released from Guantanamo engaging in terrorist activities have led Congress to limit transfers, requiring certification of measures in the destination country. Post-release activities of detainees remain classified, with debates on the significance of their involvement in terrorism. Policy implications vary, with some advocating against transfers and others questioning long-term detention without trial. In 2007, the Pentagon estimated that 30 former detainees engaged in terrorist activities. In 2007, the Pentagon estimated that 30 former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities or \"anti-U.S. propaganda.\" Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged these numbers, citing discrepancies in data and lack of verification. They argued that post-release terrorist conduct could be due to radicalization during internment, not necessarily recidivism. In 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners were believed to have engaged in terrorism. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. The report in 2010 stated that 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% were suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer. The report stated that out of 150 confirmed or suspected recidivist detainees, 13 are dead, 54 are in custody, and 83 remain at large. 66 detainees transferred from Guantanamo since Executive Order 13492, 2 are confirmed and 3 are suspected of terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been challenged, with estimates suggesting a 6% threat rate. The discrepancy between the report's numbers and publicly available sources remains unexplained, but there is agreement that detainee recidivism related to terrorism has increased. The House of Representatives passed subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540 on May 26, 2011, which defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011, under the Department of Defense's control. The term does not specifically apply to detainees under the AUMF, potentially including those not considered enemy belligerents. The provision raises questions about individuals under DOD's \"effective control\" but not in custody. The House of Representatives passed a provision in H.R. 1540 defining \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo under DOD supervision. The provision raises questions about detainees under DOD's \"effective control\" but not in custody. Additionally, Section 1033 of the bill allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, addressing concerns about the death penalty only being permitted with a unanimous vote by commission members. Section 1033 of the bill allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty with a unanimous vote by commission members. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and grants the President authority to detain captured belligerents. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, granting the President authority to detain belligerents, including those associated with Al Qaeda, Taliban, or supporting forces, until hostilities end. This provision has sparked controversy among supporters and opponents regarding its interpretation and implications. Opponents and proponents debate the inclusion of \"associated forces\" in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540, with concerns about expanding the armed conflict beyond the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The provision grants the President broad discretion in determining parties to use force against, potentially going beyond the executive branch's characterization of the conflict. The provision in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 grants the President discretion to target entities that have engaged in or supported hostilities with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces, potentially expanding the scope of the armed conflict. The legislative history suggests that this provision is not meant to significantly broaden ongoing operations. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 grants the President discretion to target entities involved in hostilities with Al Qaeda, Taliban, or associated forces, without significantly expanding ongoing operations. The House Armed Services Committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force to address the evolving threat posed by these groups. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force remains consistent with Congress's authority. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 does not appear to expand the use of force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. The term \"associated forces\" may have a broader interpretation, potentially superseding the AUMF. The language in paragraph (3) mirrors that used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo. The White House strongly objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, arguing that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine the necessity of continued military detention for national security. The White House objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, stating it could create confusion. Section 1036 mandates the Secretary of Defense to set up a review process for Guantanamo detainees to assess the need for continued military detention for national security. This process involves periodic reviews by military officers, stringent criteria for detainee assessment, and limitations on private counsel assistance. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on the establishment of this review process. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting a full review no sooner than 21 days after arrival. The detainee is entitled to assistance from a military representative and can present statements, evidence, and witnesses. The detainee receives an unclassified summary of information considered by the panel before the hearing. The military panel conducts annual file reviews for Guantanamo detainees to assess new information on the threat posed by the individual. Submitting officials must provide relevant information from discovery in any military commission case. The panel considers factors like the likelihood of the individual resuming terrorist activity if released and reestablishing ties with hostile organizations. The military panel conducts annual file reviews for Guantanamo detainees to assess the threat posed by the individual, considering factors like the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity and reestablishing ties with hostile organizations. Section 1036 requires an interagency review board to review the panel's recommendations for clear error and identify a suitable country for transfer if a detainee is recommended for release. The interagency review board evaluates recommendations for transferring Guantanamo detainees to a country that can safely house them and prevent terrorist activities. The detainee has no right to challenge the decision in U.S. courts, and the White House has raised concerns about potential veto due to Section 1036 of the bill. The bill undermines the President's periodic review process and limits the transfer of non-citizen detainees held abroad into the United States, hindering national security interests and DOD's detention operations. Congress enacted funding measures to restrict closing the Guantanamo detention facility. The Guantanamo detention facility funding restrictions, including those in the 2012 Minibus, prohibit transferring detainees to the US for any purpose, leading to military commissions as the primary forum for prosecution until the end of FY2012. The restrictions were partly motivated by plans to transfer detainees for trial in civilian courts, which are not available at Guantanamo. The funding limitations cover a broader category of detainees for the duration of FY2012. H.R. 1540, applicable for FY2012, broadens detainee restrictions compared to the 2012 Minibus. Section 1039 limits transfer/release of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities outside Guantanamo. The restrictions prevent DOD from transferring wartime detainees to the US, but not other agencies. These restrictions expire at the end of FY2012, while other provisions of H.R. 1540 extend beyond FY2012. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which limits the transfer of detainees into the United States and interferes with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in Article III courts. The Obama Administration argues that this measure undermines national security efforts and restricts the ability to prosecute dangerous terrorists in federal courts. The 2012 Minibus restricts the use of funds by the Department of Defense to construct or modify facilities in the US or its territories for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring or releasing detainees to foreign countries, except under certain criteria or court orders. These restrictions mirror those in previous defense authorization acts and appropriations acts. The 2012 Minibus imposes funding restrictions on the Department of Defense for Guantanamo detainee transfers or releases to foreign countries. These restrictions aim to prevent detainee recidivism and require certification from the Secretary of Defense before any transfer can occur. No detainee has been transferred since these restrictions went into effect. The 2012 Minibus imposes funding restrictions on the Department of Defense for Guantanamo detainee transfers to foreign countries. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the receiving country will control the detainee, prevent future threats, share information, and allow access to US agencies. These requirements are similar to those for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. Additionally, the receiving country must agree to permit US authorities access to the transferred individual. Section 1040 of the 2012 Minibus prohibits funds from being used to transfer Guantanamo detainees to foreign governments if there is a confirmed case of terrorist activity post-transfer. The White House opposes these restrictions, stating they interfere with the executive's ability to make foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days. The 2012 Minibus bill includes provisions on Guantanamo detainees, such as restrictions on family visits and rights for detainees repatriated to certain countries. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country. Section 1043 of the 2012 Minibus bill applies to citizens of Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands who were detained at Guantanamo and returned to their home country. Section 1042 requires consultation before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. Section 1042 of the defense authorization bill requires consultation before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. The White House opposes this provision, arguing that it could disrupt existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission. The provision in the defense authorization bill raises questions about its application to terrorist attacks, particularly regarding failed attacks and the definition of a \"terrorist attack.\" The criteria for applying the provision to cases like that of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab are unclear, especially in cases where attacks take place outside the United States. It would need to be established that the offense related to the attack can be tried by a military commission and that the accused is subject to its jurisdiction. The accused must be subject to the jurisdiction of a military commission for prosecution. The offense must be committed in the context of hostilities, defined as any conflict subject to the laws of war. The accused must not be a US citizen and must be an unprivileged enemy belligerent to be tried by a military commission. The bill outlines criteria for determining if a foreign national qualifies as an unprivileged enemy belligerent, without specifying how these criteria are to be determined. Military commissions and Article III courts could make jurisdictional determinations. The provision may complicate extradition and trial of terrorism suspects. The provision in the bill may only apply to actual qualifying terrorist attacks, potentially excluding foreign nationals arrested in sting operations. It does not mandate government action to determine if foreign nationals are subject to the provision, but this determination could be challenged through habeas corpus. The bill does not prohibit trials in Article III courts for the individuals it describes, but states they can only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. This could potentially be avoided by framing the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. Section 1042 allows broader discretion for executive branch officials in prosecutorial decisions compared to Section 1046. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the jurisdiction of an Article III court. Executive branch officials criticize this provision for limiting their discretion in choosing the prosecution forum. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information related to military operations against terrorism. Section 1041 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to Congress on global counterterrorism operations, including authorities and legal issues. Section 1044 expresses Congress's support for DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to terrorist groups. The President is required to issue planning guidance and submit copies to Congress within 15 days. The President must submit guidance documents to Congress within 15 days of completion. Agencies must enter into a memorandum of understanding for guidance implementation. Senate bill S. 1867 on \"Detainee Matters\" was passed with revisions addressing Administration concerns. A single amendment clarified legal authority to detain persons captured in conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 was passed with provisions from S. 1867. Section 1031 affirms AUMF authority for U.S. Armed Forces to detain. Section 1031 of bill S. 1867 affirms the AUMF authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as unprivileged enemy belligerents. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the U.S. The earlier version of Section 1031 directly authorized the Armed Forces to detain these individuals. The AUMF authorized the Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as unprivileged enemy belligerents until the end of hostilities. The White House objected to limiting detentions to those captured during military operations. Section 1031 of Senate-passed S. 1867 allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to a foreign country. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" The revised provision of S. 1867 seemed to leave the application of the AUMF to U.S. persons in an unsettled position, reinforcing the executive branch's view of detention authority. The debate over the application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and residents led to the adoption of an amendment clarifying that existing laws regarding detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens remain unchanged. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi allowed for the military detention of individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, regardless of their citizenship. The circumstances of preventive military detention for persons captured in other locations, regardless of citizenship, have not been definitively adjudicated. Section 1031 does not clarify the detention of U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or persons captured within the U.S. under the AUMF. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on its application. The revised Section 1031 requires ongoing accounting of \"associated forces\" and \"substantial support.\" The Administration has concerns about codifying existing authorities, warning of potential legal questions. Section 1032 mandates temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and \"associated forces.\" The revised Section 1031 mandates the detention of captured individuals meeting specific criteria during hostilities authorized by the AUMF. It excludes U.S. citizens but includes U.S. resident aliens, with detention subject to constitutional limits. Covered persons must be members of al-Qaeda or associated forces involved in attacking the U.S. or its allies, to be held by military authorities until lawful resolution. The revised Section 1031 mandates the detention of captured individuals meeting specific criteria during hostilities authorized by the AUMF. It excludes U.S. citizens but includes U.S. resident aliens, with detention subject to constitutional limits. Covered persons must be members of al-Qaeda or associated forces involved in attacking the U.S. or its allies, to be held by military authorities until lawful resolution. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" acting in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda, with no explicit mention of the Taliban unless their actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. The revised Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" coordinating with or directed by Al Qaeda, raising questions on mandatory detention for those involved in coordinated activities. The determination may depend on the specific attack the individual is linked to. The section does not apply to \"lone wolf\" terrorists without ties to Al Qaeda or associated forces. The definition of an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" remains unclear. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 is ambiguous regarding the scope of attacks it covers, with potential interpretations ranging from military operations to terrorist acts against civilians. The reference to lawful resident aliens being detained based on conduct in the US supports a broader reading of the term \"attack.\" The mandatory detention requirement is related to hostilities authorized by the AUMF, potentially excluding insurgents in Iraq but applying to individuals believed to be associated with Al Qaeda. S. 1867 includes a provision for the President to report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision regarding individuals believed to be associated with Al Qaeda. Procedures include designating authorized personnel, preventing surveillance interruptions, and waiving authority for transferring individuals from third countries if necessary. The bill includes provisions for the President to report to Congress on procedures for implementing the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with other requirements for status determinations and detainment under the AUMF. The bill does not specify whether multiple processes can be used to determine detainability or if a single procedure can be used for both determinations. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, as it could complicate trials of covered persons and limit counterterrorism tools. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta also doubts its advantages for national security and criticizes its lack of clarity on limiting scope to persons captured abroad. The Obama Administration strongly opposes Section 1032 of the bill, calling it unnecessary and controversial, as it restricts the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. The White House views the extension of transfer certification requirements to those covered by Section 1032 as inappropriate and complicating. The Administration doubts that revisions to the provision will address the fundamental problems it perceives. The President opposes Section 1032 of the bill, deeming it unnecessary and controversial. It restricts the President's authority in defending the nation from terrorist threats. Section 1033 extends restrictions on using military funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees unless specific criteria are met. This could lead to confusion in counterterrorism operations. The Senate bill requires certification from the Secretary of State and Director of National Intelligence that the destination country is not a sponsor of terrorism, can maintain control over the detainee, and has taken measures to prevent any threat to the US. The bill also mandates sharing information with the US and preventing the individual from engaging in terrorism. These requirements are similar to previous legislation but do not include the need for access to detainees by US authorities. The certification requirement for transferring detainees includes permitting US authorities access and prohibiting transfers to countries with previous detainee recidivism. Waivers can be granted by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence if alternative actions address the purpose of the measures. The Secretary may issue a waiver for transferring detainees if alternative actions will mitigate risks, with a determination of national security interests required 30 days prior to the transfer. The transfer restrictions apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. The Section 1033 of the 2012 NDAA may cover foreign refugees brought to the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of certain provisions in the bill. Section 1034 prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees. The 2012 NDAA includes restrictions on detention in the custody of the Department of Defense without Congressional authorization. The Senate bill allows for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to civilian law enforcement for prosecution and does not prohibit their release into the United States if cleared of enemy belligerency status. The Senate bill in the 2012 NDAA addresses detainee transfers to the United States from Guantanamo for continued military detention. It clarifies aspects of the periodic review process established by Executive Order 13567, emphasizing that the purpose is to determine if a detainee poses a threat to U.S. security. The Secretary of Defense has the final decision on detainee release or transfer, not bound by panel recommendations. The Senate bill in the 2012 NDAA addresses detainee transfers to the United States from Guantanamo for continued military detention. The Secretary of Defense has the final decision on detainee release or transfer, not bound by panel recommendations. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report explaining the procedures for determining the status of persons detained under the AUMF. The Administration objects to this provision as it shifts responsibility from a collaborative, interagency review process to the Defense Department. The 2012 NDAA addresses detainee transfers from Guantanamo for continued military detention. Section 1036 outlines procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents, providing certain elements for their hearings. This provision may grant detainees in Afghanistan more privileges during status determination than those at Guantanamo. The 2012 NDAA addresses detainee transfers from Guantanamo for continued military detention. Section 1036 outlines procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents, potentially affecting habeas challenges by Guantanamo detainees. The implications of Section 1036 on persons held at Guantanamo may depend on its interpretation regarding long-term detention under the AUMF. The 2012 NDAA addresses detainee transfers from Guantanamo for continued military detention. Section 1036 outlines procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents, affecting habeas challenges by Guantanamo detainees. The reading of war principles allows for enemy belligerents to be held to prevent their return to combat, with implications for long-term detention under the AUMF. Section 1036 of the 2012 NDAA outlines procedures for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents, affecting habeas challenges by Guantanamo detainees. The White House disapproves of this provision, claiming it conflicts with established military review processes. Section 1037 permits plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540."
