The proposed algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised manner. It utilizes an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives, with customizable temporal similarity metrics. A visualization method is used to analyze learned features, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods across various timeseries data applications. Deep learning is widely used for supervised learning, but unsupervised learning techniques are needed for data without reliable labels. Clustering methods organize similar objects into clusters, but applying them to time series data is a challenge. Unsupervised time series clustering is crucial for various fields like finance and medicine. Unsupervised time series clustering is challenging due to variations in properties and features. To address this, a novel algorithm called deep temporal clustering (DTC) transforms time series data into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network. The DTC algorithm aims to uncover latent dimensions in the data for effective clustering. In a three-level approach, DTC uses CNN and BI-LSTM to reduce data dimensionality and uncover spatio-temporal dimensions for clustering unlabeled time series data effectively. The method achieves high performance without parameter adjustment and includes a unique visualization feature for event localization. The study introduces an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on effective latent representation and similarity metrics. The algorithm outperforms existing methods on real-world time series datasets. The core issues in temporal clustering are effective dimensionality reduction and choosing an appropriate similarity metric. One class of solutions focuses on application-dependent dimensionality reduction to filter out noise, while another class works on creating suitable similarity measures between time series. The choice of similarity measure significantly impacts the clustering results. Recent research has highlighted the importance of selecting the right similarity measure for clustering time series data. While a good similarity measure is crucial, it may not be enough without proper dimensionality reduction. Transforming time series data into a low-dimensional latent space has been effective for temporal clustering, but there is a lack of a standardized method for choosing the optimal latent space. To achieve meaningful clustering results, it is essential to ensure that the similarity metric aligns with the temporal feature space. Existing clustering methods for static data have shown success by combining a stacked autoencoder for dimensionality reduction with a k-means objective for clustering, but these approaches are not suitable for time series data. The goal in unsupervised clustering of temporal sequences is to group them into clusters based on their similarities. The goal is to perform unsupervised clustering of unlabeled sequences into clusters based on latent high-level features. A temporal autoencoder (TAE) is used to encode the input signal into a latent space, followed by a BI-LSTM for clustering. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for extracting short-term features and a max pooling layer for dimensionality reduction. Effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering. The text discusses the use of a BI-LSTM for clustering unlabeled sequences based on high-level features. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for feature extraction and a clustering layer for assigning sequences to clusters. The model minimizes two cost functions: mean square error for sequence reconstruction and a clustering metric for separating sequences based on high-level features. The clustering metric optimization in the network modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to separate sequences into distinct clusters based on spatio-temporal behavior. The end-to-end optimization efficiently extracts features that disentangle the high-dimensional manifolds of input dynamics, unlike traditional approaches that only optimize for reconstruction or separation. This results in marked improvement in unsupervised categorization. The approach shows significant improvement in unsupervised categorization by utilizing end-to-end optimization for dimensionality reduction and clustering of spatio-temporal data. By leveraging temporal continuity, informative features are extracted and encoded in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer consists of centroids initialized through hierarchical clustering in the feature space Z. The temporal clustering layer utilizes centroids estimates for clustering spatio-temporal data. It alternates between computing assignment probabilities and updating centroids based on a loss function. The distances from centroids are normalized into probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. The probability assignment of a latent signal belonging to a cluster is determined by the signal in the latent space obtained from a temporal autoencoder. The parameter \u03b1 represents the degrees of freedom in the Students t distribution. The temporal similarity metric siml() calculates distances between the encoded signal z i and centroid w j. A 2 cluster example is illustrated in FIG0, showing distances d 1 and d 2 from centroids w 1 and w 2 using a similarity metric. Various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2, which computes similarity based on the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation. The core idea of CID is that as complexity differences between series increase, the distance also increases. The complexity of input sequences determines the distance calculation method. Correlation based Similarity (COR) uses Pearson's correlation, while Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) uses autocorrelation coefficients. Training the temporal clustering layer involves minimizing KL divergence loss between q and a target distribution to maintain accurate latent representations. The optimization problem involves joint clustering and autoencoder optimization by minimizing KL divergence and mean squared error loss. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is crucial, achieved through pretraining the autoencoder and initializing centroids using hierarchical clustering. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are updated using backpropagation mini-batch SGD, with the target distribution updated during each iteration. The text discusses the use of backpropagation mini-batch SGD to update target distribution during SGD updates. This approach helps prevent problematic solutions and ensures convergence of the latent representation to minimize clustering and MSE loss. A heatmap-generating network is created to localize main data features, using cluster labels from a DTC network to train a hierarchical convolutional network. Heatmaps are generated to show relevant parts of inputs. The networks were implemented and tested using Python and TensorFlow. The networks were implemented and tested using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras on Nvidia GTX 1080Ti graphics processor. Heatmaps correctly mark the time location of events, with higher values indicating higher likelihood. The DTC algorithm's performance was evaluated on various real-world datasets, including UCR Time Series Classification Archive datasets and spacecraft magnetometer data from the NASA MMS Mission. The plasma environment shows transient structures and waves, focusing on detecting spacecraft crossings of flux transfer events (FTEs) characterized by a bipolar signature in the magnetic field. A DTC algorithm is compared against hierarchical clustering and k-Shape, a state-of-the-art temporal clustering algorithm. Four similarity metrics are used in experiments, with expert labels for datasets used only to measure model performance. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve are utilized for evaluation. The study evaluates a DTC algorithm for detecting spacecraft crossings of flux transfer events in the plasma environment. Evaluation metrics include ROC and AUC, with bootstrap sampling and parameter optimization. The deep architecture includes convolution and deconvolution layers, Bi-LSTM filters, and autoencoder pre-training. Temporal clustering centroids are initialized using hierarchical clustering, and the model is jointly trained for clustering and autoencoder loss. The DTC algorithm uses a criterion of 0.1% change in cluster assignment, with a mini-batch size of 64 and a starting learning rate of 0.1. Results from the MMS dataset show activation maps correlating well with event locations. Joint training of reconstruction and clustering loss leads to superior performance compared to disjointed training. The DTC algorithm shows improved performance with joint end-to-end training compared to disjoint training on the MMS dataset, with an average AUC of 0.93 vs. 0.88. Results from DTC outperform baseline clustering techniques across various datasets and metrics. ROC comparisons demonstrate DTC's robustness and superior performance. In this work, the focus is on unsupervised learning of patterns in temporal sequences, event detection, and clustering. The results show high agreement between unsupervised clustering and human-labeled categories, indicating effective dimensionality reduction. The approach is promising for real-world applications, with potential for generalization to multichannel spatio-temporal input."
