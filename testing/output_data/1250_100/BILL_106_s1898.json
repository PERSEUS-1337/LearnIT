Concerns about escapes and the need for oversight by the Attorney General are emphasized. While government entities may prefer using law enforcement officers for transporting violent prisoners, logistical or fiscal reasons may lead to the use of private companies. The use of private prisoner transport companies for moving violent prisoners should be regulated to enhance public safety. The Act defines key terms such as \"crime of violence,\" \"private prisoner transport company,\" and \"violent prisoner.\" It also discusses the need for federal regulation of prisoner transport companies. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines. These regulations will cover background checks, drug testing, and training requirements for employees involved in prisoner transport. The regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines include training on restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving. There are restrictions on employee duty hours, minimum standards for supervising violent prisoners, requirements for employee uniforms and identification, and standards for prisoner restraints. The regulations for transporting violent prisoners include minimum requirements for restraints, advance notification to local law enforcement, immediate reporting of escapes, and safety standards in accordance with Federal and State law. The regulations do not impose stricter standards on private prisoner transport companies than those applicable to the United States Marshals. The regulations for transporting violent prisoners include minimum requirements for restraints, advance notification to local law enforcement, immediate reporting of escapes, and safety standards in accordance with Federal and State law.

SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Any person violating the regulations may face a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, restitution to entities for costs incurred due to escapes, and prosecution expenses."
