    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996\" establishes regulations for dredged material disposal facilities. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 amends Section 101 to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities associated with Federal navigation projects. This includes upland, aquatic, and confined aquatic disposal facilities for harbors and inland harbors. The Act also limits the Federal share of costs for constructing these facilities. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 amends Section 101 to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects. The Act limits the Federal share of costs for construction to $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Eligible operation and maintenance costs are covered by the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 amends Section 101 to include provisions for Federal navigation projects' dredged material disposal facilities. This includes the Federal share of costs for constructing, operating, and maintaining these facilities, as well as environmental dredging and disposal facilities for contaminated sediments in Federal navigation channels. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 includes provisions for Federal navigation projects' dredged material disposal facilities in critical port and harbor areas to facilitate maritime commerce and navigation. Preference is given to port areas where annual harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures. This subsection applies to dredged material disposal facilities and associated navigation projects where construction contracts have not been awarded before the enactment of this subsection. The subsection requires cooperative agreements between the Secretary and non-Federal interests to be amended to conform to new provisions, including Federal share of project costs for dredged material disposal facilities. The amendment applies prospectively and does not increase non-Federal costs for dredged material disposal facilities."
