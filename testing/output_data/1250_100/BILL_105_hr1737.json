The Act titled \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" emphasizes the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive health care for women throughout their lifetime. This includes managing overall health beyond reproductive care, reducing the need for referrals to other physicians, and offering basic health services uniquely tailored to women. The \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" highlights the significance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing comprehensive health services to women. Over 20 States have taken steps to improve residents' access to these specialists, but patients in other States or Federally-governed health plans may face restrictions or limitations. SEC. 2. ASSURING ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. This section introduces standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services in group health plans. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. The group health plan must allow women to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for gynecologic care without prior authorization. The plan cannot deny or penalize women for enrolling or receiving necessary gynecologic care. The group health plan must comply with notice requirements and allow negotiation of reimbursements with providers for care provided. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees in connection with group health insurance coverage are not superseded by this section. The text discusses amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide greater protections to enrollees in group health insurance coverage. SEC. 713. STANDARDS RELATING TO ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES. In connection with group health plans, female enrollees can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization requirements. The section outlines that a participating physician ordering gynecologic care is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. It clarifies that this does not waive coverage requirements for medical necessity. Additionally, it prohibits denying women coverage to avoid these rules, offering incentives to accept less protection, or penalizing providers for offering care. The section specifies reimbursement for providers who offer care to participants, treats the requirements as a plan modification, allows negotiation of reimbursement levels, and does not preempt more protective state laws for health insurance issuers. The section does not supersede state laws that provide greater protections for enrollees in group health insurance coverage. Amendments are made to various sections of the Act to include references to section 713. Standards relating to access to obstetrical and gynecological services are addressed in section 2752 of the Public Health Service Act. This section applies to individual health insurance and does not override state laws that offer more extensive protections for enrollees in group health insurance coverage. Amendments have been made to other sections of the Act to reference section 713. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market, with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees in group health insurance coverage are not overridden by this section. Section 2762 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-62) is amended to include references to other sections. The effective dates for these amendments vary depending on the type of health plan or insurance coverage. Amendments apply to group health plans starting in 1998 and individual market coverage after a specific date. There are exceptions for plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the Act's enactment. The last collective bargaining agreements related to the plan must terminate by January 1, 1998, or the date of enactment of the Act. Plan amendments made to conform to new requirements do not count as termination of the collective bargaining agreement."
