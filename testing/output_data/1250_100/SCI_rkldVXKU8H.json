    "content": "Foveation is compared to non-foveating deep networks using different variable-resolution downsampling methods in ImageNet recognition with a Densenet-121 network. The best variable-resolution method slightly outperforms uniform downsampling, suggesting foveation does not significantly impact object recognition in deep networks. Different foveated downsampling approaches perform similarly to each other, with the best method slightly outperforming uniform downsampling. This indicates that foveation may not be crucial for object recognition but also does not hinder it. The study compared foveation to non-foveating deep networks in ImageNet recognition using a DenseNet-121 network. Different downsampling methods were used, with the best variable-resolution method slightly outperforming uniform downsampling. The training procedure included random flips and batch size adjustments, with networks trained for 90 epochs using SGD. Extrapolation was done for image boundaries, and multiple points were sometimes chosen in a single image.

Multiple saliency points were selected in images, with modifications made to avoid selecting similar points."
