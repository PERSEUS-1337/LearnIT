The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to include income and gains derived from minerals, natural resources, renewable energy, and electric power generation projects. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act expands the types of facilities eligible for tax benefits, including electricity storage devices, combined heat and power, and renewable thermal energy generation. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act expands tax benefits to include waste heat to power, renewable fuel infrastructure, and renewable fuels production and transportation. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act expands tax benefits to include renewable chemicals, energy efficient buildings, and gasification with sequestration. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act includes provisions for carbon capture and sequestration, requiring at least 75 percent of qualified carbon dioxide to be stored in secure geological storage. This applies to power generation facilities producing electric power from qualified facilities described in section 45Q(c). The provision for carbon capture and sequestration requires power generation units to capture and dispose of qualified carbon dioxide in secure geological storage, with specific percentage requirements based on the date of service. The provision for carbon capture and sequestration mandates facilities to capture and dispose of qualified carbon dioxide in secure geological storage, with specific requirements for power generation units and other qualified facilities. The provision defines a \"qualifying renewable chemical\" as a product produced in the US or its territories from renewable biomass with 95% or higher biobased content, used for production purposes. The provision outlines qualifying renewable chemicals eligible for tax credits, including various chemical products like acetic acid, acrylic acid, and adipic acid, produced from renewable biomass with high biobased content. The provision lists qualifying renewable chemicals eligible for tax credits, including propionic acid, isoprene, itaconic acid, ketals, olefins, polyhydroxyalkonate, polylactic acid, polyitaconic acid, polyols from vegetable oils, and various other chemicals. The biobased content percentage is determined by testing representative samples using specific standards. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to consider applications for listing chemicals under section 7874(d)(6)(A)(vi)(II) within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The amendments made by this section will take effect in taxable years ending after the enactment date."
