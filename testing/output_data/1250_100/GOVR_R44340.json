    "content": "The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 brought significant changes to officer training and career development by establishing a joint management system. This system includes Joint Professional Military Education (JPME), Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL), Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) designation, and joint promotion criteria. The report focuses on JPME requirements and the evolution of JPME over the past 30 years, highlighting stakeholders' concerns for Congress to consider during their GNA review. The Army-Navy Staff College was established in 1943 to train senior officers in joint and combined operations. It evolved into the National War College in 1946. The National War College, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF), and the Armed Forces Staff College (AFSC) were established in 1946 to provide joint operational instruction to mid-grade officers. Despite the availability of joint courses, there was a lack of enthusiasm for joint education and assignments during much of the Cold War era. In 1981, only a small percentage of officers had attended these joint courses. In the early 1980s, concerns arose about the effectiveness of joint military operations, leading to a push for a joint culture within the Department of Defense. General David C. Jones highlighted the need for incentives to encourage top officers to take on joint roles. This initiative eventually led to the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which established requirements for services to train and operate jointly. The Goldwater-Nichols Act established guidelines for joint officer management, focusing on improving quality, experience, and education. Officers could qualify as Joint Specialty Officers (JSOs) by completing JPME requirements and gaining joint experience. JSOs were proficient in \"joint matters\" related to integrated military operations. The Goldwater-Nichols Act established requirements for Joint Specialty Officers (JSOs) to complete JPME programs before being nominated for joint qualification or assigned to joint duty positions. Representative Les Aspin appointed a panel to review the implementation of these education requirements to ensure proper linkage between service competent officers and competent joint officers. The Skelton Panel, chaired by Representative Ike Skelton, recommended a two-phase Joint Specialist Officer (JSO) education process for JPME. Phase I would be taught in service colleges, followed by a temporary Phase II at the Armed Forces Staff College (AFSC). This recommendation was integrated into the FY1990-1991 NDAA as a statement of congressional policy, emphasizing hands-on exercises in the curriculum at AFSC. Exceptions to the sequential instruction were allowed for compelling reasons. The FY1990-1991 NDAA allowed exceptions for compelling reasons in the sequential instruction at AFSC, with a minimum course length of three months. Changes to the joint education system include eligibility of institutions for JPME, distance learning options, and incentives like accredited master's degrees. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 emphasized the roles of military schools in providing professional military education and JPME. The FY1994 NDAA emphasized the importance of professional military education schools for military officers, including expertise in integrated employment of land, sea, and air forces, national security strategy, strategic planning, and command and control of combat operations. It also allowed the National Defense University to confer masters of science degrees in national security strategy and national resource strategy, and provided flexibility in officer assignments after graduation from JPME schools. Some questioned whether the joint officer management system should evolve to reflect changes in doctrine and operations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 mandated an independent study of Joint Officer Management (JOM) and Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) to assess their ability to meet future demands. Booz Allen Hamilton conducted the study, which focused on reviewing JPME sequencing, the utility of joint billets post-JPME, ensuring JPME before joint duty assignments, goals for JFSC attendance, JPME program formats, and increasing JFSC training capacity. The Government Accountability Office also recommended a strategic approach to officer development in line with Goldwater-Nichols implementation. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 mandated an independent study of Joint Officer Management (JOM) and Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) to assess their ability to meet future demands. Booz Allen Hamilton conducted the study, focusing on reviewing JPME sequencing, joint billets post-JPME, JPME before joint duty assignments, JFSC attendance goals, program formats, and increasing JFSC training capacity. In 2003, an independent study recommended updating practice, policy, and law for joint officer management and JPME. The RAND Corporation was then tasked to develop a strategic approach for reforming the joint officer management system, recommending a strategic human resource approach for identifying joint positions, linking them to joint education and experience, and managing officer career paths. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 required DOD to develop a strategic plan for joint officer management and JPME to ensure sufficient qualified officers for service. The FY2005 NDAA mandated a strategic plan for Joint Officer Management and JPME to ensure an adequate number of qualified officers for joint service. The plan required DOD to address promotion eligibility, incentives for completing JPME, entrance examination criteria, civilian enrollment at NDU, and joint specialty qualification for reserve component officers. Additionally, a new chapter in Title 10 United States Code was established to consolidate JPME, specifying definitions, Capstone Course requirements, curriculum content for Phase II, and student and faculty ratios for Phase II institutions. The legislation established a tiered approach to Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) with Phase I, Phase II, and the Capstone Course. DOD submitted a strategic plan in response to FY2005 NDAA requirements, emphasizing joint experience for joint qualification. Congress modified joint officer personnel policy in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007, allowing for different levels of joint qualification and removing the requirement to complete JPME I and II before a joint duty assignment. DOD published an implementation plan for the new Joint Qualification System (JQS) with four levels of qualification. The FY2007 NDAA established a tiered approach to Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) and allowed for different levels of joint qualification. It also introduced the Joint Qualification System (JQS) with dual tracks for earning joint qualifications. The legislation replaced terminology and clarified the schools within the National Defense University. The committee print on Professional Military Education (PME) highlighted concerns about JPME, noting that many officers in joint duty assignments lacked proper JPME qualifications. JPME I was found to be insufficient in preparing officers for joint duty, with completion often tied more to promotion potential than competency development. Competing demands in an officer's career make managing joint education and assignment challenging. The JPME model focuses on building generalists and lacks specific joint competencies. Congress has made minor changes to JPME in recent years, including expanding joint officer management in the National Defense Authorization Act. The DOD established a JPME course at JSOU in response to a five-year pilot program for nonresident JPME II instruction at combatant commands. Legislation now allows senior level service courses to fulfill JPME II requirements if certified by the Secretary of Defense, providing flexibility in completing coursework. Congress has also focused on improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. The Joint Specialty Officers are trained in joint matters related to unified military action across different domains. The FY2016 NDAA added acquisition matters to the list of joint matters, allowing military personnel in acquisition-related assignments to receive joint duty credit. Officers can pursue a dual career track with a primary specialty in combat arms and a sub-specialty in acquisition. The Secretary is encouraged to ensure the curriculum for Phase II joint education includes acquisition topics. The Secretary is encouraged to include acquisition topics in Phase II joint professional military education to enhance performance in acquisition-related fields. Concerns have been raised about the state of joint education within DOD and Congress, leading to a review of the department's structure and efficiency. This review will assess the current law and policy governing joint duty qualifications to ensure they meet joint warfighting requirements. Internal policy changes and legislative adjustments may result from this review. Questions have been raised in the defense community regarding faculty qualifications, curriculum adequacy, and delivery methods of Joint Professional Military Education (JPME). Concerns include the mix of civilian and military faculty, student-to-faculty ratios, curriculum content, and coordination between JPME-granting institutions. Discussions also involve the possibility of earning JPME credit at additional institutions. Questions have been raised in the defense community about the role of JPME in career management and officer development. Key considerations include the balance between service-centric PME and JPME, tying JPME completion to officer promotion, JPME requirements for Reserve Component members, the balance between joint experience and joint education for joint officer qualification, and the effectiveness of existing assignment policies for JPME. Congress may address these issues in the GNA review and future legislative initiatives."
