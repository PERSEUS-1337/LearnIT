The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has been successful in helping small businesses expand. Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will provide more resources to small businesses. Requiring lenders to maintain unnecessarily large loss reserve accounts limits their ability to serve more businesses. Lenders should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk associated with the loan portfolio. Changing the PCLP to require premier certified lenders to maintain loss reserve accounts reflecting loan risk will protect taxpayers and enhance the program's support for small business economic development.
