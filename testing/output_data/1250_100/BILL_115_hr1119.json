    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act\" or the \"SENSE Act\". Standards for coal refuse power plants are established. The \"SENSE Act\" defines key terms related to coal refuse power plants, including the Administrator of the EPA, boiler operating day, coal refuse, and coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit. The \"SENSE Act\" defines terms related to coal refuse power plants, including coal refuse-fired facilities and electric utility steam generating units. It also sets emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide from these facilities. The \"SENSE Act\" allows operators of coal refuse electric utility steam generating units to choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards, but not both. The Administrator will require compliance with emission limitations based on the operator's election. The \"SENSE Act\" allows operators of coal refuse electric utility steam generating units to choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards. The emission standards include limits for hydrogen chloride at 0.002 pounds per million British thermal units or 0.02 pounds per megawatt-hour, and for sulfur dioxide at 0.20 pounds per million British thermal units. The \"SENSE Act\" allows operators of coal refuse electric utility steam generating units to comply with emission standards for sulfur dioxide. The standard is no more stringent than an emission rate of 1.5 pounds per megawatt-hour or capture and control of 93 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions across the generating unit. The measurement of the emission standard is done as a 30 boiler. The emission standard for sulfur dioxide under the \"SENSE Act\" is measured as a 30 boiler operating day rolling average per coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit or group of units at a single coal refuse-fired facility. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 8, 2018. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
