The program has a long history of supporting courses in less commonly taught languages and regions, reflecting federal priorities on diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in federal programs supporting FLAS has increased due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions. Title VI of the Higher Education Act provides grants for foreign language and area studies, focusing on less commonly taught languages and regions. The program supports courses related to diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in these programs has grown due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions. The report discusses reauthorization issues and funding allocation for Title VI programs. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 extended Title VI funding through 2005. Specific authorizations for FY1999 included $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. Most funds are allocated to National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. These programs are the core activities supported under Title VI. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 extended Title VI funding through 2005, with funds allocated to National Language and Area Centers and FLAS Fellowships. Funds are distributed competitively with an emphasis on excellence and equitable distribution. Specific languages or world regions are specified for study under the programs. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and subsequent legislation specified the regions and languages for Title VI funds, aiming to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency in strategic world areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 contained no constraints on language emphasis or fund distribution among programs. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and subsequent legislation specified regions and languages for Title VI funds to train experts with foreign language proficiency in strategic world areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 contained no constraints on language emphasis or fund distribution among programs. One percent of the total appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation, national outreach, and information dissemination, with $1,500,000 allocated for an independent review of Title VI programs by the National Research Council. Funds under the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs, including the utilization of program graduates. The National Foreign Language Center (NFLC) at the University of Maryland conducts evaluations of HEA Title VI programs. The project is developing performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and evaluations for HEA Title VI and Fulbright-Hays programs. It aims to assess the need for advanced foreign language studies and the capacity of institutions to meet those needs. The evaluation system will be phased in over a five-year period. A 2000 report evaluated the impact of foreign language components of HEA Title VI and Fulbright-Hays programs, highlighting their critical importance in maintaining national language capacity. The HEA Title VI support is crucial for maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages, which are strategically important for the United States. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a majority of graduate students in these languages. Title VI grants have also supported the development of textbooks in these languages. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress, with discussions on related issues likely to be debated. It is important for the nation to provide sufficient education and support to address increasing interactions between American society and cultures worldwide, which can raise national security concerns. The importance of providing ongoing support for instruction in all of the world's major languages and cultures, including those of current concern like Afghanistan, is crucial. The question is not whether support is important for instruction in \"critical\" foreign languages and cultures, but rather if such support should be provided by the federal government and focused on colleges and universities. The federal government operates two foreign language schools, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center in Monterey, California, and the Foreign Service Institute School for Language Studies in Arlington, Virginia. Title VI provides grants to institutions for educational programs in specific subject areas, unlike the general approach of the Higher Education Act (HEA) which focuses on student aid based on financial need. Title VI offers institutional aid for specific fields and fellowships for students in those fields. Title VI is a HEA program focused on specific subject areas, particularly foreign languages and regions important for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. Advocates argue that supporting research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority, essential for federal employees, international trade, diplomacy, and public outreach to increase understanding of foreign nations and cultures. The quality of FLAS programs in higher education institutions depends on linkages with foreign educational institutions, easier to establish in colleges and universities than in federal institutions. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique, as other federal agencies also provide support for instruction in specific subject areas on a larger scale. The federal government provides targeted support for science, mathematics, foreign languages, and area studies in higher education institutions. It is suggested that if there is enough student interest, institutions will offer adequate instruction without federal subsidies. If federal aid is necessary, it could be limited to start-up costs rather than ongoing support. Efforts could also be made to utilize the language skills of recent immigrants. Private foundations occasionally support Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) programs. Private foundations, corporations, and IHEs provide support for FLAS programs. Title VI funding matches grants and helps sustain instruction in critical languages like Pashto and Farsi. Proponents argue for federal support to ensure adequate funding for national needs. The report focuses on Title VI reauthorization as the main federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges and universities. Title VI is the largest federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges and universities. There are other related programs that may need better coordination with Title VI for efficiency. The primary federal programs related to Title VI include the Fulbright-Hays Act, NSEP, Gilman International Scholarship Program, and international activities under ED's FIPSE. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities primarily administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State. These activities involve exchanges of graduate students, scholars, and professionals in various fields, with a focus on improving FLAS instruction in American colleges and universities. The Fulbright-Hays programs administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education support foreign travel-related activities for American graduate students and professors, such as faculty research abroad, doctoral dissertation research, and group seminars abroad. These programs are available only to U.S. citizens and are smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. It offers scholarships, grants to institutions for language and area studies programs, and fellowships for graduate students. A trust fund of $150 million was established in FY1992 for this purpose. Recipients of NSEP funding are required to seek employment in a national security position for a limited period. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) offers scholarships and grants for international education and language studies. Recipients must seek employment in a national security position or work in higher education related to their scholarship. Institutional grants focus on supporting language programs, increasing minority participation in international education, and integrating foreign language studies with professional education. A revised strategy starting in 2003 includes a Flagship Language Initiative for advanced study of critical foreign languages. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) complements foreign language and area studies programs authorized under HEA Title VI. It includes unique elements such as a service requirement and support for travel grants to undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, NSEP determines critical nations, disciplines, and subject areas for national security. The program is largely administered through non-governmental organizations. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is administered through non-governmental organizations, such as the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students and the Academy for Educational Development (AED) for graduate fellowship competition. The program began making grants in 1994-1995 and faced budget cuts in the past. NSEP focuses on meeting national security-related FLAS skill needs, has a service requirement, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. The NSEP is a small program administered by DOD, not ED, providing scholarships for undergraduate students to study abroad. Recipients must be Pell Grant recipients from low-income families, with preference given to first-time study abroad students. The scholarships cover travel costs, tuition, and related expenses, with no specific focus on language or region. The Gilman program, administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education, provides study abroad opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to participate. In the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) administers programs to foster innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education, with targeted support for international education programs under three specific programs. The programs provide multi-year grants to U.S. IHEs to collaborate with foreign institutions for student and staff exchange, curriculum development. Funding levels for FY2002 are $2,043,000 for North American Mobility, $1,495,000 for U.S.-Brazil Consortia, and $2,254,000 for European-US Cooperation Program. Consolidation of these programs under a national strategy is questioned for efficiency, but their smaller scale compared to Title VI may diminish the need for coordination. The Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP institutional grant programs are similar to activities funded by HEA Title VI. Coordination and efficiency could be improved by consolidating or placing them under a single advisory board. NSEP's emphasis on national security needs and service requirement for aid recipients set it apart. Coordination with NSEP may align better with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI. Operating a separate program with similar purposes as Title VI raises questions about efficiency. The NSEP's viability is in question due to reduced trust fund, while the Gilman International Scholarship lacks a national security focus. Transferring Gilman to ED and creating a multi-agency board for federal programs in foreign language and international studies could be considered. A multi-agency board for federal programs in foreign language and international studies could coordinate long-range planning to meet national needs for specialists. Coordination between HEA Title VI funded IHEs and federal agencies offering language instruction should be increased for better resource sharing and program coordination. The need for targeted federal assistance in critical areas such as the Middle East and South Asia, as well as Western Europe, raises questions about decision-making regarding funding allocation for language and region-specific programs. Options include ED alone, ED through an interagency advisory body, a new entity for federal FLAS programs, or Congress. The HEA Title VI programs require federal funds to be matched with non-federal resources, leading to additional funding from various sources. However, there are concerns about whether the current scale of federal support is sufficient to meet national needs. Opponents argue against increased targeting of grants for specific languages and regions, citing uncertainty in predicting future critical areas. The uncertainty in predicting future critical areas makes it challenging to determine the focus of grants. It is suggested to rely on the initiative of IHEs to submit proposals for Title VI grants supporting a comprehensive range of languages and regions. Efforts to quantify national needs include an annual survey linked to the NSEP and a recent study by the General Accounting Office on foreign languages and world regions of major national security interest. The General Accounting Office report highlighted shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills in federal agencies like the Army, State Department, Department of Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service, and the FBI. These shortages have negatively impacted agency operations and hindered various U.S. efforts in military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic fields due to the changing security environment and increasing globalization of the U.S. economy."
