    "content": "Credit for clinical testing research expenses attributable to certain qualified academic institutions including teaching hospitals is provided under section 41A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The medical innovation credit under section 38 allows for a 20 percent credit on qualified medical innovation expenses exceeding the medical innovation base period amount. Qualified expenses include payments to qualified academic institutions for clinical testing research activities conducted before product approval. The term 'product' refers to any drug, biologic, or medical device. A 'qualified academic institution' includes educational institutions affiliated with higher education. The term 'qualified medical innovation expenses' excludes amounts funded by grants. A teaching hospital must be publicly supported or owned by a 501(c)(3) organization and affiliated with an organization meeting certain requirements. A foundation must be a medical research organization affiliated with a 501(c)(3) organization or a teaching hospital meeting specific criteria. A charitable research hospital is designated as a cancer center by the National Cancer Institute. The term 'qualified medical innovation expenses' excludes amounts funded by grants or contracts from another person or governmental entity. The 'medical innovation base period amount' is the average annual qualified medical innovation expenses over a 3-taxable year period. Special rules include no credit for clinical testing research conducted outside the US and certain rules from section 41 apply. Taxpayers must elect for this section to apply in a taxable year. The section allows for a credit for qualified medical innovation expenses in a taxable year, which does not affect other research or clinical testing credits. The credit is part of the general business credit under the tax code. The new paragraph prohibits the carryback of the medical innovation credit before January 1, 1999. Additionally, it denies a double benefit by disallowing a deduction for the portion of qualified medical innovation expenses equal to the credit determined for the taxable year. The tax code is amended to redefine business credits and add a new medical innovation expenses credit. The table of sections is also updated to reflect these changes. The new paragraph restricts the carryback of the medical innovation credit and prevents a double benefit by disallowing a deduction for qualified medical innovation expenses equal to the credit. The tax code is amended to include a new credit for medical innovation expenses, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1998."
