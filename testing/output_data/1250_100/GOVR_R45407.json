    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, with federal policy emphasizing the importance of good pre-service teacher preparation. The Higher Education Act of 1965 includes provisions in Title II, Part A to support and hold teacher preparation programs accountable. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the HEA, with H.R. 4508 proposing changes to teacher preparation programs. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce reported a bill to repeal provisions in Title II, while another bill introduced by the ranking minority member aims to amend and extend Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various legislation, including P.L. 115-245. Congressional action to reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA) may continue, with key issues surrounding pre-service teacher preparation programs. Pre-service teacher preparation in the United States has historically been focused on institutions of higher education (IHEs), with traditional programs and schools of education receiving federal support. The rise of alternative teacher preparation approaches has posed challenges to existing federal policies, especially regarding program quality accountability. Teacher training in the U.S. has evolved from normal schools to universities establishing schools and colleges of education, leading to the professionalization of teacher educators and a formalized split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines. In recent years, the split between training in teaching practice and subject-matter expertise has widened with the rise of alternative routes to teacher certification. These alternative approaches focus on candidate's prior knowledge of the subject they will teach and training for classroom instruction and management. The Secretary of Education is required to prepare an annual report on teacher preparation in the United States, with the most recent data available for the 2012-2013 academic year. Additional data for subsequent years is also available online. In the 2015-2016 academic year, 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among the providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 89% of teacher candidates were enrolled in traditional teacher preparation programs, while 5% were in alternative route programs at IHEs, and 6% were in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states accounted for 35% of teacher preparation program completers, with Texas leading in alternative route completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. Traditional programs require 100 hours of clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs are online: Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix. Most enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic. The most common subject area in traditional programs is elementary education. The national average scaled score for teacher preparation programs was 14 percentage points above the average cut score, with over 95% of candidates passing state assessments. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting provisions to improve teacher quality. The Teacher Quality Partnership program aims to enhance teacher preparation and professional development activities. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program supports teacher preparation programs for new teachers, including traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year programs and teacher residency programs. It provides grant funding for school leadership activities as well. The program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to around two dozen partnerships. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, a school of education within the institution, and a school of arts. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires grantees to match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and collaborate with other federally funded programs. Grants support reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, clinical education, mentoring, induction programs, and initiatives to increase compensation for early childhood educators. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program provides grants for developing high-quality professional development for teachers, recruiting qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grants support teacher residency programs that offer rigorous graduate-level coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for professional collaboration. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program provides grants for developing high-quality professional development for teachers, recruiting qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grants also include a one-year living stipend for cohort members, who must teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school and subject. The program aims to develop effective school leadership programs to prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, or other school leaders. The Title II of the Higher Education Act (HEA) includes provisions to hold teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and institutions to report program performance. States must report to receive HEA funds, while institutions must report if they enroll students receiving federal assistance. The HEA mandates the use of state-reported information to issue an annual report on teacher qualifications and preparation. States are also required to evaluate teacher preparation programs, identify low-performing programs, and establish criteria for program evaluations. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs using criteria like teaching skill and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Some states also considered improving student achievement, raising entry standards, and increasing professional development. 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing programs. 45 programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk, representing less than 3% of total programs. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved the H.R. 4508 bill in 2018, which would amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) by repealing Title II provisions. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending Title II provisions including changes to the TQP program, accountability provisions for institutions and states, and expanding accountability measures. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations that would have added clearer guidance on provider versus program, post-program completion measures, and penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation reauthorizing the HEA, including Title II provisions, addressing federal support for teacher preparation programs and TQP authorized activities. Some argue for expanding federal support for teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities under the TQP program, with traditional teaching routes seeking more support for clinical practice and assessments. Some argue for expanding federal support for teacher preparation programs, favoring fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring. They believe current reporting and accountability provisions are inadequate in holding programs to high standards. Advocates for greater accountability propose program evaluations tied to student performance outcomes, while others argue against federal accountability requirements, citing existing burdens on state and local administrators."
