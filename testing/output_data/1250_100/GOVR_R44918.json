    "content": "Federal financial regulation is complex, with diverse markets, participants, and regulators. The regulatory structure has evolved over time, with major changes made in response to financial crises. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 was a significant reform in response to the 2007 financial turmoil. Congress is currently debating proposals to modify the regulatory system, including the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. The report discusses proposed changes to financial regulation, including restructuring the Financial Stability Oversight Council and eliminating the Office of Financial Research. It also provides an overview of federal financial regulators and other entities involved in regulation. The financial system matches funds of savers and investors with borrowers and others seeking funds. Financial firms act as intermediaries or agents, issuing obligations to savers and making loans or investments for profits. Regulators oversee the myriad products, instruments, and markets used in banking, insurance, and securities. Securities include debt and equity contracts, with derivatives being a special class of securities. Derivatives are financial contracts based on underlying assets. Financial Market Infrastructure includes trade data dissemination and payment systems. The U.S. regulatory system is fragmented due to overlapping authority. \"Shadow banking\" involves activities similar to formal banks but in securities markets. Financial regulation has evolved over time in response to market failures. Regulators have varying powers, goals, and approaches across markets. They focus on licensing, chartering, or registration to oversee activities. Regulators implement policy using their powers to achieve specific goals and regulate firms, individuals, or markets. Financial activities require proper credentials from state or federal regulators, such as licenses or charters. These credentials dictate the permitted activities, with failure to comply resulting in penalties or revocation. Regulators issue rules to implement statutory mandates. Regulators enforce statutory mandates through oversight, supervision, and enforcement powers. This includes monitoring market participants' behavior, issuing fines and penalties, and revoking licenses for non-compliance. Regulators have the authority to enforce statutory mandates through oversight, supervision, and enforcement powers, including monitoring market participants' behavior, issuing fines, and revoking licenses. They can also initiate legal action in response to complaints and have the power to resolve failing firms through conservatorship or receivership. Financial regulation aims to ensure market efficiency and integrity by promoting transparency, market confidence, liquidity, low costs, and fair trading practices. Regulators contribute to market integrity by ensuring transparency, enforcing contracts, and setting and enforcing rules. They also address market failures like principal-agent problems, asymmetric information, and moral hazard. Regulators protect consumers and investors from fraud, discrimination, manipulation, and theft, and ensure access to credit and capital for firms and consumers to promote economic growth. Regulators ensure market integrity by enforcing rules, preventing illicit activities, and protecting taxpayers from financial losses. They aim to provide access to credit and capital for economic growth while preventing criminal and terrorist use of the financial system. In times of financial crisis, governments may provide funds in unconventional ways to restore stability, such as the bailouts of large failing firms in 2008. Financial regulation aims to maintain stability by mitigating systemic risk, as seen in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Instability can be localized or more widespread, impacting the real economy. Systemic risk can arise beyond banking, highlighting the need for comprehensive regulatory measures. Regulation aims to balance consumer protections with market efficiency and capital formation. Prudential regulation focuses on ensuring institutions' safety and soundness through risk management, such as capital requirements for banks. Regulatory goals may conflict, requiring regulators to find a middle ground to minimize burdens and maximize benefits. Prudential regulation involves capital requirements for banks to ensure safety and soundness. Disclosure and reporting requirements aim to provide accurate financial information to the public and regulators. Standard setting by regulators establishes permissible activities and behavior for market participants to achieve policy goals like market integrity and taxpayer protection. Regulators enforce rules to prevent conflicts of interest, risky activities, discrimination, and ensure suitability in financial products. They also oversee competition to prevent monopoly power and price manipulation. Price and rate regulations are set to control maximum or minimum prices, fees, and interest rates. Federal regulation, such as the Durbin Amendment, caps debit interchange fees for large banks. State-level regulations include usury laws and insurance rate regulation. Price and rate regulations aim to protect consumers and investors. Prudential regulation in banking focuses on financial stability and taxpayer protection, while securities regulation emphasizes disclosure. Regulatory goals differ due to the importance of taxpayer exposure and potential contagion in banking. Prudential regulation relies on confidential information gathered through examinations. Federal securities regulation aims to ensure investors are informed about investment risks through proper disclosure. Regulation varies based on financial market characteristics and historical evolution. Regulators oversee different categories, including regulating specific types of financial institutions like depository institutions and government-sponsored enterprises. The Finance Authority (FHFA) regulates three government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs): Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system, overseeing their activities and behavior. Regulators may also regulate specific markets or financial activities to ensure proper conduct and oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to regulate financial products offered to consumers by various firms, ensuring uniform consumer financial protections. Regulators may need to determine jurisdiction over financial activities that span multiple markets or firms. Regulatory approaches must align to effectively mitigate risks arising from firms, markets, or products. Market innovation can lead to new financial instruments that challenge industry divisions. Congress and courts often decide on agency jurisdiction in such cases. The federal financial regulatory structure categorizes regulators into banking, securities, and insurance areas. Financial firms may be overseen by multiple regulators due to engaging in various financial activities. Holding companies with separate legal subsidiaries allow for engagement in different markets. The complexity of regulatory oversight is illustrated in Figure 1. The federal financial regulatory structure categorizes regulators into banking, securities, and insurance areas. Holding companies with legal subsidiaries allow for engagement in different markets. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 enabled conglomerates to have different legal subsidiaries within the same financial holding company. Each subsidiary is assigned a primary regulator, leading to multiple institution regulators for firms with multiple subsidiaries. If the holding company is a bank or thrift holding company, it is regulated by the Fed. The federal financial regulatory structure categorizes regulators into banking, securities, and insurance areas. Holding companies with legal subsidiaries allow for engagement in different markets. A financial holding company is regulated by the Fed at the holding company level, with its national bank regulated by the OCC, securities subsidiary by the SEC, and loan company possibly by the CFPB. Regulation of depository institutions in the US involves multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions in a dual banking system. Depository institutions have different types of charters\u2014commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions, each regulated by different primary federal regulators. National banks and thrifts are regulated by the OCC, state-chartered banks in the Federal Reserve System by the Federal Reserve, state-chartered thrifts and banks not in the system by the FDIC, and foreign banks by the Fed or OCC. Credit unions are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration. All institutions are also subject to FDIC regulatory authority. Regulatory responsibilities are illustrated in Figure 3, with credit unions having a separate regulatory framework. Banks are subject to safety and soundness regulation at the federal level, which evaluates each loan, the institution's balance sheet, and overall system risks. They must keep capital reserves for potential losses and maintain liquidity for unexpected funding outflows. Federal regulators ensure banks' stability and their role in the financial system. The federal financial regulators evaluate banks' balance sheets to ensure they are liquid enough to meet unexpected funding outflows. Regulators have tools to reduce risks, such as requiring banks to adjust lending practices or dispose of assets. Banks must comply with regulators' directives, as they have the authority to withdraw deposit insurance or seize the bank. Additionally, banks are subject to regulation by the OCC, CFPB, SEC, and CFTC for consumer protection and market activities. The OCC, established in 1863, supervises federally chartered banks and has examination powers to ensure their safety. It can issue cease and desist orders and revoke federal bank charters. The FDIC, created in 1933, insures deposits up to $250,000, examines financial institutions, and manages receiverships. The FDIC is the primary federal regulator of state banks and thrift institutions, managing receiverships and disposing of assets of failed banks. It backs deposit insurance through the DIF, funded by assessments on depository institutions. The FDIC examines and regulates insured depository institutions to ensure safety and soundness, with powers to resolve troubled banks under \"prompt corrective action\" and \"least cost resolution\" principles. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded its role in resolving troubled financial institutions. The Federal Reserve System, established in 1913 after the Panic of 1907, consists of the Board of Governors and 12 regional reserve banks. It regulates various lending institutions, including bank holding companies and state-chartered banks. Membership is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks, with members required to purchase stock in the Fed. The Fed also serves as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies under the GLBA and as the primary regulator for systemically significant nonbank financial firms designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets and designated nonbanks are subject to enhanced prudential regulation by the Fed. The Federal Reserve System regulates lending institutions, conducts monetary policy, and acts as a lender of last resort. It also sets prudential standards for payment systems. The NCUA is the safety and soundness regulator for federal credit unions and administers a Central Liquidity Facility. The NCUA administers a Central Liquidity Facility and insures credit union deposits. The CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to enhance consumer protection and regulate various financial products and services. The CFPB administers rules to protect consumers in financial transactions, setting disclosure and suitability standards, and banning abusive practices. It supervises and enforces federal consumer protection laws for institutions offering financial products and services, with regulatory authority based on institution size and type. The bureau can issue rules for all depository institutions but only supervises those with over $10 billion in assets. Depositories with less than $10 billion are supervised by their primary regulator for consumer compliance. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts certain entities and activities from the CFPB's oversight. The CFPB administers rules to protect consumers in financial transactions, supervising and enforcing federal consumer protection laws for institutions offering financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts certain entities like merchants, retailers, automobile dealers, real estate brokers, and insurance companies from CFPB oversight. Securities markets are regulated by the CFTC or SEC, with banking regulators overseeing securities activities of banks. Standard-setting bodies and self-regulatory organizations play a role in securities regulation overseen by the SEC or CFTC. The New York Stock Exchange was established in 1793. After the stock market crash of 1929, the SEC was created in 1934 to enforce federal securities laws. The SEC has jurisdiction over participants in securities markets, securities markets themselves, and securities products. Its main focus is on protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. The SEC's main focus is on protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. Firms selling securities must register with the SEC, providing detailed information about the firm, management, fund usage, and risks to investors. The SEC does not have direct regulatory control over publicly traded firms beyond disclosure requirements and certain rules on corporate governance. Regulators supervise institutions to identify unsafe banking practices and prevent excessive risks. The SEC requires disclosure of risks to investors but does not guarantee the safety of investments. Various securities market participants must register with the SEC to protect investors, prevent fraud, and ensure fair markets. Accredited investors with high net worth can invest in riskier funds. Regulatory exemptions were originally granted to mutual funds and investment advisers. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, private advisers like hedge funds and private equity funds with over $150 million in assets must register with the SEC. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insures customer accounts up to $500,000 for losses from brokerage failure or fraud. SIPC does not protect against market losses or regulate broker-dealers. Some securities markets, like foreign exchange, are exempt from certain regulations. The foreign exchange market is crucial for global trade and has a significant impact on a country's macroeconomic policy. It operates among various entities such as global banks, central banks, hedge funds, and retail brokers through electronic platforms. Unlike other markets, there is no centralized marketplace for trading currencies. Treasury securities were exempted from SEC regulation in the 1930s but were later required to register under the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993. The government securities market is lightly regulated compared to corporate securities markets. The SEC has no jurisdiction over the primary market, municipal securities, or private securities. Municipal securities were exempt from SEC regulation until the creation of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in 1975. Private securities are not subject to the same registration and disclosure requirements as public securities. Private securities, unlike public securities, are not subject to registration and disclosure requirements by the SEC. Instead, they are subject to antifraud provisions of federal securities laws and can only be offered to accredited investors. The private placement market fluctuates in size, sometimes exceeding the public market in value. Venture capitalists and private equity firms play significant roles in corporate finance, with venture capitalists investing in private firms and private equity firms acquiring publicly traded companies. The CFTC was established in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets, expanding beyond agricultural commodities to include financial variables. The CFTC was given exclusive jurisdiction over options and futures contracts, but off-exchange derivatives like swaps grew. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded CFTC's authority, requiring registration for swap dealers and clearing organizations. Dodd-Frank Act repealed exemptions for certain over-the-counter derivatives after the financial crisis, including AIG's federal rescue due to large losses. The CFTC oversees SROs, industry firms, and personnel, focusing on preventing excessive speculation, manipulation, and fraud. It requires swaps to be cleared through central clearinghouses and traded on exchanges. SROs must create rules for disciplining members and ensuring market integrity and investor protection. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act granted the SEC and CFTC additional regulatory authority over clearing and settlement systems deemed systemically important. Standard-setting bodies like FINRA, MSRB, and NFA play a crucial role in setting rules and standards for securities and futures market participants. SROs are responsible for ensuring market integrity and investor protection by creating and enforcing rules for members. The NFA, FASB, and PCAOB are standard-setting bodies that enforce rules in futures markets, establish accounting standards, and oversee private auditors. They are private nonprofits funded through member fees and have rulemaking powers delegated by regulators. GSEs are privately owned institutions with limited missions overseen by dedicated regulators like the FHFA and FCA. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created the FHFA to regulate GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, transferring authority from HUD. Concerns about systemic risks led to the FHFA's establishment to oversee GSEs with large mortgage portfolios. The FHFA was established in 2008 to regulate GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with enhanced safety and soundness powers. It placed both GSEs in conservatorship to prevent failure and received warrants for a 79.9% equity ownership position in return for providing $187 billion in capital. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) was established in 1933 during a farming crisis to regulate the Farm Credit System, which includes cooperatively owned Farm Credit Banks, Agricultural Credit Banks, the Funding Corporation, and Farmer Mac. Unlike housing GSEs, the FCA oversees primary and secondary agricultural credit markets, ensuring safety and soundness through capital requirements. Interagency organizations like the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets coordinate data sharing among regulators. In 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner highlighted key issues in the financial system: lack of oversight and risk constraints. Regulatory failures contributed to the economic crisis by allowing institutions to become extremely vulnerable. Systemic risk arises when individual firms manage risk independently, leading to overall instability. Regulators overseeing specific sectors may miss systemic threats, contributing to financial instability. The Federal Reserve was previously the default systemic regulator, with limited authority to prevent crises. The Dodd-Frank Act established the FSOC to detect systemic stress and coordinate with various regulatory heads to prevent cascading losses. The FSOC, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, consists of various state and federal financial regulators. It is responsible for identifying and responding to risks to financial stability, promoting market discipline, proposing regulatory changes, facilitating information sharing among regulators, and providing a forum for resolving disputes. The council must provide an annual report and may make regulatory recommendations but cannot impose resolutions on disagreeing members. The FSOC, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, consists of various state and federal financial regulators. It is responsible for identifying and responding to risks to financial stability, promoting market discipline, proposing regulatory changes, and facilitating information sharing among regulators. The council can make regulatory recommendations but cannot impose resolutions on disagreeing members. The Dodd-Frank Act did not give the council authority to respond to emerging threats or close regulatory gaps, but it designates firms as systemically important, subjecting them to a more stringent supervisory regime administered by the Fed. The FFIEC, established in 1979, coordinates federal regulation of lending institutions through the issuance of reporting forms and harmonization of auditing principles. It comprises the Fed, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, NCUA, and State Liaison Committee representatives who enforce safety and soundness regulations. Examiners evaluate risks and monitor lenders based on handbooks covering areas like capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, and market risk sensitivity. Insurance companies have been regulated by states for 150 years without federal oversight. Insurance companies have been regulated by states for the past 150 years without federal oversight. The limited federal role in insurance regulation is due to Supreme Court decisions and congressional actions. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 specifically preserves states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the industry. Each state has its own department regulating insurance companies, solvency, product content, and market conduct, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners acting as a coordinating body. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) sets national standards through model laws and regulations, which must be enacted by states. States have guaranty funds to protect policyholders in case of insurer insolvency. The federal government's role in insurance regulation has increased over time, with federal oversight through laws like GLBA and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve regulates bank holding companies with insurance operations and insurers designated as systemically important. The Dodd-Frank Act created the FIO to monitor the insurance industry and represent the US internationally. Various federal laws exempt aspects of state insurance regulation. State regulation extends beyond insurance to banking and securities markets. While federal laws exempt certain aspects of state insurance regulation, state regulators still play a significant role in nonbank consumer financial protection. Banking operates under a dual system where institutions can choose to charter at the state or federal level. State-chartered banks outnumber nationally chartered banks, but the latter hold more assets. Similarly, nationally chartered thrifts have a majority of thrift assets despite being fewer in number. Federal regulators still oversee state-chartered banks, despite state regulators being their primary regulators. State-chartered banks have state regulators as their primary regulators, but federal regulators also play a role. Most depositories have FDIC deposit insurance and must meet federal safety and soundness standards. The Federal Reserve supervises many state banks, while nonmember Fed banks are supervised by the FDIC. Blue sky laws in securities markets allow for concurrent state regulation to protect investors against fraud. States oversee investment advisers exempt from SEC registration based on size, while broker-dealers are subject to both state and federal regulations. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 invalidated state securities laws in various areas to reduce overlap with federal regulations. States enforce regulations against financial institutions, especially in states with large financial industries like New York. Federal regulation determines the scope of state regulation through preemption and \"wild card\" laws. U.S. regulators must consider global financial markets, including foreign firms operating in the United States. U.S. regulators and foreign regulators must coordinate on regulating financial firms operating across jurisdictions to maintain consistency. International standards are set through collaboration in international fora, with U.S. policymakers playing a significant role. These standards, though not legally binding, are typically implemented through rulemaking or legislation. Multiple international standard-setting bodies oversee different areas of financial regulation. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, IOSCO, and IAIS are key standard-setting bodies in financial regulation. The G-20 led international coordination of regulatory reform post-financial crisis, creating the FSB. The FSB works with finance ministers, regulators, and international institutions to implement regulatory reform, aligning with the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 established new federal entities for financial regulation, including the FSOC, OFR, FIO, and CFPB. The CFPB was granted new authority and transferred existing authority from other regulators. The Act also eliminated the OTS and transferred its authority to banking regulators. The HERA created the FHFA and eliminated the OFHEO and FHFB. The HERA granted the FHFA new authority and transferred existing authority from HUD, OFHEO, and FHFB."
