    "content": "The report highlights the Department of Defense's alternative fuel initiatives, including testing, certification, and investments in biofuel production. The DOD and military services have spent millions on alternative fuels, with the Navy proposing a significant investment. This report also provides data on DOD's alternative fuels purchases and the status of testing platforms for alternative fuel blends. The report discusses the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, including funding and legislative actions related to alternative fuels efforts. It also provides an overview of the Department of Defense's operational energy efforts, with responsibility for alternative fuels initiatives given to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs now leads DOD's alternative fuels initiatives and policy, overseeing investments, issuing guidelines, and promoting collaboration with other federal agencies. Sharon Burke issued a memorandum outlining the goals of DOD's alternative fuels policy to ensure military readiness and increase fuel source flexibility. DOD's alternative fuels initiatives aim to enhance expeditionary effectiveness by using drop-in fuels that are cost-competitive and available in sufficient quantities. Investments must meet specific criteria, including being produced from non-food crop feedstock and having lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs oversees these initiatives and certifies budgets for implementing the operational energy strategy. The annual operational energy report now includes alternative fuels initiatives with descriptions, funding, and expenditures. Future investments in alternative fuels will undergo a rigorous, merit-based evaluation. DOD's alternative fuels development follows three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Ongoing Purchases. Alternative fuels will compete with petroleum products for operational quantities. The military services have set goals for increasing the use of alternative fuels. The Army aims to have 25% of energy for power generation and 50% of fuel for the tactical mobility fleet from renewable sources by 2028. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. The Air Force and Navy have set ambitious goals for using alternative fuels. The Air Force aims to test all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012, while the Navy plans to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet\" by 2016 and meet 50% of its energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. The Department of Defense (DOD) aims to replace approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum used afloat with unblended alternative fuels by 2020. DLA Energy has procured about 1.9 million gallons of various types of alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force since 2007. DOD has spent around $48 million on alternative fuels to test engine performance and certify them for service fleets. The services have purchased Fischer-Tropsch fuels, biofuels, and alcohol-to-jet fuels among others. The Navy and Air Force have purchased alternative fuels derived from bio-based feedstocks and the Fischer-Tropsch process. DOD is restricted from buying alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional petroleum fuels. DOD's position is that this restriction does not apply to bulk fuel purchases. Army, Navy, and Air Force are involved in alternative fuels initiatives. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use. The Army is testing 50:50 blends of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet with JP-8 for ground systems and field generators. They aim to certify these fuels by 2014. The Army is also working on Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters to fly on the 50:50 FT-SPK: JP-8 blend. The Army plans to complete testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by the end of FY2014. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets. Testing has been done on biofuels as well. The Air Force and Navy have completed testing on biofuels for their fleets, including HEFA fuels and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft and ships, with certification expected in early 2013. Fischer-Tropsch fuels testing is ongoing, with completion expected by the end of 2013. Other alternative fuels like pyrolysis oils and direct sugar to hydrocarbon will continue to be tested. In June 2011, the Departments of the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The Departments of the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry. The MOU calls for government investment to achieve adequate domestic production capacity of advanced drop-in biofuels. The Navy and Department of Energy plan to fund the initiative with $340 million in federal funds, with industry cost-sharing. The Department of Agriculture will provide an additional $171 million to support biofuel feedstocks. The government funding for the biofuels production initiative is anticipated to be $510 million over three years, with contributions from the Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) was released in June 2012 with an initial funding amount of $210 million. Awards for biofuels production facilities will be given in two phases: Phase 1 for planning and preliminary designs, and Phase 2 for construction and testing. Successful proposals require at least 50% cost share for both phases. The proposal for biofuels production initiative requires at least 50% cost share for both Phase 1 and Phase 2, domestic production of advanced biofuels with domestic feedstocks, compliance with Section 526 of the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007, use of acceptable renewable feedstock, production of drop-in fuel, cost-competitiveness with petroleum-based fuels, and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons a year. The FOA funding level of $210 million includes contributions from DOD, Navy, and DOE, but not USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. The Commodity Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion to subsidize bio-based jet fuel production. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on expanding or limiting DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels. H.R. 4310 contained provisions exempting DOD from EISA requirements and limiting its alternative fuel purchases. The Senate passed S. 3254 in 2012 without restrictions on DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels. Amendments restricting biofuels provisions were removed during floor debate. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act stated that DOD funds for biofuels production require matching contributions from DOE and USDA. The Departments of Defense and Energy requested $70 million and $40 million for the biofuels production initiative in FY2013. The Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture are involved in the initiative, with funds provided through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the $70 million request, while the Senate recommended funding the Defense Production Act Fund at $100 million. The Department of Defense requested $70 million for biofuels production in FY2013, but the funding was reduced to $60 million in the Defense Production Act Fund. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels. The overall DPA Fund was funded at $100 million, with a total of $189 million appropriated in the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The conferees allocated $20 million for research on improving emissions from coal to liquid fuel to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees before using these funds. The House version of the FY2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act does not allow the Department of Energy to transfer money into the Defense Production Act Fund. The Department of Energy can transfer up to $100 million of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds into the Defense Production Act Fund. The funding for DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy was approximately $1.8 billion under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. Congress is considering oversight questions regarding the benefits of alternative fuels for the services, funding for testing and certification efforts, and coordination among the services. The Navy is leading the effort to jumpstart a domestic advanced biofuels industry and coordinating alternative fuel goals among military services. Questions arise about coordination, funding, and oversight of alternative fuels testing and certification efforts within the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is exploring changes in alternative fuel initiatives and coordination with other federal agencies. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocated $150 million for DPA Title III funding, supporting biofuels production. Senate reports encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The Department of Defense is encouraged to pursue long-term contracts for biofuels products to maximize efficiencies of scale and ensure adequate production. The House Appropriations Committee supports the Department's investments in biofuels and alternative energy, emphasizing the potential benefits for the Nation's armed forces and overall national interests. The Department of Energy requested funds to transfer to the DPA Fund for biofuel projects. The House-passed version of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act did not authorize this transfer, citing a decrease in funding for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D. The Department of Energy requested funding for a joint initiative with the Navy and the Department of Agriculture to develop biofuels production capacity for defense purposes. The recommendation does not include funding for this initiative. The Secretary may transfer up to $100,000,000 to the Defense Production Act Fund for Department of Energy activities. The report supports a joint biofuel production initiative involving the DOD, DOE, and USDA. The collaboration aims to develop innovative technologies for military jet and diesel fuels, with the Department of Defense as an early adopter to encourage wider marketplace acceptance. Provisions in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act impact the DOD's procurement and production of biofuels. SEC. 313 exempts the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements. SEC. 314 limits funds for alternative fuel procurement by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification. S. 3254 passed by the Senate on December 4, 2012, does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. Two provisions affecting biofuel procurement were removed via floor amendments. S.Amdt. 2985, sponsored by Senator Mark Udall, struck Section 313 limiting the purchase of alternative fuels exceeding traditional fossil fuel costs. S.Amdt. 3095, sponsored by Senator Hagan, limited funds for alternative fuel procurement in fiscal year 2013. The Senate passed S. 3254 on December 4, 2012, without restricting the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. Amendments removed provisions limiting the purchase of alternative fuels exceeding traditional fossil fuel costs. Schumer, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Coons, Udall (NM), Tester, and Udall (CO) struck Section 2823, which would have prohibited the Department of Defense from entering into certain biofuels contracts without specific authorization. Amendments sponsored by Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain were also removed. SEC. 313 of S. 3254 limits funds for procurement of alternative fuel if cost exceeds traditional fossil fuel. Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities for certification. SEC. 2823 prohibiting biofuel refinery construction was removed by amendments. The Department of Defense is prohibited from entering into contracts for biofuel refinery construction unless authorized by law. Funds for alternative fuel procurement are limited if the cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. In 2011, the Department of the Navy purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million. The Department of the Navy made the largest biofuel purchase in government history at $26.66 a gallon to demonstrate the Carrier Strike Group's ability to use alternative fuels. The high cost of fuel impacts readiness accounts, with every $1 increase in fuel prices resulting in $31M of additional costs annually. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies. The committee is concerned about the high costs of biofuels being used for RDTE efforts and directs the Secretary of Defense to develop guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315 limits the obligation of Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The House Appropriations Committee report for the 2013 fiscal year includes $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuel production, with concerns about stockpiling funds ahead of need and no funding provided for fiscal year 2013. The Secretary of Defense is urged to request funding for this effort. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for the 2013 fiscal year provides an additional $100 million for the Defense Production Act (DPA) fund, recognizing its importance in strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base. The funding is to be competitively awarded to new initiatives, with priority given to completing DPA projects from previous years. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is directed to inform congressional defense committees 30 days before any funds are obligated or spent. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) includes $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, with an increase of $134.3 million over the requested amount. Funding for advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions of coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The act does not include a provision from the House regarding the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Department of Energy funding was appropriated under a continuing resolution in the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. Approximately $1.8 billion was allocated to DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel. The Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, must inform congressional defense committees 30 days prior to any obligation or expenditure of these funds."
