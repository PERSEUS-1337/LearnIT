It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include educational benefits for dependents of civilian federal law enforcement officers killed or disabled in the line of duty. The subpart aims to enhance the appeal of service in civilian Federal law enforcement agencies, provide educational benefits to qualified dependents of officers who may not afford it due to death or disability, and help family members achieve the educational status they would have if not for the loss or disability of a parent or spouse. SEC. 1212 outlines the eligibility criteria and benefits for dependents of eligible Federal law enforcement officers, including financial assistance for education programs. The duration of benefits is limited to forty-five months of full-time education, with an age limit of 27 for dependent children. The Attorney General requires an application for assistance under this subpart, which will be approved unless the dependent is ineligible, their chosen educational institution does not meet requirements, their program does not meet criteria, or they are already qualified. The Attorney General will notify the dependent of approval or disapproval.
