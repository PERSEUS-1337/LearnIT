    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders. This allows for an initial 3-year admission period, with the possibility of extension for an additional 3 years. Employers hiring H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from showing that the positions are seasonal or temporary. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders. Eligible aliens with H-2A worker status for at least 33 months can seek immigrant visas without labor certification. Petitions can be filed by the employer or the alien. No labor certification is required for eligible aliens seeking immigrant visas under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii). Filing a petition or adjustment of status based on the petition will not affect other H-2A worker-related requests or modifications. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Nothing in this paragraph may prevent an eligible alien from seeking adjustment of status in accordance with any other provision of law."
