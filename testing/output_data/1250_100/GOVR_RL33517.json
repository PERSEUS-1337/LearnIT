    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose rescinding funding in an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve within 45 days, the funding must be made available for agencies to use. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 was introduced to require at least one house to vote on presidential rescission proposals. Under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, \"enhanced rescission\" altered the framework to favor the President, allowing spending reductions to remain permanently cancelled unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate consideration of the President's rescission request. Congressional approval is still necessary, but fast-track procedures encourage a prompt up-or-down vote on the proposal. The expedited rescission approach allows for a quick up-or-down vote on the President's proposal, transferring less power from Congress to the President. In the 102nd and 103rd Congress, bills were passed to expedite the process, with provisions for special rescission messages and no limit on the amount that could be rescinded. The expedited rescission measures in H.R. 1578 and H.R. 4600 detailed fast-track procedures for consideration of a rescission's substitute, allowing submission of special rescission messages and proposing the repeal of targeted tax benefits within a specified timeframe. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 proposed granting the President the authority to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or repeal of targeted tax benefits through special messages to Congress. The bill allowed flexibility in the submission and packaging of these messages, with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple rescissions in a single message. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 proposed granting the President the authority to propose rescission of budget authority, direct spending items, or repeal of targeted tax benefits through special messages to Congress. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures, with a specific timeline for introduction, committee review, and final passage. The bill also outlined the process for adjusting committee allocations and spending caps after the enactment of a rescission approval bill. The LLIVA introduced in 2006 would allow the President to withhold budget authority for up to 180 days and suspend direct spending for the same period. This provision is unique in expedited rescission bills and aims to give Congress time to consider the President's requests. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism argue that it could lead to policy deferrals similar to those invalidated in previous court decisions. Supporters emphasize that the 180-day period is the maximum time for funding deferral, with the option for the President to release funds earlier if needed. The bill language allows the President to release funds earlier if deemed necessary, without requiring early release even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The LLIVA states its provisions are severable for judicial review, meaning unconstitutional portions would not affect the rest. The act applies only to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including an omnibus budget reform measure with provisions for expedited rescission. The President can propose rescinding wasteful budget authority in appropriations acts and reduce discretionary spending limits. H.R. 2290 limits the President to one message per appropriations act, unless multiple subcommittees are involved. Representative Mark Udall introduced the SLICE Act in 2006 to require Congress to debate and vote on presidential proposals for expenditure cuts. The provisions in H.R.4699 would require Congress to debate and vote on presidential proposals for reducing spending. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, allowing the President to propose cancellations of discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The President could propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions through a special message and draft bill. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667, which includes a legislative line item veto allowing for expedited congressional consideration of the President's proposals. H.R.5667, introduced by Representative John Spratt, includes a legislative line item veto for expedited congressional consideration of the President's proposals. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee approved the bill, which was later passed by the House. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act in the Senate, containing a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Senate Budget Committee marked up S. 3521 and voted 12-10 to report the bill favorably. A comparative overview of major features in expedited rescission bills was provided, showing differences among versions. Changes were made to lessen the President's flexibility, such as setting a deadline for submission of special messages within 45 days of enactment. The Senate Budget Committee marked up S. 3521, allowing special messages up to one year after enactment. The House version permits more special messages but limits withholding funds to 90 days. The House version includes a sunset termination date, while the Senate bill does not. The rescission authority in S. 3521 would expire after four years, narrowing the range of possible targeted tax benefits compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 applies to revenue-losing provisions affecting a single beneficiary, while S. 3521 defines targeted tax benefits as affecting a particular or limited group of taxpayers. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 allows the President to propose targeted tax benefits and repeals parts of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The bills aim to amend the ICA by removing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and replacing it with new text for expedited rescissions. There were no further changes to H.R. 4890 during floor consideration. The manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan clarified that any cancelled funds from a trust or special fund would be returned to the original fund. Changes in H.R. 4890 were made during committee markups, while S. 3521 includes provisions on resubmitting rejected items and reducing the President's power to suspend spending. The provisions for expedited consideration of special messages from the President proposing rescissions of funds have remained similar over the years, with expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seeking a vote on final passage within 10 days. Earlier bills allowed for consideration of substitute packages or motions to strike specific rescissions, but current bills do not contain such provisions. Expedited rescission bills have varied in scope over the years, with some focusing on discretionary budget rescissions. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4699 expanded the scope of expedited rescission bills to include certain transportation projects. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, with its broad rescission powers, raised concerns about possible constitutional issues and included provisions for quick judicial review. However, the expedited rescission approach, especially for discretionary spending, is generally seen as constitutionally sound. The LLIVA includes a severability provision to protect the act in case of any unconstitutional findings. The Line Item Veto Act of 2006 allows the President to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration, targeting discretionary budget authority or direct spending. The Bush Administration sought enactment of the LLIVA in the 109th Congress, with the President urging the Senate to pass the line item veto to enhance fiscal discipline."
