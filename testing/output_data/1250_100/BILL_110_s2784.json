    "content": "The Howard M. Metzenbaum ``Menu Education and Labeling Act'' or the ``MEAL Act'' is the short title of this legislation. The Act includes findings related to menu labeling. Congress finds that there is a strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the alarming increase in obesity in the United States. Obesity is linked to diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other health problems, costing $117 billion annually. Additionally, there has been a significant rise in meals prepared or eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and almost half of total food dollars spent on restaurant and food-service establishments. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, leading cause of death in the US. Heart disease also leads to disability among working adults and has a significant economic impact. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. Approximately 75 percent of adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets. Consumers find it challenging to limit calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information availability. Studies suggest that consumers want nutrition information when ordering food at restaurants to make informed decisions. Surgeon General and Secretary of Health recommend increased availability of nutrition information to reduce obesity rates. SEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF STANDARD MENU ITEMS AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS. Section 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to disclose certain information about their food items. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must disclose calorie, fat, and sodium content of standard food servings on menus or signs, as well as provide information to help the public understand the nutritional significance in the context of a daily diet. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations are required to provide calorie, fat, and sodium content of standard food servings on menus or signs. Additionally, they must offer information to help the public understand the nutritional significance in the context of a daily diet. Nonapplicability clauses exclude certain items not listed on menus or menu boards, and self-service facilities must display calorie information per standard serving. The regulations allow for voluntary provision of nutrition information by retail food establishments, and state or local requirements can mandate additional nutrition information. The Secretary is required to propose regulations within one year of enactment to carry out these provisions. The regulations must accommodate variations in serving sizes and food preparation due to human error and training. The Secretary must finalize regulations within 2 years of enactment, or proposed regulations will become effective. The final regulations require vending machine operators with 20 or more machines to display calorie information on a sign near the food. Operators can also provide additional nutrition information voluntarily. The final regulations require vending machine operators with 20 or more machines to display calorie information on a sign near the food. Operators can voluntarily provide additional nutrition information, complying with nutrition labeling requirements. States can also impose additional nutrition information requirements. The Secretary must propose regulations within one year and finalize them within two years of enactment. If the Secretary does not finalize regulations within 2 years, proposed regulations become effective as final regulations the day after that date, and the Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register."
