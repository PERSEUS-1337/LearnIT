    "content": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has faced conflict and state collapse since 2013, with the rebel movement Seleka seizing control. Anti-balaka militias formed in response, leading to widespread violence. Despite a decrease in violence since 2013-2014, periodic flare-ups continue to disrupt social cohesion and government stability. CAR has a history of weak central governance and recurrent insurgencies. In 2016, Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra was elected president, marking the country's second democratic transfer of power since independence from France in 1960. The political transition period in the Central African Republic ended with the convening of a new National Assembly in May 2016. Donors are supporting the new government while addressing policy concerns and global demands for resources. International forces, including MINUSCA and Operation Sangaris, have been deployed since 2013 to stabilize the country. France is expected to maintain a rapid-reaction force and security cooperation program. President Touad\u00e9ra has been slow to advance initiatives for stability in CAR. State institutions are absent in much of the country. The minority Muslim community has fled to neighboring countries. The Seleka movement has split into factions, targeting civilians and engaging in racketeering. The Lord's Resistance Army is active in the east. Domestic opposition to MINUSCA has grown due to capacity issues and scandals of abuse by foreign troops. The Central African Republic (CAR) is facing a dire humanitarian situation with a large number of refugees and internally displaced persons. Economic activity has slightly improved since 2015, but real GDP remains below pre-conflict levels. The country was already one of the world's poorest before the conflict. International policymakers are considering transitioning from emergency humanitarian assistance to development aid, funding for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants, and determining eligibility for integration of fighters. The Central African Republic (CAR) is grappling with humanitarian challenges, including the integration of former combatants and the lifting of a U.N. arms embargo. Questions arise about international troop presence, U.S. military advisors' role, targeted sanctions, and potential adjustments to MINUSCA's mandate. The Central African Republic (CAR) is facing humanitarian challenges, including integrating former combatants and lifting a U.N. arms embargo. Questions arise about adjusting MINUSCA's mandate, improving effectiveness, preventing sexual abuse, supporting the Touad\u00e9ra administration, responding to ex-Seleka leaders' reunification efforts, encouraging displaced populations' return, building up civilian security forces, and supporting reconciliation and accountability measures. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) involves tensions over resources, trade control, and national identity. The Seleka rebellion, founded in 2012, primarily operates in the northeastern region with ties to Chad and Sudan. The movement stemmed from grievances among Muslims and northeasterners regarding political exclusion and poor governance. Anti-balaka groups, led by Christians and animists, emerged in response to Seleka's actions in 2013. The conflict in the Central African Republic involves tensions over resources, trade control, and national identity. Anti-balaka groups, led by Christians and animists, organized in response to the Seleka takeover in late 2013. The politicization of religious identity under former President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 has fueled nativist anger and brutal collective punishment based on sectarian identity. Seleka commanders oversaw attacks on Christian communities, including massacres in the northwest region. By mid-2014, anti-balaka groups gained control in the south and west of the Central African Republic, targeting Muslim communities with assaults, looting, and forced conversions. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims fled, their properties were seized, mosques destroyed, and religious practices suppressed. A U.N. commission labeled the actions as \"ethnic cleansing.\" While sectarian killings have decreased since 2014, sporadic violence continues, sometimes orchestrated by militia leaders with political ties. In September 2015, violence erupted in Bangui following the murder of a Muslim man, leading to an attempted overthrow of the transitional government by ex-Seleka and anti-balaka hardliners. The national military, dominated by Christians and distrusted by Muslims, reportedly participated in the abuses. Clashes among ex-Seleka factions have increased since 2014, revealing divergent interests and ethnic identities within the movement. The violence in CAR is rooted in a history of coopting rebel leaders into government positions, fueling rebellion and contributing to a perception of impunity. The recent conflict in CAR is linked to systems of patronage and nepotism, with violence blurring the lines between combatants and civilians. Ethno-religious identities have been hardened, leading to armed communities divided along religious lines. Anti-Muslim sentiment remains strong among Christians, with acts of aggression targeting Muslim displaced persons. The conflict has reopened questions about who has the right to live in CAR. President Touad\u00e9ra assumed office in March 2016 after winning the election with over 60% of the vote. He was praised for his relatively peaceful and transparent election, with high voter turnout. Touad\u00e9ra, a former Prime Minister and math professor, was not initially seen as a front-runner for the presidency. His victory was attributed to his low profile and lack of strong opposition. Touad\u00e9ra is the first president to come to power through a democratic transfer since 1993, positioning him well to garner international and domestic support. President Touad\u00e9ra, who assumed office in 2016, has received praise for his peaceful election and broad political coalition. His predecessor, Catherine Samba-Panza, faced allegations of corruption and nepotism. Touad\u00e9ra's competition with Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 involved supporters of the former president, who was barred from running for reelection. Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 conceded the election amidst allegations of fraud and now leads the opposition bloc in parliament. President Touad\u00e9ra, elected in 2016, leads the opposition bloc in parliament. His ties to former President Boziz\u00e9 have raised concerns, with several Boziz\u00e9 allies in his cabinet. Observers warn of tensions due to under-representation of Muslims in government. Key issues include disarmament, reconciliation, military reform, and job creation. Touad\u00e9ra must address poor governance, impunity, and corruption to retain popular support. His approach to these challenges remains uncertain. The challenges in the Central African Republic remain uncertain despite ongoing talks with armed group leaders. The Bangui Forum in May 2015 produced frameworks on disarmament, reforms, and reconciliation, but the status of these commitments is now uncertain. Spoilers pose a threat as the national government is mainly in the capital, while armed factions are active in various parts of the country. Anti-balaka leaders criticize President Touad\u00e9ra, and some ex-Seleka leaders are trying to reconstitute the movement. Some armed factions reject negotiations, and a fractious parliament may impede progress. Experts question the new government's ability to address these challenges. The new government in the Central African Republic faces challenges in achieving progress on stabilization. A constitutional referendum in 2015 led to the adoption of a new constitution aimed at increasing checks on presidential power and improving oversight of natural resource deals. The UN Security Council authorized the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA) in 2014, increasing its troop ceiling in subsequent resolutions. Experts question the government's political will and capacity to address these challenges. MINUSCA, with 12,870 personnel including military and police, had its mandate extended to November 2017. Despite reaching authorized strength levels, logistical challenges hinder effective deployment in remote areas. The mission has declared \"weapons-free zones\" in conflict-affected areas, but armed actors still enter unobstructed. The killing of a Muslim man in Kaga-Bandoro in October 2016 triggered violence by armed groups in CAR, resulting in nearly 40 deaths and displacing thousands. Force protection remains a challenge, with twelve MINUSCA peacekeepers killed in malicious acts. Continued violence has led to local frustrations with MINUSCA's perceived ineffectiveness, fueled by demagogic rhetoric. Anti-U.N. protests in Bangui turned violent in late October 2016, resulting in clashes and casualties. French, AU, and U.N. troops have been accused of sexual abuse and exploitation in CAR, including cases involving children. The UN has faced criticism for its response to allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation in CAR, with 63 allegations against MINUSCA personnel, including French forces, since the mission's inception. Some claims may have been fabricated, but the high number of abuses has been attributed to inadequate training and the harsh context in which troops operate. In mid-2015, evidence of abuses by French forces in CAR was ignored by U.N. officials for months, leading to criticism of the U.N.'s handling of allegations. An independent review in December 2015 accused U.N. agencies and MINUSCA of being aware of the allegations but failing to follow up appropriately, resulting in a \"gross institutional failure.\" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon fired the head of MINUSCA in response to these scandals. His successor, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, has vowed to address abuses by providing resources for reporting misbehavior, strengthening investigative officers, and protecting whistleblowers. The Central African Republic (CAR) is one of the world's least developed countries with agriculture, forestry, and mining as key economic sectors in disarray. Population displacements have led to food insecurity, exacerbated by the exodus of persecuted Muslim communities. Illicit economic networks thrive, with armed groups profiting from taxation and illicit trade in gold and diamonds. CAR is described as a \"warlord\" economy due to widespread violence and revenue collection through threats and attacks on civilians and businesses. Armed groups in CAR profit from looting, poaching ivory, and controlling mining sites. The country was suspended from exporting diamonds in 2013 due to conflict diamond concerns. Over $24 million worth of diamonds were smuggled out between 2013 and 2014. The Kimberley Process established a framework in 2015 for resuming diamond exports from compliant zones. In March 2016, Kimberley Process monitors certified Berb\u00e9rati as compliant for diamond exports, with three more sub-prefectures declared compliant in September 2016. Efforts are ongoing to certify additional zones, particularly in the country's southwest. However, concerns have been raised about premature certification in areas with active armed groups. The IMF approved a financial assistance package in 2016 to promote macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth, with structural reforms focused on revenue generation progressing as planned. The IMF lowered its GDP growth projections for CAR to 4.5% and 5.0% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, due to deteriorating security conditions. The World Bank has provided nearly $100 million in grants and loans since 2013 to restore government services. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has been operating in CAR since 2008, expanding its influence into northeastern Haute-Kotto prefecture. The LRA has been operating in CAR since 2008, displacing hundreds of thousands of people in CAR, DRC, and South Sudan. The group exploits CAR's porous borders to smuggle ivory poached from DRC to Sudan for trafficking to Asia. The Ugandan military, supported by the US, has conducted counter-LRA operations in CAR since 2009. Uganda began pulling back its troops from CAR in 2016. The LRA has been operating in CAR since 2008, displacing hundreds of thousands of people in CAR, DRC, and South Sudan. Uganda began pulling back its troops from CAR in 2016. The group's leadership structure has shown signs of weakening, with top commanders surrendering or being confirmed dead. Dominic Ongwen surrendered to U.S. forces in CAR and faces charges at the International Criminal Court. LRA fighters have exploited instability in CAR to engage in illicit trafficking of gold and diamonds. The LRA's leadership structure has weakened in recent years, with only Joseph Kony remaining at large. Estimates show the group has fewer than 200 fighters. Despite limited U.S. engagement in CAR historically, there has been a recent increase in diplomatic operations, including the appointment of a new U.S. Ambassador in 2015. The Obama Administration scaled up U.S. involvement in response to the crisis in 2013. In 2013, the Obama Administration increased U.S. aid and diplomatic efforts to address the crisis in CAR. Executive Order 13667 authorized targeted sanctions, support was provided to peacekeepers and French troops, and funding was allocated for conflict mitigation and reconciliation programs. The Administration emphasized the prevention of \"mass atrocities\" as a key foreign policy goal. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power stressed the importance of timely response to mass violence during a visit to Bangui in 2014. The Administration has imposed targeted financial and travel sanctions on individuals, companies, and armed groups contributing to the conflict in CAR, including former presidents, militia leaders, the Lord's Resistance Army, and diamond companies. Not all U.S. designees are on the U.N. sanctions list, and few have assets or travel to the United States. The U.S. has been the leading humanitarian donor to CAR since 2013, providing over $404 million in aid. The United States has been the top financial contributor to MINUSCA's budget since 2013, providing over $404 million in aid to CAR and CAR refugees. U.S. funding for MINUSCA comes from the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities account. In FY2017, the State Department requested $18.1 million in bilateral aid for CAR, including funds for peacekeeping operations, security sector reform, criminal justice system establishment, peacebuilding programs, and military professionalization. The Administration pledged $11.7 million in U.S. funding at a donors' conference for CAR in Brussels in November 2016, with total donor pledges reaching $2.2 billion. USAID and the State Department allocated roughly $27 million for development and peacebuilding programs in CAR between FY2013 and FY2016. The State Department-administered INCLE account has been a top source of U.S. aid funding for CAR since 2014, with at least $25 million notified to Congress in FY2015. President Obama waived legal restrictions on certain aid to the government of CAR under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, allowing for the provision of otherwise-restricted programs to promote the purposes of the Act or the national interest of the United States. The 114th Congress shaped U.S. engagement with CAR through legislative provisions, including funding for reconciliation, peacebuilding programs, and assistance for civilians affected by the LRA. Similar provisions were included in the House version of the FY2017 foreign aid appropriations bill. The 114th Congress shaped U.S. engagement with CAR through legislative provisions, including funding for reconciliation, peacebuilding programs, and assistance for civilians affected by the LRA. Other relevant legislation enacted in the 114th Congress included the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016. Resolutions introduced in the 114th Congress with potential implications for CAR included those regarding genocide, mass atrocities, the Lord's Resistance Army, and World Refugee Day. In the 113th Congress, Senate appropriators expressed concern about violence in CAR potentially leading to genocide. The 114th Congress shaped U.S. engagement with CAR through legislative provisions, including funding for reconciliation, peacebuilding programs, and assistance for civilians affected by the conflict. The State Department submitted a strategy document defining U.S. national interests in CAR as preventing mass atrocities and helping the country become a stable regional partner. Despite international efforts, residents of CAR continue to suffer armed attacks by militias, with few root causes of the conflict addressed. Congress may influence funding levels and mechanisms of U.S. humanitarian assistance and support in CAR. The funding levels, duration, and mechanisms of U.S. humanitarian assistance and support for stabilization efforts in CAR are influenced by Congress. Observers debate the effectiveness of African Union versus U.N.-conducted stabilization missions in the region. International interventions have been attempted repeatedly, but achieving stability and improved governance in CAR remains challenging. Despite various international interventions in CAR, including military interventions, peace processes, and security sector reform efforts, progress in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants, as well as the prosecution of human rights abusers, has been limited. The conflict has led to harmful dynamics at the grassroots level, impacting regional stability concerns for U.S. policymakers. CAR refugees have strained local resources, hindered cross-border trade, and affected humanitarian aid delivery. Insecurity hinders cross-border trade and aid delivery in CAR. Neighboring states lack capacity to respond to problems or contain violence. Regional crises could affect stabilization efforts in CAR. Concerns arise over potential withdrawal of Burundian troops from MINUSCA due to abuses. There are worries about extremist organizations finding safe havens in CAR."
