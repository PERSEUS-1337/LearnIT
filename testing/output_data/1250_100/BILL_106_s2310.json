    "content": "The \"Firearms Dealer Penalty Flexibility Act of 2000\" allows for the suspension of a firearms dealer's license and imposes civil penalties. Section 923 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to allow the Secretary to suspend or revoke a license or impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for willful violations of firearm regulations. This includes transferring armor-piercing ammunition and the ability to compromise, mitigate, or remit liability for violations. The Secretary has the authority to suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for willful violations of firearm regulations. The affected party must be provided with written notice stating the grounds for denial, revocation, suspension, or assessment of a civil penalty. The holder of a license must receive notice before the effective date of revocation or suspension. Appeals can be made through a hearing process. If the Secretary denies, revokes, or suspends a license, or assesses a civil penalty, a hearing can be requested for review. The Secretary's decision can be appealed within a 60-day period after a hearing is held. The aggrieved party can file a petition with the district court for a de novo judicial review of the denial, revocation, suspension, or assessment. The court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties, regardless of whether it was presented at the initial hearing. If the court determines that the Secretary was not authorized, a decision can be overturned. If the Secretary is not authorized to deny, revoke, suspend, or assess, the court will order necessary actions to comply. The Secretary must stay the action pending an appeal if a license is suspended, revoked, or a penalty assessed. SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF FIREARMS DEALER'S LICENSE UPON FELONY CONVICTION. Amends Section 925(b) of title 18, United States Code to change the wording regarding the termination of a firearms dealer's license upon felony conviction."
