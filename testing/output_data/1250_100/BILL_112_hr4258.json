Georgia has been a reliable ally in global peace efforts and the US-Georgia Charter emphasizes the importance of their partnership in democracy, defense, trade, and cultural exchanges. Georgia's democratic nature strengthens the friendship between the two countries. Democracy in Georgia is facing challenges with political freedom and fair competition under assault. The government has detained political opposition members, limited press freedom, and hindered workers' rights. The 2010 Human Rights Report on Georgia highlighted significant problems during President Mikheil Saakashvili's re-election in 2008. The 2010 Human Rights Report on Georgia highlighted significant problems during President Mikheil Saakashvili's re-election in 2008, including allegations of intimidation, flawed vote-counting processes, and shortcomings in the complaints and appeals process. International observers found the parliamentary elections in May 2008 to be uneven and incomplete in adhering to international standards. United Nations Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai noted a widespread climate of fear, intimidation, and arbitrary restrictions of fundamental freedoms in Georgia, with concerns about the government undermining political parties and NGOs. Georgia is facing concerns about the blurred line between the ruling party and the state ahead of the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. President Saakashvili enacted constitutional changes to reduce his power and increase the prime minister's authority. Bidzina Ivanishvili launched the Georgian Dream party to unite opposition parties. Since the launch of Georgian Dream, Saakashvili's regime has aggressively targeted and undermined the opposition party, including stripping Ivanishvili of his citizenship and harassing supporters through violent means without due process. Several incidents of human rights violations and political repression have occurred in Georgia, including the detention of opposition supporters, suspicious deaths in police custody, and violent crackdowns on protests. The Georgian Parliament also passed controversial election laws limiting opposition parties' access to funds, criticized by international organizations and the U.S. State Department. The Chamber of Control, controlled by Saakashvili, established a new division to investigate Georgian Dream and Ivanishvili, hindering financial support for opposition. The United Nations Special Rapporteur criticized changes to election laws affecting rights to association and peaceful assembly. The Saakashvili regime manipulated the Georgian banking sector to target Bank Cartu owned by Ivanishvili, violating international human rights law. The Georgian Government seized millions of dollars in bank assets, with the American Chamber of Commerce criticizing the new law. This law allows the Government to seize loan collateral before banks, targeting Bank Cartu owned by Ivanishvili. The United States emphasizes the importance of a democratic Georgia for national security interests. The United States warns President Saakashvili that if he does not allow fair elections, the special relationship with Georgia will be at risk, leading to a loss of political support and financial assistance. No funds for fiscal year 2013 can be used to assist Georgia until the Secretary of State certifies that the 2012 parliamentary elections were free, fair, and competitive. The report must include details on election observers, opposition parties' campaigning ability, and whether Bidzina Ivanishvili and the Georgian Dream Party participated."
