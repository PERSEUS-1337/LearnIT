    "content": "Existing attention mechanisms focus on individual items in a collection, but area attention proposes attending to a group of items in an area of memory. The size of the area is dynamically determined through learning, allowing for varying levels of granularity. Area attention can be used in conjunction with multi-head attention to attend to multiple areas in memory. It has been evaluated in tasks such as neural machine translation and image captioning, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Area attention is a novel concept that improves accuracy in deep learning tasks by allowing models to selectively focus on specific information. It involves a memory-query paradigm and can be efficiently computed using summed area tables. This attention mechanism has shown improvements in tasks like neural machine translation and image captioning. Area attention is a novel concept in deep learning that improves accuracy by allowing models to focus on specific information using a memory-query paradigm. Attention mechanisms, such as key-value pairs and weighted probabilities, help the model attend to specific pieces of information during training. The granularity of attention is predetermined based on the type of model, such as character-level or word-level translation models. In this paper, the concept of area attention is proposed as a mechanism for models to focus on structurally adjacent groups of items in memory. Area attention allows for varying levels of granularity in attention calculation, with each unit representing an area that can contain multiple items. It subsumes item-based attention and can be used in multi-head attention models, leading to improved results in machine translation tasks. The models discussed in the current text chunk involve various architectures for tasks like machine translation and image captioning. They utilize LSTM seq2seq with attention and encoder-decoder Transformer. Recent works have explored representing sentence segments by subtracting the encoding of the first token from the last token. Area attention is defined as the mean of vectors in a segment, without needing to carry contextual dependency. The current text chunk discusses a new approach called area attention that calculates the mean of vectors in a segment without requiring contextual dependency. This method differs from previous works that focus on capturing structures in attention calculation and representing sentence segments through subtraction of token encodings. The proposed area attention does not rely on contextual or dependency information for each item, unlike other approaches. The text discusses the area attention approach, which allows a model to attend to information at varying granularity without the need for special networks or additional loss functions. This method enhances Transformer architecture and has shown state-of-the-art results on various tasks. The text introduces the concept of area memory in 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional structures for language and image-related tasks. It explains how adjacent items are combined to form areas, with a maximum size limit set for each task. The approach enhances Transformer architecture for better performance on various tasks. In this example, the original memory is a 3x3 grid of items with maximum height and width allowed for each area as 2. Multiple areas can be generated by combining adjacent items. For the 1-dimensional case, the number of areas is calculated using a formula. In the 2-dimensional case, a quadratic number of areas can be generated. To attend to each area, keys and values are defined for each area containing one or multiple items in the original memory. The key of an area is defined as the mean vector of the key of each item in the area. In the context of attending to different areas within a grid of items, the dimension allowed for an area is 2x2. The value of an area is defined as the sum of all value vectors within it. Area attention can be calculated using standard methods without introducing additional parameters. Alternatively, richer representations of each area can be derived by considering features like standard deviation, height, and width. These features are combined using a multi-layer perceptron and embedding matrices. In the context of attending to different areas within a grid of items, the dimension allowed for an area is 2x2. The value of an area is the sum of all value vectors within it. To optimize computation, a summed area table technique is used based on a pre-computed integral image. This allows for constant time calculation of features in each rectangular area, reducing time complexity to O(|M |A). The integral image allows for quick computation of key and value for each area in constant time. By utilizing the summed area table technique, the sum of vectors in each area can be easily calculated. This method optimizes computation by reducing time complexity to O(|M|A). We experimented with area attention on neural machine translation and image captioning tasks, using popular encoder and decoder choices like LSTM and Transformer. Transformer has shown state-of-the-art performance on English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, while LSTM with encoder-decoder attention is commonly used for neural machine translation. The datasets used contain millions of sentence pairs for each language. Transformer heavily relies on attention mechanisms for its operations. The Transformer model heavily utilizes attention mechanisms, including self-attention and attention from the decoder to the encoder. Different configurations of Transformer were investigated, ranging from Tiny to Big variations with varying hidden layers, sizes, filter sizes, and attention heads. Training batches consisted of approximately 32,000 tokens for all models except Big, which used 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs for training. Training steps for the Transformer Base model took 0.4 seconds for Regular Attention, 0.5 seconds for basic Area Attention, and 0.8 seconds for Area Attention. For Big, a smaller batch size of 16,000 tokens was used due to memory constraints, trained for 600,000 steps. Training times were 0.5 seconds for Regular Attention, 0.6 seconds for basic Area Attention, and 1.0 seconds for Area Attention with multiple features. Area attention was applied to each Transformer variation, improving performance consistently. Transformer Big with regular attention did not match reported performance due to different batch size and training steps, but area attention still outperformed the baseline. Area attention with Transformer Big achieved BLEU 29.68 on EN-DE, surpassing the state-of-art result of 28.4. A 2-layer LSTM was used for both encoder and decoder, with multiplicative attention for encoder-decoder alignment. Different LSTM configurations were tested to observe the impact of area attention on translation tasks. LSTM trains slower than Transformer due to sequential computation, so data parallelism was increased by using larger batch sizes. LSTM models were trained on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, with varying numbers of LSTM cells trained for 50,000 steps. In experiments with Transformer and LSTM architectures for character-level translation, area attention consistently improved model performance. Transformer showed improvement across all configurations with area attention, while LSTM models required smaller batch sizes due to memory constraints. The ability to combine adjacent characters with area attention likely enhances regular attention mechanisms. We achieved significant improvements in Transformer models with area attention for English-to-German and English-to-French character-level translation tasks, with BLEU scores of 26.65 and 34.81 respectively. Area attention outperformed baselines in most conditions, especially in smaller models. Image captioning tasks involve using deep architectures with image encoders like ResNet and language decoders like LSTM or Transformer. In this experiment, a champion condition from BID13 was followed, using a pre-trained Inception-ResNet for image embeddings, a 6-layer Transformer for image encoding and decoding. The study investigates how area attention improves captioning accuracy, focusing on self-attention and encoder-decoder attention. Training was done on COCO dataset with 82K images for training and 40K for validation. The study used dataset BID9 with 82K training images and 40K validation images, each with 5 groundtruth captions. Training was done on a distributed learning infrastructure with 10 GPU cores. Models were tested on COCO40 and Flickr 1K test sets, reporting CIDEr and ROUGE-L metrics. Different variations of area attention were experimented with in the image encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder attention. The study experimented with different variations of area attention in the image encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder attention. Models with area attention outperformed the benchmark on CIDEr and ROUGE-L metrics. The models with 3 \u00d7 3 area attention achieved the best results overall, while the 2 \u00d7 2 and 3 \u00d7 3 parameter-free models also performed well. The novel attentional mechanism allows the model to attend to areas as a whole, with the size of an area varying based on the learned coherence of adjacent items. Area attention, a novel attentional mechanism, allows the model to attend to information at varying granularity. It contrasts with item-based attention mechanisms and has shown state-of-the-art results in tasks like neural machine translation and image captioning."
