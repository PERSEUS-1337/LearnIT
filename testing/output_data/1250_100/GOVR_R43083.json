Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to their potential to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. The SBA's mission is to aid, counsel, assist, and protect small-business concerns to preserve free competitive enterprise. The Small Business Administration (SBA) aims to support small businesses by ensuring a fair share of government contracts and sales go to them, promoting job creation and retention. The SBA gathers data on jobs created or retained by their assistance and sponsors research on small businesses' role in job creation. Economists debate the justification of federal assistance for small businesses based on job creation. Economic research suggests that federal assistance to small business startups can lead to short-term job creation. Startups are seen as important for job creation, but their long-term impact on net job creation is limited as many startups do not survive beyond five years. Research indicates that startups with 20-499 employees have a positive impact on job creation, while startups with fewer than 20 employees have a negligible effect. Providing SBA assistance, such as guaranteed loans or venture capital, to startups is considered a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, with advocates focusing on job creation and opponents highlighting the risk of default. The SBIC Participating Securities program, established in 1994, aimed to fill an investment gap for equity investments in startup and early-stage small businesses. The SBA created a program to address an investment gap left by the SBIC debenture program, which focused on mid- and later-stage small businesses. Following significant losses, the SBA ceased new commitments for participation securities in 2004, leading to the program's eventual discontinuation. This report examines startups' experiences with SBA's management and technical assistance programs, including SBDCs, WBCs, SCORE, and various lending programs. It also discusses the SBA's growth accelerators initiative and the now-ended SBIC early stage debenture program focused on providing venture capital to startups. The SBA's programs provide assistance to startups and small businesses at all stages, with a focus on venture capital. These programs report outcome and performance data based on the age of the business, allowing for comparisons between startups and older firms. Programs targeting startups provide a larger share of assistance compared to others. Data on economic impact and job creation are limited and face methodological challenges. The SBA has been providing management and technical assistance training to small businesses since 1953. They have increasingly relied on third parties to deliver this training, with over 1.5 million entrepreneurs benefiting each year. The SBA believes this support contributes to the long-term success and growth of small businesses. The SBA provides financial support to various resource partners, including SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE. These programs offer training assistance to small businesses at all stages of development, with SBDC clients typically being larger in terms of revenue and employment. WBCs' clients are more likely to be female. SBDCs are hosted by universities and state agencies to provide assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs. The Small Business Administration provides training assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs through SBDCs and WBCs. SBDCs offer services on a nonfee basis through lead service centers across the US and territories, assisting over 245,000 clients in FY2017. WBCs focus on women-owned businesses, providing services to over 114,000 clients in the same year. SCORE, a national volunteer organization, provided technical assistance training services to 519,368 clients and counseling services to 126,892 clients in FY2017. They also assisted in the formation of 54,027 new businesses. The SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development conducts an annual study to assess the impact of programs on small businesses, including staffing decisions and management practices. The SBA's 2012 survey included responses from clients in SBDC, WBC, and SCORE programs. The survey data showed that the programs assisted small businesses at all stages, with most clients finding the assistance useful and resulting in changes to their management practices. However, few reported hiring new staff, retaining staff, or increasing profit margins as a result of the assistance. The survey data indicated that clients receiving more counseling hours, female clients, startups, and clients with larger businesses were more likely to report positive financial impacts. SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE served businesses at different stages, with most clients finding the information provided by counselors useful. The survey data showed that startup clients, including nascent and startup clients, found the information provided during face-to-face management and technical assistance training to be useful. More than half of SBDC and SCORE startup clients reported changing their management practices as a result of the training, while three-quarters of WBC startup clients made changes. A small percentage of startup clients agreed with the statement regarding management and technical assistance. The survey data showed that startup clients found the management and technical assistance training useful. A small percentage of clients agreed that the training helped them retain current staff, hire new staff, and improve profit margins. Growth accelerators help entrepreneurs start and scale their businesses by providing access to seed capital. The SBA's growth accelerator initiative aims to assist small businesses, especially startups, in accessing seed capital, mentors, and networking opportunities. Regional events in 2012 brought together universities and accelerators to support high-growth entrepreneurs. The initiative received funding to provide matching grants for new or existing accelerator programs. The SBA's growth accelerator program received funding for five years but had to drop the 4:1 private-sector match requirement due to budget constraints. They announced 50 grants of $50,000 each in 2014 and received over 800 applications. Congress recommended funding for the program in subsequent years, with matching fund requirements. The SBA's growth accelerator program received funding for five years, with grants of $50,000 each in 2016 and 2017. Reports show over 1,000 small businesses graduated, creating or retaining nearly 4,800 jobs. The Trump Administration cut funding for the initiative in FY2018 and FY2019, despite the program's aim to provide loans to small businesses struggling to access capital. The SBA enhanced small business access to capital in FY2018 by approving $30.2 billion in loans through various programs, including the 7(a) loan guaranty program and the 504/CDC loan guaranty program. The Microloan program provided $76.8 million in loans to small businesses, including startups. The 7(a) loan guaranty program is the agency's flagship program. The SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program provides business loans to American small businesses with a guaranty of repayment in case of default. The program offers up to 85% guaranty for loans of $150,000 or less and up to 75% for loans exceeding $150,000, up to $5 million. Funds can be used for various business purposes such as acquiring land, improving sites, purchasing buildings, constructing new buildings, acquiring fixed assets, financing working capital, and refinancing debts. The SBA's 504/CDC loan guaranty program offers long-term fixed rate financing for major fixed assets like land, buildings, equipment, and machinery. The 504/CDC loan program provides long-term fixed rate financing for major fixed assets like land, buildings, equipment, and machinery. A third-party lender must provide at least 50% of the financing, the CDC provides up to 40% backed by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture, and the applicant provides at least 10% of the financing. The SBA's debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and is sold to investors. The accounting for the loan is set up at the Central Servicing Agent, not the SBA. The 504/CDC program, administered by the Central Servicing Agent (CSA), guarantees timely payment of the debenture by the SBA. Borrowers must meet job creation or retention requirements based on economic development objectives. If not met, eligibility can be retained by meeting community development or public policy goals. The SBA's Microloan program, authorized in 1991, aims to assist small businesses, particularly women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs, in gaining access to capital. It was made permanent in 1997 and focuses on job creation or retention criteria for project debentures. Loans to small manufacturers are excluded from the calculation. The Microloan program aims to assist small business concerns by providing loans up to $50,000 for working capital or acquiring materials, supplies, or equipment. Borrowers cannot owe more than $50,000 at a time and must repay the loan within six years. Loan terms vary based on size, fund use, lender requirements, and borrower needs. Interest rates are negotiated between the borrower and the lender. The SBA provides lending support to small businesses with interest rates typically ranging from 7% to 9%. Borrowers are required to provide collateral and a personal guarantee. The SBA does not review creditworthiness but maintains a database on loan approvals and impact on job creation. The Microloan program offers a higher share of lending to startups compared to other programs. The SBA's Microloan program provides a higher percentage of loan proceeds to startups compared to the 7(a) and 504/CDC programs. The SBA also has venture capital programs, including the SBIC program, aimed at stimulating the national economy and providing capital for small businesses. The SBA sponsors the New Markets Venture Capital Program to promote economic development in low-income areas. It partners with SBICs to provide financing to small businesses, with the SBA guaranteeing the debenture. There were 305 licensed SBICs participating in the program as of September 30, 2018. SBICs can apply for financial assistance of up to 300% of their private capital, but the SBA typically approves up to 200%. The SBA approves debenture SBICs for a maximum of 200% of their private capital. No fund management team may exceed the allowable maximum amount of leverage of $175 million per SBIC and $350 million for two or more licenses under common control. SBICs invest in various industries, geographic areas, and stages of investment, specializing in specific fields or investing more generally. They provide equity capital through purchasing equity securities, making loans, purchasing debt securities, and providing guarantees to small businesses. The SBIC program has invested $30.1 billion in small businesses, with $14.3 billion at risk. In FY2018, $5.50 billion was provided in financing for 1,151 small businesses, with an increasing share going to startups. The Obama Administration established the early stage debenture SBIC initiative to encourage investments in startups. The early stage debenture SBIC initiative was established to encourage investments in startups. It includes new regulatory provisions to reduce risk, such as requiring more regulatory capital and limiting leverage. The SBA announced its first annual call for venture capital fund managers on May 1, 2012. On May 1, 2012, the SBA announced its first annual call for venture capital fund managers to apply for an early stage debenture SBIC license. Six funds were invited to submit license applications after a thorough review process. As of September 30, 2016, 5 out of 63 investment funds had been granted an early stage SBIC license, raising $246.9 million in private capital and investing $160.7 million in 62 small businesses. In FY2016, early stage SBICs invested $66.2 million in 45 small businesses. The SBA proposed changes to the early stage SBIC initiative in 2016 to attract more fund managers, but under the Trump Administration, new applications were stopped in 2017. The proposed rule to encourage SBICs was withdrawn in 2018 due to lack of interest. The impact on SBA financing for startups is uncertain. The SBA has a tradition of providing assistance to all qualifying small businesses, including startups, without focusing solely on those most likely to contribute to job growth or wealth creation. This aligns with the SBA's mission to promote free markets and prevent monopoly formation. Recent initiatives have increased attention on assisting startups. The SBA's recent initiatives, such as the Growth Accelerators and early stage debenture SBIC initiative, focus on assisting startups to boost job creation during the economic recovery. These programs are seen as supplements to existing ones, with some viewing the high risk-high reward nature of targeting startups controversial. While participants find the programs useful, assessing the balance between financial risks and job growth potential remains challenging due to limited data and methodological challenges in measuring their impact."
