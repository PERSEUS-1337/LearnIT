    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, containing detailed budget information, policy proposals, and economic forecasts for FY2007 through FY2012. It also addresses long-term fiscal issues and historical budget data. The budget process for FY2008 began with the Administration submitting its budget to Congress. Congress adopted the FY2008 budget resolution in May 2007, and by August, all twelve regular appropriation bills had been passed by the House. The Senate passed some bills but failed to pass the remaining eight by the end of FY2007. In October, the Senate passed the defense and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills, and a continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until November 16. The Senate passed a resolution to fund the government until November 16, which was signed by the President. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill, which was vetoed, and the Defense bill, which provided $459 billion in budget authority and was signed. The President threatened to veto many appropriation bills due to funding levels or policy disagreements, complicating the process. A funding continuation was passed on December 14, followed by another on December 21. An omnibus appropriations bill was passed on December 19, incorporating 10 remaining regular appropriations bills. On December 26, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161), providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress varied due to different assumptions and techniques. CBO's first budget report for FY2008 estimated a baseline deficit of $98 billion. The CBO baseline projections for FY2008 estimated a deficit of $98 billion, down from the previous year. The projections also showed a surplus in FY2012 and FY2017, based on assumptions set by law. Key assumptions include constant discretionary spending, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of the AMT \"patch.\" These factors contribute to declining deficits and emerging surpluses over the 10-year forecast window. The CBO projects growing federal deficits beyond the 10-year forecast window due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The report includes estimated budgetary effects of various policies, such as making tax cuts permanent and freezing discretionary appropriations. In March 2007, CBO forecasted a FY2008 deficit of $226 billion, lower than the President's budget projection. By FY2012, the President's proposals were expected to result in a deficit of $31 billion. President Bush's FY2008 budget called for extending and making permanent most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, as well as other expiring tax provisions, resulting in reduced estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The President's proposals would also reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and by $309 billion over 10 years. The FY2008 budget proposed reducing mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years. The budget includes a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for Social Security. The Administration estimates its proposals would yield five-year savings of $59 billion and 10-year increases of $359 billion, mainly due to the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. The budget also includes proposals to eliminate, reduce, or reform about 141 programs affecting discretionary and mandatory spending. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed reducing mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years, including personal Social Security accounts. The budget also aimed to eliminate, reduce, or reform 141 programs affecting discretionary and mandatory spending, with estimated savings of $22 billion in FY2008. The Mid-Session Review showed a $19 billion increase in the FY2008 deficit estimate due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending. The CBO analysis of FY2008 appropriations showed $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, with additional emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate budget resolution specified legislation for budget allocations. The Senate Budget Committee reported the Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) with expenditures and revenues yielding a FY2008 deficit estimated at $249 billion. The resolution proposed higher discretionary spending levels than the President, extending tax cuts with offsets. The House Budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) was expected to yield a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion. The House and Senate budget resolutions, along with the President's proposal, aim for a balanced budget in FY2012. They all assume minimal or nonexistent funding for military operations post-FY2008, leading to lower outlays. There is an expectation that more middle-income taxpayers will be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax after FY2008, boosting estimated tax revenues. The President's budget projects little growth in discretionary spending over five years, while the House and Senate resolutions assume the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unless extended. The House and Senate budget resolutions, along with the President's proposal, aim for a balanced budget in FY2012. They assume the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unless extended, leading to a large jump in tax revenues after 2010. Budget projections are uncertain and depend on economic forecasts, accuracy, and statistical unbiasedness. Technical factors, changes in economic conditions, and policy changes can affect budget outcomes. Budget estimates and projections are influenced by changing economic conditions, such as growth rates, inflation, and spending policies. Factors like population demographics, future productivity growth, and business cycles also impact budget estimates. Small changes in GDP growth can lead to significant changes in budget projections. For example, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years and $273 billion over ten years, according to CBO estimates. Budget estimates and projections are influenced by changing economic conditions, such as growth rates, inflation, and spending policies. Factors like population demographics, future productivity growth, and business cycles also impact budget estimates. Small changes in GDP growth can lead to significant changes in budget projections, with a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth potentially increasing the deficit by $61 billion over five years and $273 billion over ten years. The President's FY2008 budget includes measures to assess the accuracy of previous forecasts, with OMB analyzing a quarter century of budget estimates and estimating standard deviations for deficit projections. The gap between upper and lower bounds for deficit projections at the end of a five-year period was over $1.1 trillion, highlighting the variability in budget forecasts over time. The Senate and House Budget Committees passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution, with both resolutions focusing on additional domestic spending and accommodating the Administration's war funding request. The CBO's analysis shows that long-term budget forecasts, like the Administration's $61 billion surplus estimate for FY2012, are highly imprecise. The House and Senate agreed on the FY2008 budget resolution, setting discretionary spending at $954 billion, exceeding the President's request. This led to the drafting of appropriations bills by the Appropriations Committees, with the House passing all 12 bills by the end of FY2007. The Senate had passed four bills by that time. In November and December of FY2007, Congress passed various appropriations bills, including the Labor-HHS-Education bill and the Defense bill. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill. Continuing resolutions were passed to fund government operations until December 19, when an omnibus appropriations bill was approved. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) that included 10 regular appropriations bills into the State-Foreign Operations bill. A continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) was also passed, funding government operations until the end of the year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) was signed on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Projections for future federal outlays were issued by both the Administration and CBO, with budget resolutions specifying future spending and revenue paths. The Administration's budget proposed increasing outlays from $2,902 billion in FY2008 to $3,246 billion in FY2012, focusing on defense and homeland security spending. The Administration's budget proposed increasing outlays from $2,902 billion in FY2008 to $3,246 billion in FY2012, focusing on defense and homeland security spending. The proposals aim to hold non-defense, non-homeland security discretionary spending to a 1% annual increase, slow the growth in some mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and increase total outlays by 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012. The budget also includes additional funding for security activities, particularly for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration's budget proposes an $8 billion increase for non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels. There is a $7 billion increase in net interest payments in FY2008 due to increased federal borrowing. Overall, there is a $118 billion increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008 due to various factors. The Administration aims to reduce outlays from 20.2% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.0% of GDP in FY2008, with projections showing a decrease to 18.3% of GDP by FY2012. Defense spending is projected to fall by 1.1% of GDP over five years, while mandatory programs increase their share of GDP. The Administration's budget proposes increasing non-security discretionary spending by $8 billion and reducing mandatory spending by $10 billion compared to baseline levels. There is a $7 billion increase in net interest payments in FY2008 due to increased federal borrowing. Defense spending is projected to increase by 6.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, incorporating a $140 billion supplemental for military actions overseas. Non-defense discretionary spending is proposed to exceed the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion in FY2008. Over five years, non-defense discretionary outlays are estimated to grow by 0.7% annually, while the Administration's proposed levels fall by an average of 0.7% annually. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to decrease from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012, dropping as a share of GDP from 3.7% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. The Administration's budget aims to reduce non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP from 3.5% in FY2008 to 2.8% in FY2012. Mandatory spending is set to increase by 4.2% from FY2007 to FY2008, with proposals to reduce mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008. This reduction would be achieved by slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in almost $60 billion in savings over five years. Mandatory spending is projected to grow from $1,465 billion in FY2007 to $1,923 billion in FY2012, representing 10.8% of GDP. Net interest outlays are expected to rise by $22.1 billion from FY2007 to FY2008. Net interest outlays are projected to rise by $22.1 billion from FY2007 to FY2008, with the Administration's proposals indicating continued growth in federal debt. The proposed net interest outlays for FY2008 exceed the current services baseline estimate by $7.8 billion, and policy proposals would raise FY2012 net interest outlays by almost $30 billion. Despite this increase, net interest payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to remain relatively stable between 1.6% and 1.8%. CBO projections show outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. Many analysts believe that current-law baseline estimates may underestimate future growth in discretionary spending. According to CBO projections, federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period if discretionary spending grew at the same rate as the economy. Alternatively, keeping discretionary spending fixed at FY2007 levels would result in a $1.65 trillion decrease in federal outlays. Defense spending is expected to rise from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, with projections showing it reaching $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017. Defense spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to gradually decrease over the 10-year period. Alternative scenarios, such as troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, show lower spending trajectories. Withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan would lead to significant savings in discretionary spending and interest costs, according to CBO projections. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to increase over the years, but as a percentage of GDP, it will decrease. The CBO and Administration projections both show a shrinking relative size of discretionary spending over time. The CBO projects an increase in mandatory spending from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion in FY2017. Net interest payments are expected to grow from $235 billion in FY2007 to $278 billion in FY2017. The federal debt's growth is projected to slow down, with surpluses in FY2012 and beyond reducing the debt. Net interest as a share of GDP is forecasted to decrease gradually to 1.3% in FY2017. The Senate and House Budget Committees proposed budget resolutions for FY2008, with outlays increasing over the years. The resolutions included defense funding and domestic spending, with slight differences in amounts. The CBO projected growth in mandatory spending and net interest payments, with a decrease in the federal debt and net interest as a share of GDP by FY2017. The President's proposed budget for FY2007-FY2012 shows a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would lift mandatory spending relative to GDP above current levels. The President's FY2008 budget proposal includes four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017. The proposed outlays decrease sharply after FY2007 due to reductions in discretionary spending and growth moderation in some mandatory programs. The Mid-Session Review (MSR) projects slightly higher outlays compared to the February budget, mainly due to reestimation. The alternative estimate, based on CBO data, includes assumptions that directly impact outlays. The President's FY2008 budget proposal includes assumptions that increase outlays above baseline projections, leading to a higher deficit and federal debt. The alternative estimate projects outlays as a percentage of GDP to rise to 21.1% by FY2017, with higher net interest payments contributing to this growth. The federal revenue streams are affected by economic conditions, leading to imprecise forecasts beyond the short term. Receipts have shown rapid growth in recent fiscal years, with increases in GDP share and current dollars. OMB and CBO have different projections for receipts as a share of GDP, with varying growth rates and impacts of tax cuts. The President's proposals aim to extend and make permanent expiring tax cuts, leading to a significant rise in receipts over the forecast period. The budget proposal aims to extend and make permanent expiring tax cuts, leading to a slight decrease in receipts as a percentage of GDP in the short term, followed by a gradual increase. Making the tax cuts permanent is estimated to reduce cumulative receipts by a significant amount over the next decade. The budget also includes relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008. Actual receipts as a percentage of GDP for FY2000 through FY2006 show various trends in different tax categories. Corporate income taxes stabilize near 2% of GDP, while individual income taxes remain below their FY2000 level. The Administration's proposals include extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008, with estimated costs for temporary fixes and indexing AMT thresholds for inflation. The budget aims to limit the reach of the AMT but lacks estimates for the five-year period. The budget aims to limit the reach of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) but lacks estimates for the five-year cost of such a fix. Omitting these estimates increases federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year. CBO's baseline revenue estimates show an increase to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and to 20.1% of GDP in FY2017. Extending expiring tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would also reduce revenues. The CBO estimated that limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and $570 billion over 10 years. The differences in economic assumptions between the Administration and CBO estimates accounted for most of the revenue variances. CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than CBO's baseline estimates over five years. The President's budget projected cumulative revenues of $14,826 billion over five years, while CBO's reestimates put cumulative revenues at $14,524 billion, 2% less. The CBO's alternative revenue estimates show slower growth in receipts compared to the baseline, with receipts falling to approximately 17.5% of GDP by FY2012. This alternative projection results in $70 billion less revenue in FY2008, $389 billion less in FY2012, and $560 billion less in FY2017 compared to the baseline. The House and Senate budget resolutions do not include extending expiring tax provisions without offsetting their cost. The House and Senate budget resolutions require revenue changes to be offset to prevent deficit growth or surplus decline. The conference agreement allows for extending expiring tax cuts under certain conditions and offsetting revenue losses. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown, with estimates remaining fairly close through FY2010. CBO's revenue reestimate extends to FY2017, with receipts rising to slightly above 19% of GDP. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years, with OMB projecting slightly larger receipts than the February budget. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing federal debt and interest payments. Running surpluses during strong economic growth is seen as beneficial by many economists. The federal government last ran a surplus in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate. The FY2007 on-budget deficit was $344 billion. The President's budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a small surplus in FY2012. Surpluses were projected to appear in FY2010 according to the Administration's baseline estimates. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew compared to the President's budget estimates. The President's FY2008 budget projected deficit reduction goals through FY2012, with strict limits on discretionary spending and slower growth of entitlement spending. CBO's baseline estimates show a projected federal deficit decrease through FY2011, with surpluses projected from FY2012 to FY2017. The baseline assumes no fix to the AMT and the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of alternative policies on the federal deficit, including limiting AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending. These policies would lead to a growing deficit from FY2007 to FY2017, with deficits increasing from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017. The CBO analysis of the President's policies projected deficits and surpluses from FY2008 to FY2012, with varying estimates compared to the Administration's projections. The House and Senate budget resolutions also showed differences in deficit/surplus amounts, with the conference agreement resulting in a deficit in FY2008 turning into a surplus by FY2012. Deficits and surpluses as shares of GDP are shown in Figure 5 for FY2007 through FY2017. The data from FY2000 through FY2006 and estimates from CBO and OMB for FY2008 to FY2017 show a declining deficit as a share of GDP, with a projected surplus in FY2012. The President's policy proposals included increased defense spending, controls on domestic discretionary spending, and changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. CBO and OMB projections indicate an improving federal fiscal situation, with deficits decreasing relative to the economy. The CBO's alternative deficit projection shows a steady deterioration in the federal government's fiscal conditions, with deficits reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. OMB, CBO, and GAO all agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The CBO projects that keeping federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic spending cuts in all areas except Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending on these programs is expected to reach 15% of GDP, necessitating significant budget cuts to maintain overall spending levels. The aging population and rising healthcare costs will pose challenges for fiscal policy in the coming decades, requiring substantial reductions in projected spending growth. The Federal Government's major entitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are projected to place a growing and unsustainable burden on the budget by 2050. Estimates show that spending on these programs will exceed 15% of GDP, presenting different challenges to the long-term fiscal position. The fiscal gap between Social Security and Medicare outlays and revenues is a significant concern, especially sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding productivity growth. The long-term budget outlook for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is sensitive to changes in assumptions about productivity growth and medical inflation. Unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns can impact the short-term budget. The retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs will put pressure on the federal budget, potentially overwhelming it without policy changes. The expansion of programs could strain the economy's resources and ability to meet new needs."
