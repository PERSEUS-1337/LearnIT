    "content": "The aiding and abetting subsection of 18 U.S.C. 2 holds individuals accountable for assisting in the commission of federal crimes. It requires the defendant to associate themselves with the crime, participate in it, and actively contribute to its success. This secondary liability is similar to conspiracy laws, as society fears the crimes of multiple individuals more than those of one. The aiding and abetting law under 18 U.S.C. 2 requires the defendant to know about the crime and contribute to its success, even minimally. It is not necessary to aid in every aspect of the offense. Aiding and abetting is not a federal offense itself but describes how a defendant's actions led to a violation of the law. The aiding and abetting law requires the defendant to contribute to the crime's success, even minimally. A completed offense is necessary for conviction, and assistance after the crime is a separate offense. Sometimes accomplices void federal principles of secondary liability, especially when there is a substantial culpability gap. This often involves victims, customers, and subordinates, with not every victim qualifying for the exception based on culpability. The Hobbs Act outlaws extortion by public officials, but customers who are willing participants in corrupt schemes may be convicted for bribery or as accomplices. Examples from the Supreme Court show that customers like drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts may escape conviction as co-conspirators. In cases like United States v. Farrar and Rewis v. United States, the Court ruled that mere bettors cannot be prosecuted as aiders and abettors in illegal activities. The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) reinforces the view that a drug trafficker's customers cannot be prosecuted as coconspirators or aiders and abettors. Federal law punishes the trafficker severely for possession with intent to distribute, but punishes the customer for simple possession. The Supreme Court held in Gebardi that a woman agreeing to be transported for immoral purposes could not be charged with conspiracy. Lower federal courts continued to honor this ruling, limiting it to cases where the prostitute did not actively participate in her transportation. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) does not allow prosecution of employees as aiders and abettors of OSHA offenders. In contrast, subordinates supervised by offenders of the federal gambling business statute can be prosecuted. There is uncertainty regarding the treatment of subordinates of a drug kingpin. Section 2(b) of the law applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. It covers situations where the intermediary is aware of their actions contributing to the offense, regardless of their role. Section 2(b) of the law applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. It imposes no liability unless the actions of the defendant and his intermediary together constitute an offense. The amendment adding \"willfully\" in 1951 remains unclear in its purpose, with speculation that it was to address a lack of a mental element in the statute. Courts interpret \"willfully\" as a form of intentional causation. In aiding and abetting cases, individuals may be held liable under \u00a72(b) if they intentionally use someone else to commit a crime, even if they are unaware that the conduct is criminal. Federal courts mention a withdrawal defense similar to conspiracy cases, where withdrawal is not a defense for the conspiracy itself but for crimes committed after withdrawal. Withdrawal from aiding and abetting may be more limited, with no liability if the offense is not completed due to the withdrawal of assistance. In cases of aiding and abetting, the question of withdrawal from the crime is uncertain. Some courts have different views on whether a defendant can withdraw from aiding and abetting. Proponents of a withdrawal defense point to a case involving Rosemond, where the Supreme Court suggested that an accomplice might be able to withdraw and avoid liability before the crime is committed. Congress has not enacted a general civil aiding and abetting statute. When Congress enacts a statute allowing a person to sue a private defendant for violating a statutory norm, there is no presumption that the plaintiff can also sue aiders and abettors. Courts have ruled that aiders and abettors are not civilly liable for violations of various acts such as the Anti-Terrorism Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Stored Communications Act, or RICO."
