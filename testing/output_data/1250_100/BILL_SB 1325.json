Plans must comply with the California Environmental Quality Act and involve public input before approval or modification. The department determines significant modifications for hazardous waste facilities permits based on class 3 criteria in regulations. Public concern and complexity also factor into the decision. The department retains authority to take immediate action for public health and safety. If the department imposes a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan through an enforcement order or agreement, the owner must pay specified fees and may face enforcement actions for violations. The department may require corrective action to protect health and the environment, assess penalties for violations, and issue postclosure permits for hazardous waste facilities. Regulations for postclosure plan requirements must be adopted by January 1, 2018. The department has the authority to order necessary actions at a facility to protect public health, safety, or the environment.
