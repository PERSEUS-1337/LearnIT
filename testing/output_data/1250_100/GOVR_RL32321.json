    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly recognized as more suitable for law and order tasks. Members of Congress are exploring tools for effective security in unstable regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. The FY2005 foreign relations authorization bill (S. 2144) recognizes the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations in promoting stability in post-conflict situations. Policymakers are addressing issues with CivPol capabilities and considering improvements to the existing system. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for post-conflict missions. Key reform efforts include recommendations to enhance CivPol systems and approaches. The Clinton Administration's PDD-71 and the UN's Brahimi Panel report addressed issues with CivPol systems. The Bush Administration has started implementing measures from PDD-71, while the UN is working on implementing some of the Brahimi Panel recommendations. Proposed reforms include creating a reserve CivPol force and diversifying international police forces. The current report discusses the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, including the establishment of specialized police units and civilian response mechanisms. Policymakers are exploring ways to improve CivPol mechanisms to reduce reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The report also includes a chart summarizing past operations and details the expansion of policing in U.N. and U.S.-led operations during the 1990s. The report discusses the increase in international civilian police (UNCIVPOLs) in U.N. operations from 1994 to 2000, with a current deployment of 4,655 officers as of February 29, 2004. Recommendations for improving CivPol mechanisms and options for U.S. Congress are provided. Several nations, including the United States, provide bilateral assistance, especially training, to indigenous police forces in post-conflict situations. Analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with exceptions for post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been utilized for various purposes since the late 19th century, with functions including support for human rights, monitoring, advising, reporting, and training. These forces have evolved through five phases aimed at establishing security in peacekeeping operations, sometimes armed with arrest powers. The details of their assistance are determined on a case-by-case basis due to the lack of specific statutory authority for regulation and funding. The evolution of international civilian police forces in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, involving expanding U.N. activities, adding training components, reforming existing police institutions, creating new institutions, adding constabulary units for hostile situations, and granting international police executive authority to bear arms and make arrests. The evolution of international civilian police forces in peacekeeping operations has progressed through various phases, including expanding U.N. activities, adding training components, reforming existing police institutions, creating new institutions, and granting international police executive authority to bear arms and make arrests. Policymakers and analysts have focused on improving mechanisms for implementing peacekeeping mandates, emphasizing the need for clear and feasible mandates and the development of standards and procedures for effective implementation. The gaps in implementing peacekeeping mandates have been identified as a concern for U.S. policymakers. One problem area is the recruitment and training mechanisms, particularly for the United Nations, which struggles to recruit well-trained and professional policemen due to diverse standards and practices. Despite efforts to address these issues, challenges persist as missions become more complex and demanding. The challenges in recruiting personnel with all necessary skills and the need for additional training to improve policing skills and professionalism are key issues in peacekeeping missions. There are also three security gaps hindering the establishment of law and order in post-conflict situations, including the deployment gap where police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. These gaps can be problematic in situations where not all parties are committed to peace or where criminal networks are present. The challenges in recruiting personnel with necessary skills and the need for additional training are key issues in peacekeeping missions. The deployment gap hinders the establishment of law and order in post-conflict situations, as police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. The enforcement gap refers to the inability of deployed police forces to provide the necessary security for normal policing operations, often lacking the skills needed for constabulary functions in hostile situations. The challenges in recruiting personnel with necessary skills and the need for additional training are key issues in peacekeeping missions. The deployment gap hinders the establishment of law and order in post-conflict situations, as police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. The enforcement gap refers to the inability of deployed police forces to provide the necessary security for normal policing operations, often lacking the skills needed for constabulary functions in hostile situations. International police assistance has been provided through multilateral and unilateral mechanisms since the end of the Cold War, with the United Nations playing a principal role. The institution gap arises when indigenous law enforcement systems lack adequate personnel and institutions to effectively follow up on police work with prosecution and punishment necessary for sustainable security in post-conflict situations. The United Nations and other countries play important roles in international police operations. The UN international civilian police system provides assistance through multilateral operations, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in various missions. Jordan is the largest contributor, followed by the United States, India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The largest mission is in Kosovo, with other missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. Many nations, including the United States, European Union member states, and organizations like OSCE and EU, have provided police assistance and training in various international missions. The US has been involved in peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Haiti, as well as developing police training programs in Somalia through ICITAP. Other countries such as the UK, Germany, Sweden, and Italy have also contributed to police assistance efforts. OSCE and EU have taken the lead in specific missions, often in conjunction with UN missions. The OSCE has provided CivPols for police training in Kosovo and other countries. The EU took over the police mission in Bosnia in 2003 and launched the PROXIMA mission in Macedonia. U.N. Member States contribute police personnel for peacekeeping operations based on international standards for democratic policing and human rights. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides direction for all components of operations in the field, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division is responsible for policy, planning, and management of civilian policing activities. UNCIVPOL personnel are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner in the field. The Brahimi Panel report addresses problems in the UN peacekeeping system and proposes reforms. The Brahimi Panel report identified issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel in UN peacekeeping missions. It recommended actions to improve rapid deployment of CivPols, including establishing ready rosters, developing on-call lists, forming regional partnerships for training, and appointing national points of contact. Additionally, conferences were held to address problems and propose solutions for UN policing operations. The meetings of donor countries and UNDPKO seminar proposed reforms to address recruitment, training, and deployment issues in UNCIVPOL. Recommendations included incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system, pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment, and addressing procedural and organizational impediments. While some reforms have been implemented, significant problems persist. Constraints on UNCIVPOL reform are also discussed. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a doctrinal shift in UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing reform and restructuring over monitoring and training activities. This shift required better-trained law enforcement personnel to work alongside rule of law professionals to strengthen all rule of law institutions. The Brahimi Panel recommended a shift in UNCIVPOL operations towards reform and restructuring, requiring better-trained law enforcement personnel to work with rule of law professionals. However, implementing this approach faces challenges within the UN system due to limited resources and concerns about infringing on national sovereignty. Despite efforts to integrate rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations, progress is viewed as \"lagging\" according to a report by the Henry L. Stimson Center. The UNDPKO faced challenges in recruiting law enforcement personnel for rule of law operations, with only two out of six requested posts filled. This hindered the deployment of missions with a criminal justice component. Recruitment issues included uneven results in finding qualified police officers and a lack of specialized skills. The absence of a comprehensive U.N. civilian police strategy further compounded these challenges. The absence of a comprehensive U.N. civilian police strategy has made it difficult to determine mission needs and recruit suitable civilian police personnel with appropriate skills. The current criteria for civilian police officers include a minimum age of 25, five years of service in a national police force with community policing experience, proficiency in an official U.N. language, possession of a driver's license, ability to operate a four-wheel drive vehicle, and meeting medical standards. Executive authority missions require officers with firearms experience. Since 1996, the United Nations has sent Selection Assistance Teams (SATs) to guide Member States in selecting police candidates, focusing on language, driving, and firearms skills. Retraining and retesting of basic requirements continue in the mission upon arrival, reducing repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills remains challenging, with better success in general skills than in advance recruiting for specialists in training, investigations, and organized areas. Recruitment for specialized skills in areas such as training, investigations, organized crime, forensics, drug trafficking, and police intelligence remains challenging. Recommendations have been made for advance recruitment of personnel to improve quality and speed deployment, but implementation success has been mixed. The Brahimi Panel Report suggested establishing a national \"ready roster\" of pre-selected CivPol personnel under the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements for quick deployment. The UNSAS recommendations include creating a ready roster of international police personnel with job descriptions and specialization. Progress has been made in strengthening UNSAS, but there is a lack of individual candidates for international operations. The Brahimi Panel Report calls for maintaining an on-call list of 100 police officers and experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. The UNDPKO established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel for advance mission planning. 10 out of 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the on-call lists. Training exercises have been conducted to improve the on-call system efficiency. Recruitment efforts now include substantive skills as selection criteria. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures that hinder recruitment. The U.N. audit in 2001 criticized the lack of standardized criteria for determining civilian police numbers in missions like UNMIBH and UNMIK. UNDPKO was faulted for not matching skills appropriately, leading to civilian police performing non-policing functions. A significant percentage of civilian police were assigned to administrative tasks, reducing the number available for policing duties. Training for civilian police in UN missions varies among Member States and is often considered inadequate. Lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training can undermine mission effectiveness. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training, and in-theater training covers standard procedures, safety, security, human rights, and language skills. Inadequate training is attributed to civilian police officers being drawn from multiple countries with varying practices and little UN experience. Experts have identified three main reasons for inadequate pre-deployment training for civilian police in UN missions: lack of experienced trainers, insufficient resources for training programs, and varying national training standards. Recommendations from the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO include developing regional partnerships for joint training exercises and using UN educational materials for pre-training personnel. Efforts by the UNDPKO Training Unit have been made to improve pre-deployment training by providing training publications to assist Member States. UNDPKO has developed common training standards and generic training modules to ensure uniformity in the competence of deployed peacekeepers, including police. PDD-71 recognized the need for international organizations to supplement national training and called for tailored training packages to be provided by the State Department's INL office. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving mission definition, recruitment, and procurement. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The State Department aims to invite foreign police officers for training with the U.S. contingent, but specific arrangements are still being determined. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommendations addressed the lack of reserve mission leadership, standby arrangement unreliability, and equipment shortages for peacekeeping missions. They proposed a rapid deployment period of 4-12 weeks after Security Council authorization, with full deployment within 30 days for traditional missions and 90 days for complex emergencies. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations noted challenges in meeting the 30-90 day deployment timeframe for military and police personnel. The current U.N. system faces challenges in handling multiple missions simultaneously and lacks region-specific expertise in civilian standby arrangements. Reform efforts are underway to improve rapid deployment capabilities, including the development of a 100-person roster of civilian police personnel. Equipment pre-packaging and storage at the U.N. Logistics Base in Italy have been enhanced, but there is a need for a program to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many U.N. Member States have generic rapid deployment programs, but few have the capability to deploy quickly. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the U.S. CivPol program, recruiting civilian police personnel from local agencies through contractors. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of personnel, but a new arrangement with DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC has been initiated to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel. The U.S. CivPol program recruits and prescreens personnel through contractors like DynCorp International. A joint venture with PAE Government Services, Inc., and HomeLand Security Corporation maintains rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deployment. Funding comes from various State Department bureaus, with officers receiving salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000. Additional allowances are provided for U.N. missions, with total costs varying by mission. The private contractor DynCorp provides police services in Kosovo and Iraq, with costs covering salaries, equipment, transportation, and support services. The United Nations covers expenses in Kosovo, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the incremental cost per troop in Iraq. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were participating in international missions. As of March 27, 2004, 479 police officers and 26 support personnel were deployed in various countries including Liberia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Additionally, the United States provided 408 police officers and support personnel as unilateral contributions to Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. policymakers have recognized recruitment and deployment challenges for qualified CivPol personnel, with PDD-71 aiming to enhance response capacities and operational activities. The U.S. CivPol system aims to improve the capacity of foreign police in peace operations by addressing issues such as matching skills with mission requirements, training inconsistencies, and deployment delays. The Department of State has introduced a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for rapid deployment, with a contractor responsible for recruitment, training, and support services. This initiative builds upon the PDD-71 mandate to enhance response capacities and operational activities. The State Department introduced a new cadre of U.S. civilian police to streamline recruitment, training, and deployment for international CivPol operations. Contracts were awarded to multiple companies, raising concerns about potential delays and costs. The original RFP provisions and the extent to which they apply under the new contracts are unclear. The original RFP provisions and the extent to which they apply under the new contracts are unclear. Recruitment for international police missions has raised concerns about the recruitment method drawing from overextended municipal and state forces, exacerbated by repeated call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces. Some analysts suggest compensating state and municipal governments for detailing police officers to international missions to improve recruitment quality. They argue that individual officer recruitment has made the U.S. police contingent less cohesive and that selection criteria do not accurately reflect mission requirements. The Department of State has specific requirements for individuals interested in joining international police missions, including U.S. citizenship, years of law enforcement experience, a clean record, a valid driver's license, and the ability to communicate in English. Specialized skills are also increasingly sought after, with the State Department's CivPol cadre program aiming to recruit nearly 55% specialists. The CivPol cadre program aims to recruit nearly 55% specialists with specific qualifications including interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills. Selected individuals will receive annual training in policing skills essential for effective law enforcement. The program intends to incentivize high-quality officers to join by offering training that could lead to career advancement. However, the funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. The current U.S. CivPol program has been criticized for the insufficient training provided to police officers recruited from various departments. The pre-deployment training includes topics like UN operations, mission overview, human rights, and defensive tactics. An improved training curriculum is being developed to meet nationwide police officer standards. The improved training curriculum being developed by INL aims to meet nationwide Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) certification requirements and align with international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The new program seeks recognition and certification from U.S. and select foreign law enforcement organizations. Deployment of the U.S. CivPol contingent to a U.N. operation can currently be done within 30-45 days following a U.N. Security Council authorization. The proposed legislation (H.R. 1414) aims to deploy UNCIVPOL within 15 days of U.N. Security Council authorization. Questions arise about maintaining deployment capability under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and provide logistical support to enhance operational capabilities. Deployment may be slowed by new bidding rounds for each mission. European countries deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations, except for the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has set goals to enhance the quality and timeliness of European contributions to police missions, including developing a 5,000 civilian reserve police force by 2003. The European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) adopted at the December 1999 Helsinki Summit of European heads of state and government includes police capabilities for civilian crisis management operations. The EU established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) to provide flexible funding arrangements for police missions, with Member States committing up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations. Member States have also committed to providing rapidly deployable police units and headquarters units for police missions. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2003, aiming to establish sustainable policing arrangements. The mission consists of 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states, with an annual budget of $47.2 million. A second police mission began in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2003, with an authorized strength of 200 police and civilian personnel and a budget of $18.6 million for the first year. The EU has met its goals for police officer commitments and rapid deployment. Analysts are skeptical about the effectiveness of EU crisis management reforms due to Member States' reluctance to surrender national sovereignty. The OSCE has 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries and has a Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams program for conflict prevention and crisis management. The REACT program within the OSCE aims to deploy qualified civilian experts, including CivPols, for conflict prevention and crisis management. Participating States can establish their own database of experts to promote security in various areas. The program was established in April 2001 and has seen improvements in implementation, including creating national websites for recruitment. Many OSCE States prefer this program over U.N. lists for efficiency and privacy reasons. OSCE participating States prefer not to nominate specific individuals to the OSCE availability list until field requirements are known. Some States have provided numerical commitments in specific expertise areas. The OSCE has developed standards for educational and experience requirements, as well as a staffing matrix to assist in recruiting qualified candidates. Through REACT, CivPols are recruited for advising, mentoring, and development functions. General minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication skills, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and proficiency in operating police radio equipment. In the 108th Congress, three bills were introduced to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. H.R. 1414 aims to enhance UNCIVPOL capabilities, H.R. 2616 addresses issues with U.S. CivPol capabilities and proposes creating capabilities within NATO for post-conflict stabilization, and S. 2127 seeks to improve the U.S.'s ability to respond to crises abroad. These proposals build on previous efforts to enhance international capabilities in law enforcement and rule of law. H.R. 1414, the International Rule of Law and Antiterrorism Act of 2003, proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more effective and rapidly deployable. It calls for the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) that can be deployed within 15 days of a U.N. Security Council authorization for peacekeeping operations. The bill aims to address recruitment and training issues within UNCIVPOL. The bill H.R. 1414 proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) composed of law enforcement professionals trained and equipped for civilian policing functions in U.N. peace operations. It also calls for appropriate resources, including funding, equipment, training, and staffing, to be provided for the corps. Additionally, the bill aims to improve the current system by establishing standards and training programs for international civilian police within the United Nations. The bill H.R. 1414 proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) to address deployment and enforcement gaps. Proponents argue for adequate funding and specify the size of the UNCPC. The bill aims to improve UN's ability to maintain a secure environment by reducing the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks. Opponents fear the cost and establishment of a standing corps, which could increase assessed contributions. Many analysts express concerns about funding the United Nations civilian police corps through voluntary contributions, fearing sustainability issues. There are also worries about the UN's limited management capacity and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, proposes new mechanisms for providing security in post-conflict situations, including the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve. The proposal suggests establishing a U.S. civilian police reserve to serve overseas in post-conflict situations and train indigenous police forces. It also calls for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services in such situations. Congress would establish a task force to develop the reserve, while NATO would be asked to train and equip selected units for security in reconstruction. The proposed legislation aims to establish a U.S. civilian police reserve to support international efforts in post-conflict reconstruction by providing security and training for indigenous police forces. This reserve would be capable of tasks such as controlling belligerent groups, supporting police investigations, and apprehending targeted individuals. Proponents believe this initiative would help bridge deployment gaps and enhance international security capabilities. Proponents of establishing a civilian police reserve debate between a private contractor model and a government-sponsored reserve force. The private sector model is favored for its quick response time and avoidance of new government bureaucracies. However, concerns exist about contractors' dedication and adaptability. On the other hand, a government reserve force could be as efficient as a private contractor if law enforcement personnel were maintained as paid reservists, albeit at a higher cost. Proponents argue that a government reserve force would be a more potent symbol of U.S. commitment, responsive to U.S. policy, and cohesive. They believe it would be more accountable and could guarantee better quality recruits through stringent screening mechanisms. Additionally, a government agency could easily draw qualified personnel from local and state police departments, especially if a compensation system is established. Training together and coordinating with military forces could further enhance the effectiveness of a government-sponsored reserve force. A government reserve force could be more effective and reliable than the current ad hoc model. Some suggest a NATO constabulary capability to bridge enforcement gaps, but there are concerns about using military organizations for policing functions. Critics worry about duplication of structures and potential friction in U.S.-European relations. Analysts recommend additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination with the military in the bill. Some critics argue that the creation of U.S. or international police reserves without standardized training could perpetuate policing style differences and undermine operations. Concerns include delays in deployment due to lack of equipment commitment. The bill S. 2127 aims to strengthen civilian rule of law and capabilities, but skeptics question the need for such forces and the commitment of U.S. police officers. Biden introduced the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) to reorganize government structures for quicker response to overseas crises. The bill would provide $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve, consisting of federal and non-government personnel trained for missions. 10% of State Department and USAID personnel would be trained for this force within three years of enactment. The legislation introduced by Senator Lugar does not specify the types of personnel to be recruited for stability operations. Experts suggest that improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel could help bridge deployment gaps. Pre-deployment training has not kept pace with the increasing scope of police missions, leading to adjustments in the field on a case-by-case basis. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages to CivPol when requested. Increased police training is recommended to address cost prohibitive training for personnel. The State Department's proposal includes provision for U.S. training of foreign police, pending funding availability. Another option is to enhance international constabulary capabilities in nations with existing forces and create new capabilities where needed. H.R. 2616 proposes incorporating a unit within NATO for constabulary functions. Constabulary police perform tasks that require less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement. They regulate movements for safety, intervene in civil violence, and disperse unruly demonstrations. Trained in military and policing skills, they are essential in post-conflict areas. Deployed in formed units, they can respond rapidly and have their own communication and logistical support. Several countries have specialized paramilitary police units trained as constabulary forces, such as the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil. These resources can be strained by high deployment rates in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Some argue for the U.S. army to develop its own active duty constabulary force to augment military police in peacekeeping operations. Army analysts and policymakers are considering this option, despite resistance from Army leaders. Army leaders have resisted structuring the service for peacekeeping operations, arguing that it weakens the military's primary warfighting mission. However, analysts question if military forces truly win wars without establishing conditions for durable peace. Proponents advocate for constabulary forces as an intermediary security force for peace operations, reducing reliance on combat soldiers and shortening withdrawal time from post-conflict situations. Regular military forces often perform constabulary functions in peacekeeping operations despite lacking training and resources. Analysts are uncertain if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities for peacekeeping operations. Some suggest developing rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel for sustainable security. The United States currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts. The State Department's INL CivPol program seeks to identify personnel for a new CivPol cadre program to enhance peacekeeping capabilities. Robert S. Perito advocates for integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" to address post-conflict security gaps and impunity. This proposed U.S. stability force would consist of four elements. The proposed U.S. stability force, as outlined by Perito, includes robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. These forces would deploy concurrently to provide security from the outset and bridge deployment gaps. Military shifts to perimeter security post-major combat, constabulary units handle internal security, civilian police maintain public safety, and justice experts complete the framework. The proposed U.S. stability force includes military, civilian constabulary units, police, and justice experts to provide security and restore public safety. The military component gradually transitions control to the civilian component. Recommendations from reports suggest the deployment of civilian personnel alongside combat forces for nation-building responsibilities, and the creation of interagency teams for stabilization and reconstruction. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recommends establishing an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State. This agency would manage a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians and a Civilian Stability Operations Reserve of non-government civilians for rapid deployment. Proponents argue that deploying rule of law personnel early on enhances long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries, allowing for earlier military withdrawal. The creation of a new federal agency is proposed to provide constabulary and police personnel for international civilian police components. This model, different from the reserve proposed in H.R. 2616, aims to establish security more rapidly in crisis countries by federalizing at least the CivPol component. Deployment ease will depend on the recruitment and hiring methods used. Perito suggests federalizing the CivPol component of the stability force for quicker deployment, rather than hiring through private contractors. Rapid deployment of personnel may depend on recruitment arrangements and benefits provided. Sources include Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations website and information from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) website. The chart excludes U.N. civilian police missions with fewer than 100 authorized or deployed personnel. European nations sent police units to advise and train local forces in the late 1800s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping was in 1960. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping was in 1960 during the U.N. Operation in the Congo. This involved Ghanaian and Nigerian contingents assisting the Congolese police in maintaining order. Subsequently, the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was established in 1964, marking the first multilateral U.N. police force. The UNFICYP CivPols helped maintain order and security in sensitive areas to diffuse tensions. Monitoring mandates for local police officers began in 1989 through 1992. The monitoring of local police officers began in 1989 through 1992, with operations in Namibia and Western Sahara. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process and investigated complaints about the police. This mission set the tasks for future monitoring missions, including accompanying local police, receiving public complaints, and supervising investigations. The U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Southwest Sahara (MINURSO) followed in 1991. The United Nations established temporary administrations for monitoring and carrying out referendums in Southwest Sahara, Angola, and Cambodia. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary in these missions. The U.N. Protection Force peacekeeping operation in Yugoslavia faced challenges due to inadequate mandates and insufficient military forces. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a large and ambitious mission. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a significant peacekeeping operation with a focus on investigating violations of political liberties and human rights. The mission faced challenges due to delays in deployment and the late authorization of arrest powers for CivPols. The UNTAC police mission initially adjusted its efforts from ensuring law and order to monitoring elections due to inadequate police numbers. Training for Cambodian police and judiciary was recognized as essential, with some civil police conducting makeshift training. An \"institution gap\" was identified, as the lack of an independent judicial system hindered justice promotion by UNTAC police. The idea of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" of justice and penal officials, as well as police officers, was developed to address the enforcement gap. The reform of police forces became a pivotal element in the U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL), which aimed to put internal security forces under civilian control. The reform role for international police forces was established through peace accords in January 1992, ending El Salvador's civil war and leading to the creation of a new National Civilian Police force. The ONUSAL mission in El Salvador aimed to assist in the reform of the police force and judicial system. They provided UNCIVPOLs to cooperate in ensuring a smooth transition and assisting police authorities. ONUSAL oversaw the formation of a new police academy and force with support from international partners. The new police force was crucial for the country's reconciliation efforts. The creation of a new police force in El Salvador was considered a success despite encountering significant problems. The success convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. Subsequent missions, like the one in Mozambique, also focused on training and reform mandates for civilian police. The ONUMOZ mission in Mozambique focused on monitoring and verifying police reorganization and training, with follow-up reform programs conducted through bilateral training. International efforts in Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti also emphasized training and reform, with the U.S.-led UNITAF mission establishing an Auxiliary Security Force in Somalia. The UNITAF mission in Somalia established an Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) to enforce local laws and be controlled by the community. The ASF aimed to reduce the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, minimize casualties, and create jobs for unemployed Somalis. The ASF in Somalia received substantial assistance from UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations. The UNDP paid salaries, provided equipment, and refurbished police stations. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts worked with the ASF. UNITAF provided surplus vehicles and radios, while military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the UAE offered training and conducted joint patrols. The World Food Program provided food rations. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993 when the ASF had 5,000 members operating in Mogadishu and 17 other cities and towns. In December 1993, the U.N. announced plans to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994. Despite ambitious reconstruction efforts, the U.N. faced challenges due to inadequate staffing and funding. Training programs for Somali police officers collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity. The collapse of training programs for Somali police officers in the 1990s was attributed to escalating violence and insecurity, leading to a lack of U.N. military presence. The UNITAF ASF achieved some success in providing protection to citizens, but by the end of the decade, the need for police institution development was recognized. The Brahimi Panel Report in August 2000 recommended a shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations to focus on building local police capacity. UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs in Somalia contributed to the concept of a law enforcement gap. Analysts identified a law enforcement gap in post-conflict Somalia, where military force was sometimes necessary to maintain order due to the lack of a peace accord. International civilian police forces struggled without an effective cease-fire, and there were challenges in training local police. The absence of adequate courts and a political settlement also hindered police reform efforts in the long term. Similar issues were seen in Haiti. In Haiti, U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts faced challenges due to institutional gaps. The Multilateral Force (MFN) and International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) worked to develop a new Haitian national police force. Subsequent U.N. missions continued the work of professionalizing the police over the next five years. In Haiti, the U.S. and U.N. worked on police reform efforts, coordinating with the military and civilian police to establish public security while training the Haitian National Police. The military adjusted rules of engagement to detain or shoot criminals, filling deployment gaps until the HNP was fully deployed. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to the IPMs. Unlike Somalia, there was a smooth transition between the U.S.-led MNF and the UNMIH operation in Haiti. In Haiti, the UNMIH provided rapid backup to the UNCIVPOL and MPs for liaison and technical assistance. They also contributed to stability by conducting military patrols. The institutional gap, including overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system, hindered public security establishment. In Bosnia, the UN created Special Constabulary Units from 1995-1999 to assist with international police efforts under the Dayton Accords. The United Nations was assigned the role by the December 1995 Dayton Accords to oversee a joint government in Bosnia. This was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) as part of the UN Mission to Bosnia and Hercegovina (UNMIBH). The UN's responsibilities included monitoring, advising, training, and facilitating law enforcement activities. In January 2003, the European Union took over the responsibility for monitoring and training police in Bosnia. The EU Police Mission (EUPM) in Bosnia, with 1,721 unarmed IPTF CivPols lacking enforcement powers, faced challenges in maintaining public order among hostile groups. Concerns about insufficient mandate for international CivPol and policing function for NATO peacekeeping force were raised during Dayton negotiations. IFOR provided support to IPTF in early 1996, assisting in planning operations and organizing the force. The IPTF faced challenges in maintaining public order in Bosnia due to an \"enforcement gap\" as they lacked law enforcement powers. The death of only one person during relocation was seen as a success, but the burning and booby-trapping of dwellings highlighted the limitations of the IPTF. The flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs led to a perception of U.N. failure and loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in late 1996, providing backup when the IPTF lacked adequate force to maintain public order. The IPTF in Bosnia faced challenges in maintaining public order due to an \"enforcement gap\" and lacked adequate force. Specialized paramilitary units from foreign nations were integrated into CivPols to fill this gap, with the Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) formed in 1998 to protect officials and residents in hostile areas. The MSU successfully backed up the IPTF in preserving public order. The Bosnia experience led to the formation of specialized units in Kosovo and East Timor to maintain public order. In Kosovo, NATO and the UN provided security through KFOR and UNMIK, with international police granted executive authority powers due to the absence of local authority. In East Timor, UNTAET also had international civilian police with executive authority. In Kosovo and East Timor, international organizations were given executive authority to oversee and train local police forces in the absence of local authority. This was necessary to fill the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of Indonesian security forces in East Timor. Despite some arguing for the inevitability of executive authority in such situations, many analysts view it as problematic and not a wise choice for future scenarios. The number of available international civilian police personnel is limited, making it difficult to recruit and deploy them in a timely manner. Practitioners and policymakers must make case-by-case decisions on the desirability of executive policing when local police forces are unsuited for their duties. Sovereignty considerations will also play a significant role in these decisions."
