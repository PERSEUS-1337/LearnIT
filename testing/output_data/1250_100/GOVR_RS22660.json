    "content": "Members of Congress have introduced legislation to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to allow the importation of FDA-approved drugs from lower-priced foreign sources. Senator Dorgan introduced S. 1232, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009, which aims to address rising concerns over prescription drug spending. The bill is similar to previous versions introduced in Congress and seeks to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs with safety measures. Legislation has been introduced to allow the importation of FDA-approved drugs from lower-priced foreign sources in order to reduce the financial burden on U.S. consumers. However, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must certify that the importation program is safe and cost-effective before it can be implemented. Previous administrations have raised concerns about safety and cost, but importation provisions were included in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA, P.L. 108-173) retained the certification requirement for drug importation. The Obama Administration is open to drug importation activities, proposing to allow Americans to buy safe drugs from other countries. Current law prohibits individual importation of prescription drugs, but the Secretary can permit it under certain conditions. FDA has leniently enforced the prohibition, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The FDA enforcement policy allows individuals to import a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use by affirming in writing and providing their treating physician's information. Legislation like S. 1232 aims to rewrite Section 804 to eliminate certification requirements and allow importation of prescription drugs with safety measures. This bill differs from current law in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of imported drugs. The bill, S. 1232, aims to allow importation of prescription drugs from countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the EU, with safety measures in place. It requires manufacturers to notify the HHS Secretary of any differences between imported drugs and FDA-approved drugs for the U.S. market. The bill also includes provisions to ensure cost savings for U.S. consumers and administrative arrangements for drug importation. The bill S. 1232 allows importation of prescription drugs from certain countries with safety measures. It includes criteria for adding countries to the list and requires registration, monitoring, and testing procedures. Exporters and importers from permitted countries must register, and a chain of custody documentation is required. Ongoing physical monitoring of facilities is also mandated. S. 1232 mandates physical monitoring of drug facilities and requires packaging with counterfeit-resistant technologies. Exporters and importers must mark shipping containers for compliance and include anti-counterfeiting technology. S. 1232 requires detailed information on Internet pharmacy websites, including pharmacist credentials and prescription requirements. It also mandates a \"qualifying medical relationship\" between the dispenser and patient. This legislation addresses issues such as valid prescriptions and physician-patient contact requirements, which were not previously covered by federal law before the passage of the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008. S. 1232 contains provisions to influence industry behavior, making it unlawful for manufacturers to discriminate against exporters, importers, or distributors of imported prescription drugs. Enforcement involves the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, with potential legal implications for patent infringement and drug importation. S. 1232 aims to reverse a court ruling that allows drug manufacturers to block imports of their patented products into the U.S. It proposes a fee mechanism to fund the importation program, with exporter and importer fees covering all costs. The bill also prohibits discrimination against exporters, importers, or distributors of imported prescription drugs. The Secretary would collect flat and proportional registration fees from exporters and importers under S. 1232 to fund the importation program. Fees would be based on the importer/exporter's activity level. Importation could begin after safety and cost certification by the Secretary. The bill requires a final rule for implementation within one year and allows importation of qualifying drugs 90 days after enactment. The Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009 allows importation of prescription drugs from registered exporters to individuals in the United States 90 days after enactment, and from permitted countries by registered importers one year after enactment. If any provision of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. Additional resources cover legal issues and policy analysis related to prescription drug importation."
