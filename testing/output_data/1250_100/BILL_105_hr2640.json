    "content": "The \"Partial Hospitalization Services Integrity Act of 1997\" limits the location where services can be provided, excluding skilled nursing facilities and personal residences. The amendments apply to services furnished after the enactment date. Additionally, qualifications for community mental health centers are outlined. The amendments to the Social Security Act outline qualifications for community mental health centers, including providing specific mental health services, meeting state licensing requirements, and complying with additional conditions specified by the Secretary for safety and efficiency. Additionally, the re-enrollment of providers of CMHC partial hospitalization services is addressed. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will ensure periodic re-certification for community mental health centers providing partial hospitalization services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The first re-certification must be completed within 1 year of the enactment of this Act. Additionally, a prospective payment system for partial hospitalization services is established. The Secretary may establish a prospective payment system for partial hospitalization services provided by community mental health centers or hospitals to outpatients. The system will ensure appropriate payment levels for efficient centers and consider payment levels for similar services by other entities. Payment amounts will be set to match total payments that would have been made without the system in the first year and maintained in subsequent years. The payment amount for partial hospitalization services provided by community mental health centers or hospitals is updated annually based on the consumer price index. Coinsurance for certain services is adjusted to reflect the payment basis established under section 1833(p). Conforming amendments are made to sections 1832(a)(2) and 1833(a) of the Act. The amendments made to the payment basis for partial hospitalization services include adding a new paragraph and adjusting percentages. These changes apply to services provided after a specified effective date. SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATION FOR IMPROVED PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION SERVICES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement a project under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act for community mental health centers to offer expanded partial hospitalization services. These services include outpatient mental health services and other appropriate mental health services. Centers serving populations in 3 different States, with one predominantly rural, will be selected for participation in the project. The Secretary may waive provisions of title XVIII of the Social Security Act for a project offering expanded partial hospitalization services. Evaluation will assess the project's impact on beneficiaries' health, Medicare savings from capitated payments, utilization of inpatient services, and associated costs. A report is due within 4 years. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress after 4 years, detailing findings, conclusions, and recommendations for legislation regarding additional mental health services provided by community mental health centers under partial hospitalization services and payment for such services on a capitated basis. The project will last for 3 years."
