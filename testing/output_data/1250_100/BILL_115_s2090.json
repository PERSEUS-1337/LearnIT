    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement Act of 2017 or the MEMA Act of 2017. It includes a National Flood Mapping Program. The Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement Act of 2017, also known as the MEMA Act of 2017, includes amendments to the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. These amendments involve incorporating building-specific flood risk information using current remote sensing technology and partnering with other federal agencies and private entities when appropriate. The MEMA Act of 2017 mandates the establishment of a digital display environment for flood hazard risk production within 5 years of enactment. The Administrator will work with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council and consult with states and communities to leverage successful approaches nationwide. The MEMA Act of 2017 requires the creation of a digital display for flood hazard risk information. The display will include special flood hazard areas, base flood elevations, and structure-specific flood risk data for lender compliance and property addresses. The curr_chunk provides details required for flood insurance, including the most current elevation certificate, letter of map changes, risk premium rate, and disclosure of premium rate differences. The curr_chunk details the estimated cost to repair structures damaged by floods with different recurrence intervals, the cost-effectiveness of mitigating structures using common methods, and how the premium rate would change based on each mitigation method. The curr_chunk discusses the development of a spatial database for buildings in the national flood insurance program, including privacy requirements for the database. The curr_chunk outlines the minimum requirements for a spatial database for buildings in the national flood insurance program, including LiDAR data, elevation certificates, parcel information, flood insurance rate maps, and other necessary data determined by the Administrator. The Administrator will obtain necessary data for the national flood insurance program, including directing communities to collect information for structures in flood hazard areas, issuing guidelines, partnering with stakeholders to share data. The Administrator will provide a 1-time premium credit for the purchase of an elevation certificate and issue guidelines for the adoption of LiDAR-based approaches in the National Flood Mapping Program. An annual progress report on the implementation of these measures will be submitted to the Senate and House committees. The Administrator may reimburse State or local agencies for assisting in carrying out responsibilities under the National Flood Insurance Act if they comply with established standards and guidance documents."
