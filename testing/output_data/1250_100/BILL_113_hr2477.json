    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. The \"Planning Actively for Cancer Treatment (PACT) Act of 2013\" aims to address the lack of shared decision-making and coordination in cancer care. It highlights the need for a comprehensive treatment plan, symptom management, and follow-up care for cancer survivors. The 1999 Institute of Medicine report highlighted disparities in cancer care for low-income individuals and ethnic minorities. Quality cancer care should include access to psychosocial services, symptom management, and shared decision-making for comprehensive care planning and follow-up. The Institute of Medicine report emphasizes the importance of quality cancer care, including initial treatment recommendations, treatment planning, access to resources and clinical trials, coordination of services, and psychosocial support for cancer survivors. The Institute of Medicine recommends providing cancer survivors with a comprehensive care summary and survivorship plan. They also emphasize the need for a plan that includes biomedical and psychosocial care as a standard for quality cancer care. Medicare should address cancer care inadequacies for elderly beneficiaries, as shortcomings in care relate to inadequate Medicare payments for planning and coordination services. Changes in Medicare payment for cancer care planning and coordination will support shared decision-making that reviews all treatment options and contribute to improved care for individuals with cancer from diagnosis to end of life. The Social Security Act is amended to include coverage for cancer care planning and coordination services, supporting shared decision-making for individuals with cancer from diagnosis to end of life. The term 'cancer care planning and coordination services' involves developing a treatment plan for individuals diagnosed with cancer, including assessing diagnosis, treatment needs, shared decision-making, comprehensive care details, and timely provision of care. The treatment plan for individuals diagnosed with cancer should be culturally and linguistically appropriate, in accordance with set standards, and revised as needed based on changes in the individual's condition, treatment preferences, or care elements. The development of a follow-up survivorship care plan for individuals who have completed primary cancer treatment includes assessing diagnosis, health status, treatment needs, engaging in shared decision-making, describing primary treatment elements, providing recommendations for subsequent care, and furnishing the plan within a specified period. The follow-up cancer care plan for individuals post-primary treatment should be culturally and linguistically accessible, meet appropriate standards, and be revised as needed for changes in condition, diagnosis, preferences, or care plan revisions. The Secretary will establish standards for revising cancer treatment plans and follow-up survivorship care plans in consultation with relevant organizations. This includes determining the need for revisions based on changes in the individual's condition and communicating the plan effectively. The shared decision-making process involves considering diagnosis, treatment options, medical evidence, risks, and benefits. The amendments to the Social Security Act involve payment rates for cancer care planning and coordination services under the physician fee schedule. The effective date for these changes will apply to services furnished after the first day of the first calendar year following the enactment of the Act."
