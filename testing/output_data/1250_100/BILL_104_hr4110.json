    "content": "The \"Children Health Insurance Act of 1996\" requires health insurance availability for children through amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes provisions for excise tax on failure to meet coverage requirements and definitions related to access to coverage. A tax is imposed on group health plans and insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements. The tax amount is 25 percent of premiums received for the plan year. Self-insured plans treat the cost of coverage as premiums. Insurers offering individual health insurance are also subject to the tax. The tax imposed on insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements is 25 percent of premiums paid for individual health insurance. The tax does not apply if the failure was not discovered despite reasonable diligence or if the failure is corrected within 30 days due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. The tax imposed on insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements can be waived if the failure is corrected within 30 days and was not due to willful neglect. The tax does not apply to governmental or church plans. The responsible parties for the tax are the group health plan or the insurer. The tax imposed on insurers offering health insurance coverage can be waived if the failure to meet coverage requirements is corrected within 30 days and was not due to willful neglect. The responsible party for the tax is the insurer. \"SEC. 9902.
