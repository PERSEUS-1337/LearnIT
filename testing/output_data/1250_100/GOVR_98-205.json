    "content": "The House and Senate approved FY1999 defense bills, signed into law on October 17. An omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 was approved, providing $8.3 billion in defense-related funding, signed into law on October 21. The President signed the annual defense appropriations bill (P.L. 105-277) on October 21, providing funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, weapons procurement, and research. The bill also includes funding for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. Congress approves annual defense-related appropriations, with the Administration's FY1999 budget including $270.6 billion for national defense. Congress acts annually on a national defense authorization bill, which addresses defense programs in detail. Differences between authorization and appropriations bills are minimal, with major defense policy debates usually occurring during authorization bill action. Congressional action on both measures was completed on October 1, with House and Senate 302(b) allocations approved in May. The Senate and House finalized their allocations for defense and other programs, slightly below the Administration's request. The House approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill, while the Senate Armed Services Committee worked on their version. See Table B-1 in Appendix B for defense discretionary fund allocations. The Senate completed marking up the FY1999 defense authorization bill, S. 2057, with floor action in May and June, passing the bill on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, with the President signing it into law on October 17. The House passed the FY1999 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 4103, on June 24, while the Senate passed its version on June 4. The full Senate considered the bill and passed it by substituting its text into H.R. 4103. The Senate passed H.R. 4103 on July 30, which was later signed into law as P.L. 105-262 on October 17. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill was approved by the House on September 28 and the Senate on September 29. The FY1999 congressional budget resolution was approved by the Senate on April 2 and the House on June 5, but a conference agreement was never completed. Supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved on April 30, providing funding for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, and other purposes. The bill (P.L. 105-174) provides $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including funding for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. Additionally, an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) approved $8.3 billion in defense-related funding for various purposes such as Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and defense antiterrorism activities. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) approved $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including funding for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. Additionally, $8.3 billion was allocated for defense-related purposes such as Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and defense antiterrorism activities. The bill also included emergency appropriations for defense and counter-drug activities, as well as rescissions of $67 million. Relations with China were a major issue during the conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills. The authorization conference dropped language banning satellite exports to China but included provisions transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certified not to harm U.S. space industry or China's missile capabilities. The agreement also prohibits port facility transfers to COSCO and includes an amendment condemning forced abortions in China. The appropriations conference agreement does not include measures regarding abortions, forced sterilization, or genital mutilation for visa denials. The agreement prohibits DOD from doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Base closures were not approved in the House or Senate authorization bills. The Senate dropped a provision that would make it difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a congressionally established base closure process. The House-passed bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate bill prohibited new policies until after a certain period. The Senate rejected a proposal to separate men and women in basic training, opting to continue current integrated practices with additional steps for separate sleeping quarters. The House-Senate conference adopted the Senate's language with a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. Both chambers rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House-passed bill included a measure to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons. The Senate-passed authorization bill included a provision allowing DOE to choose the long-term option of buying tritium for nuclear weapons. The conference agreement allows DOE to make the choice but prohibits implementation of any plan for a year. The House-passed authorization bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels. The House also provided a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel. The Senate approved a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements also included the 3.6% raise. Additionally, the Senate-passed defense appropriations bill provided $1.9 billion for Bosnia as emergency funding, while the House bill did not address this issue. The authorization bill included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with the option for additional funds to protect U.S. troops. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw troops by a specific date, but the Senate encouraged a drawdown of forces. The authorization allowed for emergency funding if needed for national security. Contentious weapons issues were minimal, with the Administration requesting one C-130J aircraft. The Administration requested just one C-130J aircraft and objected to additional funding for 7 more aircraft in the House bills. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provided funds for 7 aircraft, 6 more than requested. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure in May, with the authorization conference agreement cutting $294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cutting $376 million. Funding for the MEADS system was also reduced, with the authorization conference agreement cutting funding from $44 million to $24 million. The appropriations conference agreement provides limited funding for MEADS, ABL program funding reduced, increased funding for SBL R&D. Funding for new aircraft carrier development decreased due to Navy's decision. Advance procurement funds included for LHD-8 amphibious ship, criticized as pork barrel politics. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements allocated funds for new aircraft procurement, including F/A-18E/F and F-16 aircraft. The Administration objected to certain requirements in the Senate authorization bill, but the authorization conference included restrictions that could be waived. Some cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs were made to finance increases in other areas. Long-term weapons issues, such as B-2 bomber procurement and the New Attack Submarine program, were resolved. The House and Senate authorization bills addressed military health care for retirees, including pilot projects to test alternative approaches like joining the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The defense debate agenda also covered military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports, efficiency measures, military readiness, and long-term budget constraints. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress was constrained by budget agreements, leading to a \"zero-sum game\" where any additions to favored programs had to be offset by reductions in others. This marked a departure from past experiences and covered various issues such as military health care policy and Year 2000 computer problems. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress saw a sharp break from past years, with Congress adding $8.3 billion for defense programs at the end of the process. Budget constraints could have led to a confrontation over defense priorities, but senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on ongoing programs of interest. Key priorities included fully funding national missile defense development, increasing funding for National Guard and Reserve equipment, covering all defense health program costs, and advancing funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to FY2001. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress saw a break from past years, with Congress adding $8.3 billion for defense programs. Funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier was moved forward to FY2001 to avoid production gaps. The Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent reports influenced the congressional defense debate. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) released in December 1997 proposed a revised U.S. defense strategy, emphasized the need for efficiency to save money for weapons modernization, and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported much of the QDR but called for a greater focus on homeland defense and preparing for different types of threats in the future. The Panel argued for less emphasis on preparing for two major theater wars and more on future readiness, calling for increased spending on experimental force exercises and new technology. The Defense Department proposed two more rounds of military base closures, with Secretary Cohen making it a top priority for approval in 2001 and 2005. Previous base closure rounds are estimated to save about $5.6 billion annually starting in FY2000. The Defense Department projects annual savings of $2.8 billion from future base closure rounds. Resistance to base closures in Congress has been fueled by objections to the Administration's actions following the 1995 closure round, particularly the privatization plan for Air Force maintenance facilities in California and Texas. The Administration's plan for base closures has faced opposition from Members of Congress due to concerns about politicization. Secretary Cohen has suggested including a prohibition on privatization in future base closure legislation. Congress has not agreed to additional military base closures for FY1999. In FY1999, the House and Senate did not agree to additional military base closures. The Senate rejected a proposal for another base closure round in 2001. An amendment by Senator Inhofe to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a base closure process was approved by the Senate but later dropped. The Administration requested supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. The FY1999 defense budget requested $1.9 billion for extending the mission in Bosnia. Congress provided funding in H.R. 4328, with the Administration wanting it designated as \"emergency\" appropriations. This proposal was contentious as it broke precedent of including Bosnia costs in regular defense appropriations. The Administration argued that Bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached. Congress approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior congressional approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging the President to reduce U.S. troop levels in Bosnia, but rejected an amendment to cut off funds without congressional approval. The Senate added $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for Bosnia. The House included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without prior congressional approval, which the White House threatened to veto. The White House threatened a veto if the Skaggs provision for Bosnia was included in the appropriations bill. The authorization conference approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security. The appropriations conference did not include emergency funding for Bosnia, leaving it for later consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. Congressional focus shifted to relations with China, technology exports, and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. The House approved amendments to defense authorization. The House approved several amendments to the defense authorization bill to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, including limiting export of missile and satellite technology to China, transferring responsibility for reviewing technology exports to the State Department, and prohibiting the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. The White House objected to these measures. In the Senate, several China-related amendments were proposed, but debate on China policy was postponed. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer his amendments during the defense appropriations discussion. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer amendments during the defense appropriations discussion. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the bill due to concerns about contentious amendments on China. Ultimately, a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to officials involved in forced abortions passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement included provisions on technology exports to China, such as transferring review responsibility to the State Department and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. The President certifies that the export will not harm the U.S. spacelaunch industry or enhance China's missile launch capabilities. The conference agreement also bans transferring port facilities to COSCO. Efficiency measures recommended include reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cutting civilian and military support personnel, and pursuing public-private competitions for activities currently done by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce overhead activities and civilian personnel levels. Issues this year revolve around DOD cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel, Congress's potential for deeper cuts in overhead personnel, and reactions to privatization measures at local facilities. The House has pushed for significant reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have sought to soften these measures. HNSC urged DOD to comply with mandated cuts in acquisition personnel and imposed a $500 million cut in funding for consultants as a reform measure, which the White House objected to. The White House objected to cuts in consulting funds and measures in the House-passed authorization bill that would restrict DOD's efficiency. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds unless DOD meets requirements to cut headquarters staff and reduce Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Military readiness concerns include shortages in Air Force spare engines, Army recruit standards, personnel skill areas, and pilot retention rates. These issues are seen as signs of a looming readiness crisis due to inadequate funding and administration policies. The Clinton Administration's willingness to commit U.S. forces to more missions abroad than the force can support has raised concerns about military readiness. While some officials acknowledge problems, they argue that there is no overall crisis in readiness. Issues such as shortages in Air Force engine spares and pilot retention are being addressed through measures like higher reenlistment bonuses and limits on deployments. Army recruiting continues to meet quality standards. Officials have expressed concerns about personnel recruitment and retention, urging support for higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified about military readiness, identifying a need for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring funding for maintenance and providing limited additional amounts for readiness-related accounts. The Senate approved an amendment requiring reports on food stamp use. The Senate approved amendments to improve military readiness, including reports on food stamp use by military families and increased funding for troop benefits. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness but did not address changes to military retirement benefits. Concerns also exist about long-term funding for defense modernization programs. The Defense Department has had to reallocate funding from weapons procurement to operation and maintenance accounts for readiness. The FY1999 budget shows a slight decline in procurement funding due to adjustments in weapons programs. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, but achieving this goal without increasing overall defense spending is challenging. Efforts to reach the target involve applying efficiency savings from base closure and other measures. The Defense Department aims to reach a $60 billion procurement target by applying efficiency savings. However, challenges include potential delays due to increased weapons maintenance costs, unplanned expenses, and resistance to proposed personnel cuts in Congress. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 billion for BMD programs but no additional funds for weapons modernization. Active duty personnel reductions are part of efficiency savings mandated by the QDR, with some vocal opposition in Congress. The Administration requested active duty end-strength reduction by over 35,000 from FY1998 levels, with opposition in Congress to repealing statutory floors on end-strength. This poses challenges as active duty forces are already strained by contingency operations and forward presence abroad. The Army faces shortages in certain skills, exacerbating burdens during smaller-scale operations. Congress must agree to eliminate statutory floors to implement QDR reductions. The HNSC rejected the administration's request to repeal statutory floors on end-strength and agreed to reduce authorized end-strength by 11,000 positions. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The National Guard and Army National Guard are in dispute over combat unit roles. Congress approved special advisors for Guard and Reserve officers. The Defense Department requested more funding for Guard and reserve. The Defense Department has requested increased funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, while Congress has historically added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces. Disputes over major weapons programs, including Missile defense programs, are common in Congress. Increased funding for NMD programs is less contentious now. Major policy disputes remain, with the Administration pursuing NMD technology development but deferring deployment decisions. Missile defense advocates in Congress push for early nationwide defense deployment, questioning the relevance of the ABM Treaty. Disputes over TMD systems persist, focusing on THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS. Congressional action is ongoing. Congress has considered separate legislation for missile defense policy, with the Senate failing to pass \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998.\" The House approved additional funding for Theater Missile Defense programs in FY1998, and the FY1998 supplemental funding bill includes funding for TMD programs. The House-passed FY1999 authorization includes extra funding for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to test failures, restructuring the program and shifting funds. MEADS funding was cut and alternatives were to be studied. The Senate also reduced funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. The Senate appropriations bill cut funding for various missile defense programs, including $57 million from the Airborne Laser and $376 million from THAAD. They also increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D and added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. The agreement prohibits further MEADS expenditures until included in long-term defense budget plans. Additionally, the FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $1 billion for missile defense with unspecified allocation. The B-2 bomber procurement battle continues in Congress, with no additional funding allocated for more bombers. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production: the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter program. Funding has been requested for these programs in FY1999. The QDR studied three aircraft programs, including the F-22, F/A-18E/F, and JSF, and decided to continue all of them with reductions. Congressional actions included reducing F/A-18E/F procurement and imposing requirements for F-22 flight tests. The Senate rejected a proposal for more F-22 flight testing hours. The appropriations conference approved funding for 30 F-18s. In recent years, Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs, ensuring major shipyards have enough work to cover costs and maintain employment levels. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been moved up to FY2001 budget. The development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer is also a longer-term issue. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams for competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements to Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine. The Dynamics Electric Boat Division is designing different versions of the submarine. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new design for the CVX carrier, leading to questions about funding allocation for carrier R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing funding for CVX R&D and increasing funding for CVN-77 upgrades. Additionally, funds were allocated for a red team to study a futuristic aircraft carrier concept. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for the CVX aircraft carrier concept by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement provided $110 million for CVX R&D. Congress also addressed other weapons issues, such as funding for F-16 aircraft and the Joint Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft. Congressional action included adding funds for F-16 procurement and advance procurement for additional JSTARS aircraft. The House appropriations bill provided funding for various military equipment, including C-130 cargo aircraft and F-16s. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) allocated funds for JSTARS and additional C-130s, while the Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) funded more C-130s and Guard and Reserve procurement. There was debate over C-130J funding, with a proposal to reallocate funds for F/A-18E/F procurement and C-130 upgrades. The C-130J program funding was approved due to its proximity to the Speaker's district, at the expense of other programs like the F/A-18E/F. The National Defense Panel recommended focusing on advanced technologies instead of legacy programs like the Army M1A2 tank upgrade and Comanche helicopter. The appropriations conference agreement provided funds for C-130s, F-16, JSTARS, and Guard and Reserve equipment. The National Defense Panel criticized various military programs, including the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, and Comanche helicopter programs, as well as the Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F and F-22 programs. Congressional action included requiring a Quadrennial Defense Review and a review of the Army's Crusader artillery program. Social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training were also debated in defense funding bills. The Administration-appointed commission, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, made recommendations to improve recruitment and training in the military. One key recommendation was to provide separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training, a policy adopted by the Marine Corps. However, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with this recommendation. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, and none have altered their policies yet. Congressional action included a provision in the authorization bill for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training. The House and Senate were in disagreement over gender-integrated training in the military. The authorization conference agreement allowed current unit training practices to continue but required separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. Defense health care issues were also under discussion. Defense health care issues, including Tricare effectiveness and benefits for military retirees, have been a focus of recent discussions. Congress is evaluating Tricare and established a Medicare subvention demonstration program. HNSC and SASC took steps to ensure health care access for military retirees. The House approved testing military retirees' access to FEHBP. The authorization conference agreement includes demonstrations for providing health care to retirees through FEHBP enrollment, Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and Tricare pharmacy benefits. The defense appropriations bill earmarked funds for medical research and development programs, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Senate allocated $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, while the House included separate amounts for various medical programs. The appropriations conference agreement provided separate funds for medical programs, addressing issues such as Year 2000 computer problems. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and Treasury Department fix their computers for the Y2K problem. The House Republican caucus later decided not to provide the emergency funding, leading to its removal from the defense appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.1 billion for the Defense Department's Y2K conversion and an additional $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy and Department of Defense activities, with a key issue being tritium production for nuclear weapons programs. The House-passed bill prohibits DOE from buying tritium from commercial sources, leading to potential new facility costs. The Senate bill allows DOE to choose its preferred long-term option, creating a major issue in the authorization conference. The conference agreement allows DOE to choose its long-term tritium production option but delays implementation for Congress to review. Senator Kyl has objected to this provision, urging DOE to pursue a new tritium source. The House Budget Committee reported on budgetary levels for fiscal years 2000-2003. The Senate passed emergency supplemental appropriations for natural disasters and peacekeeping efforts for fiscal year 1998. The House passed a bill for emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1998. The Senate and House passed a bill (H.R. 3616) authorizing appropriations for military activities in fiscal year 1999. The bill went through committee markup, amendments, and a conference before being signed into law as P.L. 105-74 on May 1, 1998. The Senate passed bill S. 2057 authorizing appropriations for military activities in fiscal year 1999, which was signed into law as P.L. 105-261 on October 17, 1998. Another bill, S. 2132, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999, was also passed by the Senate. H.R. 4103, a bill for Department of Defense appropriations for FY1999, passed in lieu of S. 2132 after amendments. It went through House and Senate approval, with a conference agreement reached and signed into law as P.L. 105-262. H.R. 4328, an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999, also went through a similar process and was signed into law. The conference agreement for Defense Appropriations for FY1995 to FY1999 was approved by the Senate and signed into law as P.L. 105-277 on October 21, 1998. It included budget authority figures in billions of current year dollars and details on Ballistic Missile Defense Funding for FY1999 in millions of dollars. The Congressional Record from May 1998 provides details on Congressional action on major weapons programs for FY1999, including appropriations and authorization amounts in millions of dollars. Notes indicate exclusions of initial spares and military construction, as well as specific details on Sealift ship procurement and Ballistic Missile Defense funding. The National Defense Sealift Fund includes military construction requests of $17.2 million, often reported separately. Guard and Reserve Equipment amounts are not included in regular line items and do not cover C-130 aircraft. Emergency funding from the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) is excluded. Congressional actions on defense appropriations and authorizations for FY1999 are detailed in the Congressional Record. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other agencies. Five other appropriations bills also provide funds for national defense activities, including military construction and operation of military family housing. Total budget authority in billions of dollars is detailed by appropriations bill and title, with sources from Congressional Budget Office reports. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other agencies, including military construction and operation of military family housing. It is the largest of the defense-related appropriations measures. The national defense budget function also includes mandatory funding, with net mandatory funding for defense being relatively small. The FY1999 funding breakdown by appropriations subcommittee is provided in Table B-1. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected defense budgets through FY2002 reflect a budget agreement finalized in June 1997. National defense budget authority will grow slowly in nominal terms but remain flat when adjusted for inflation. By FY2003, budget authority will be almost 38% below the level in FY1985. Defense budget cuts in recent years have mainly reduced the size of the military. Defense budget cuts in recent years have reduced the military force size and slowed weapons modernization. The Quadrennial Defense Review aims to decrease active duty end-strength and procurement funding, with plans to increase funding by reducing defense civilian personnel levels. The FY1999 budget requests $48.7 billion for weapons procurement and $36.1 billion for research and development. The goal is to reach $61.3 billion for procurement by FY2001 through reforms in defense business practices. Congress has added substantial amounts to the annual defense budget request in recent years, but due to last year's budget agreement, there is no room to add to the FY1999 request. Table C2 shows congressional additions to the request in recent years. The United States Government's Fiscal Year 1999 budget includes adjustments for supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and technical adjustments. Key issues covered in CRS Issue Briefs include U.S. military operations in Bosnia, China-U.S. relations, Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, defense acquisition reform, F-22 and F/A-18E/F aircraft programs, military medical care services, and NATO expansion.
