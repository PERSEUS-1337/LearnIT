    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" and includes a numerical limitation to any single foreign state. The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act by adjusting numerical limitations for immigrant visas and making conforming amendments to sections related to immigrant visas. The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" adjusts immigrant visa numerical limitations and makes amendments to related sections. It includes provisions for the allocation of visa numbers to natives based on specific criteria and implements country-specific offsets. The effective date for these amendments is retroactively set to September 30, 2011, applying to fiscal years from 2012 onwards. The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" adjusts immigrant visa numerical limitations and implements country-specific offsets for fiscal years starting from 2012. For fiscal years 2012 and 2013, a percentage of immigrant visas will be allotted to natives of foreign states not among the top two states in terms of immigrant visa numbers. For fiscal year 2014, 10 percent of immigrant visas under the \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" will be allotted to natives of foreign states not among the top two states in terms of immigrant visa numbers in fiscal year 2012. Per-country visa levels restrict the number of visas for any single foreign state or dependent area to 25 percent or 2 percent of the total visas available. The provision outlines the allocation of immigrant visas for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, stating that not more than 85 percent of visas shall be allotted to immigrants from any single foreign state. A special rule allows unused visas to be issued if the total number available would otherwise not be issued. Rules for chargeability to determine the foreign state an alien is associated with are also specified. The House of Representatives passed the provision on November 29, 2011. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
