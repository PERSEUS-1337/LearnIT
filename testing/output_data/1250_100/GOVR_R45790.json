    "content": "The opioid epidemic in the United States involves the abuse of various types of opioids, including prescription pain medications like hydrocodone and illicit drugs like heroin. In 2017, an estimated 11.4 million people misused opioids, with 11.1 million misusing prescription pain relievers and 886,000 using heroin. In 2017, SAMHSA estimated that 3.2 million Americans were current \"misusers\" of prescription pain relievers and 494,000 were current users of heroin. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future Survey found that 3.4% of 12th graders used \"narcotics other than heroin\" in 2018. Opioid abuse can lead to various health issues, including nonfatal overdoses and death due to overdose. The number of drug overdose deaths has increased significantly, with opioids being involved in a majority of cases. Synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl, are driving the recent surge in overdose deaths. Addiction to opioids is a major concern, leading to various public health and social problems. The rates of overdose deaths vary by state, with states east of the Mississippi River having higher rates. The DEA plays a role in addressing the opioid crisis. The DEA and CDC report an increase in overdose deaths, especially in states with high fentanyl seizures. There is a strong link between synthetic opioid deaths and fentanyl reports. The number of fentanyl-related deaths may be underestimated due to lack of testing. Heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids are major drug threats in the US. High availability of controlled prescription drugs has decreased in recent years. The availability of heroin and illicit fentanyl has increased in recent years, with a rise in synthetic opioids in the US market. The abuse of prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone also increased significantly in the 1990s and early 2000s. Various measures have been taken by the federal government to combat unlawful prescription drug supply and abuse. The federal government has implemented measures to combat unlawful prescription drug supply and abuse, including grants for state prescription drug monitoring programs, crackdown on pill mills, increased regulation of internet pharmacies, reformulation of OxyContin, and rescheduling of hydrocodone. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention Act imposed tighter oversight on opioid production and distribution, required additional reporting and safeguards, and limited Medicare coverage of prescription opioids. In 2018, the DEA proposed a reduction in opioid manufacturing for 2019 due to a decline in prescriptions since 2014. The heroin supply trajectory differs from prescription opioids, with white powder heroin dominating the market in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The purity of heroin, particularly Mexican heroin, has increased over the years, with Mexican-sourced heroin dominating the U.S. market due to its proximity and reliable supply. Retail prices for heroin fell significantly in the 1990s and continued to decline through 2017, while Mexican transnational criminal organizations have increased production to meet the growing demand. Organizations have increased production of white powder heroin, especially in the eastern U.S., where it is the primary form consumed. Heroin sold in western states has also diversified. There is a growing concern over heroin seizures containing fentanyl and illicit nonpharmaceutical fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin. Illicit fentanyl largely comes from China and is often mixed with or sold as heroin. Law enforcement expects distributors to create new fentanyl products to evade regulations. The United Nations estimates that approximately 345,800 hectares of opium poppy crops were illicitly cultivated worldwide in 2018, with the majority grown in Afghanistan. Mexico, Burma, Laos, and Colombia also reported illicit cultivation. Synthetic opioids may enter the illicit drug market through diversion from legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. Illicit synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, are mostly sourced from foreign countries like China and India due to their large chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Clandestine labs producing fentanyl have been found in various countries, including Mexico, Canada, and the United States. The ingredients for prescription opioids can come from different countries, and they can be manufactured domestically or abroad. The majority of misused prescription opioids in the United States are prescribed for legitimate use and then diverted. Counterfeit opioids are also available, often pressed into pills in the US or abroad and sold. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are major suppliers of illegal drugs smuggled into the US, increasing their share of the heroin market. DEA suggests traffickers disguise opioids to gain new users. The Drug Threat Assessment highlights that most illicit heroin enters the US through the Southwest border, primarily through legal ports of entry in vehicles or trailers. In FY2018, 5,205 pounds of heroin were seized at ports of entry, while 568 pounds were seized between ports of entry. Fentanyl is smuggled into the US from China through various routes, with Mexican traffickers obtaining precursor chemicals from China. Traffickers obtain fentanyl precursor chemicals from China and smuggle fentanyl into the US. In FY2018, 1,785 pounds of fentanyl were seized at ports of entry, with the San Diego border sector being a primary entry point. The ONDCP is responsible for creating drug control policies and strategies to combat illicit opioid trafficking in the US. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) directs anti-drug efforts, manages grant programs like HIDTA, and focuses on countering opioid-related threats. The HIDTA program assists law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking areas to reduce drug production and trafficking through coordination, information sharing, and intelligence sharing. The HIDTA program provides funds to support drug trafficking initiatives in regions where heroin trafficking is a top priority. The ONDCP launched the Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) in 2015, which coordinates public health and public safety agencies to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt illicit opioid trafficking. The HRS also disseminates prevention activities and information on drug trafficking and use. The ONDCP collaborates with various agencies to combat opioid trafficking, including launching the Opioid Detection Challenge. DOJ controls the opioid supply through law enforcement and grants to agencies. The OCDETF program targets major drug trafficking organizations with the participation of multiple federal agencies. The federal agencies involved in combating drug trafficking include the FBI, ATF, U.S. Marshals, IRS, ICE, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, and DOJ's Criminal Division. They collaborate with state and local law enforcement on task forces and target organizations on the CPOT List. OCDETF strike forces and Fusion Center gather intelligence for operations, with 52% of investigations involving heroin in FY2018. The DEA enforces controlled substances laws nationwide with a 360 Strategy to address drug cartel violence and addiction issues. The 360 Strategy utilizes federal, state, and local law enforcement, diversion control, and community outreach to combat drug cartels, gangs, and opioid/heroin abuse. DEA employs community-based enforcement, task forces, and programs like HSP, HDMP, and FSPP to identify and address opioid trafficking, heroin sources, and fentanyl seizures. The FBI, along with other DOJ agencies like the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys, ATF, and U.S. Marshals, investigates and prosecutes individuals involved in opioid trafficking and distribution. The Office of Justice Programs administers grant programs to address the opioid epidemic. CBP administers grant programs to address opioid supply and demand, working to counter trafficking of illicit opioids along U.S. borders. They use tools like nonintrusive inspection equipment, canines, and screening systems to detect drugs. CBP seizes heroin and fentanyl at ports of entry and between them, with the Coast Guard also involved in drug interdiction. The Coast Guard is responsible for intercepting noncommercial maritime drug flows, primarily cocaine. They participate in multi-agency counterdrug task forces. USPIS, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service, has seen a significant increase in drug seizures, including opioids, in international and domestic parcels. The DEA regulates the flow of controlled substances in the United States, requiring registration and record-keeping for anyone handling these substances. They use criminal, civil, and administrative authorities to maintain a closed system with over 1.5 million registrants. The DEA uses various authorities to prevent drug diversion, including inspections, order form requirements, education, and establishing quotas for controlled substances. In 2018, the DEA lowered the production quota for opioids. Grant programs are available to address the opioid epidemic, with some focusing specifically on drug threats and criminal justice issues. These programs also target demand reduction, not just supply control. The DOJ grant programs COAP and Harold Rogers PDMP support projects related to opioid abuse, including diversion, collaboration between agencies, overdose outreach, prescription drug monitoring, interventions, and comprehensive strategies in response to the opioid epidemic. Law enforcement uses PDMP data to investigate illicit activities related to controlled substances, including physicians, pharmacists, and individuals involved in drug trafficking. The Anti-Heroin Task Force Program provides funding to state law enforcement agencies for heroin and opioid-related investigations. The Drug Courts Program enhances drug court services and substance abuse treatment. The Drug Courts Program provides resources to enhance drug court programs for nonviolent substance-abusing offenders, focusing on reducing recidivism and substance abuse through supervised treatment, drug testing, community supervision, sanctions, and rehabilitation services. The program also administers the Veterans Treatment Court Program to help veterans struggling with addiction, mental illness, and co-occurring disorders. Grants are awarded to establish and develop veterans treatment courts. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 authorized grants for programs for qualified veterans, including veterans treatment courts, peer-to-peer services, and treatment for incarcerated veterans. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention supports juvenile and family drug court programs focusing on substance abuse issues, especially related to opioid abuse or mental health disorders. The JAG program provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives at the state, local, and tribal levels. The JAG program funds various criminal justice initiatives in eight program areas, including law enforcement, prevention, drug treatment, and mental health programs. It also supports collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health systems to assist individuals with mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders. Grants encourage early intervention, training for professionals, and collaborative support services. The JJDPA authorizes OJJDP to provide grants for juvenile delinquency programs and improved justice systems. Grants can be used for various programs, including substance abuse prevention. Discretionary grants are also available for delinquency prevention programs for juveniles at risk of entering the justice system. The grants are broad enough to potentially be used for combating opioid abuse. The Opioid Affected Youth Initiative and RSAT Program are grant programs that support efforts to address challenges from opioid abuse impacting youth. The OJJDP administers the initiative, focusing on developing data-driven responses, while the BJA administers the RSAT Program for substance abuse treatment in correctional facilities. The Department of Justice provides grants to support reintegration services for offenders and tribal law enforcement needs, including anti-opioid activities. The U.S. has a multipronged foreign policy approach to combat illicit opioids. The U.S. government, primarily through the Department of State, engages with international organizations like the U.N. to address drug control issues, including opioids. This includes diplomatic engagement with entities such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the International Narcotics Control Board. The U.S. also works with the Organization of American States to combat opioid trafficking and promote cross-border information sharing. One objective is to incorporate new drugs and precursor chemicals into the international drug control regime. The U.S. government engages with international organizations like the U.N. to address drug control issues, including opioids. This includes advocating for the international control of key chemical precursors used in fentanyl production. The U.S. has also worked with the Universal Postal Union to combat opioid trafficking through international mail, but announced a withdrawal in 2018. Bilateral cooperation on opioids has included efforts in China, Mexico, and Canada through diplomatic dialogues, law enforcement cooperation, and foreign assistance programming. Bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics is a top priority for the United States with China and Mexico. Structured dialogues and law enforcement cooperation are key components, along with funding and programming to address opioids. Trilateral meetings with Canada also occur to address heroin and fentanyl issues. In China, INL funding supports drug-related information exchanges, training on synthetic opioids, and efforts for effective drug demand reduction. INL funds a Resident Legal Advisor in Beijing to work on amending China's legal framework for controlling fentanyl substances. In Mexico, U.S. cooperation focuses on disrupting drug production, dismantling distribution networks, prosecuting traffickers, and enhancing border security. Domestic actions target foreign opioid sources and traffickers through the U.S. criminal justice system. The U.S. government targets Chinese and Mexican nationals involved in opioid trafficking through legal indictments and financial sanctions. Recent actions include indictments against Chinese nationals for fentanyl production and sanctions against individuals and entities trafficking fentanyl. Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on counternarcotics efforts, including eradicating opium poppy, seizing opioids, and dismantling drug labs. The Mexican government also participates in international efforts to control precursor chemicals. In 2018, Mexico increased its budget for public security and formed an Office of National Drug Policy. President L\u00f3pez Obrador continues cooperation with the United States on drug control. The Mexican military leads efforts to eradicate illicit drug crops, including opium poppy. The United States has provided training and equipment to Mexican authorities for increased fentanyl seizures. In 2017 and 2018, Mexican agencies seized fentanyl and fentanyl-laced pills with U.S.-funded equipment. China is a primary source of illicit fentanyl for the United States. China imposed controls on fentanyl analogues, reducing their availability in the U.S. President Xi Jinping and President Trump supported further control of fentanyl substances in China. In April 2019, China announced all fentanyl-related substances would be added to the controlled list. China outlined steps to combat illicit fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking, including issuing guidance on handling criminal cases, investigating manufacturing bases, scrubbing drug-related content from the Internet, cutting off online communication for criminals, pressuring parcel delivery services to register senders' real names, increasing inspections of international parcels, setting up special teams for criminal investigations, sharing information with relevant countries like the United States, and developing technology for identifying controlled substances. China's government crackdown on illicit fentanyl includes eliminating traffickers' ability to alter compounds, but precursor chemicals may still flow to Mexico for production. China Post shares parcel data with USPS, assists DOJ investigations, and has targeted fentanyl rings. Congress has addressed opioid crisis with a public health approach and supply control laws. The 115th Congress addressed the opioid epidemic through the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), the 21st Century Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. These acts focused on opioid abuse prevention, treatment, and diversion control. Funding was provided in FY2017-FY2019 appropriations, with questions surrounding the amount allocated each year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided $347.0 million for comprehensive opioid abuse reduction activities. In FY2019, additional funding was allocated to the DEA to combat drug trafficking, including heroin and fentanyl. Other opioid-specific funding included initiatives for youth affected by opioids, improving tribal law enforcement, anti-heroin task forces, and resources for opioid detection and enforcement. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) received additional funding for personnel and research related to opioid/fentanyl investigations. ONDCP also received funding for Community-based Coalition Enhancement Grants to Address Local Drug Crises. It is challenging to track opioid funding due to various programs and purposes. States have adapted criminal justice elements to combat opioids. States have adapted criminal justice responses to address opioid-related issues, including increasing law enforcement access to naloxone to reduce overdose deaths. Over 2,400 police departments in 42 states reported officers carrying naloxone, with immunity provided to those who possess, dispense, or administer the drug. State and local law enforcement coordinate special operations to combat fentanyl and heroin trafficking, leading investigations to dismantle trafficking networks in areas with high opioid overdose rates. \"Good Samaritan\" laws have been enacted to encourage individuals to seek medical help for overdoses without fear of prosecution. Good Samaritan overdose immunity laws in 40 states and the District of Columbia prevent prosecution for illegal possession of controlled substances under certain circumstances. States have drug diversion programs and drug courts for offenders with substance abuse issues, particularly opioid abuse. The National Governors Association has supported efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, including expanding opioid addiction treatment in drug courts. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis recommended urging states to establish drug courts in every county. Several states have also passed legislation to increase access to treatment. In recent years, states have enacted legislation to increase access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for drug-addicted offenders in criminal justice settings. SAMHSA released guidance in March 2019 to help states expand MAT availability in these settings."
