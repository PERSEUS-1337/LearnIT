The district court must assess the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on claims presented in State courts, unless there was a failure to raise a claim due to State action violating the Constitution or laws of the United States. The district court must conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings to complete the record for habeas corpus review. Upon the development of a complete evidentiary record, the court will rule on the merits of the claims. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause does not apply to habeas corpus cases subject to this chapter, except for second or successive petitions."
