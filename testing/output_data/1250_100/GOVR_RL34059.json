    "content": "Congress is considering legislative strategies to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon dioxide uptake and storage. This is crucial to combat global climate change caused by human activities impacting the carbon cycle. Scientists agree that human perturbations to the carbon cycle are a main driver of climate change. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has risen by over 35% since the industrial revolution, now exceeding 380 ppm. Policy makers are exploring cap-and-trade systems to control emissions and maintain CO2 levels. The future uptake of carbon by forests and farmland, as well as the behavior of ocean and land surface carbon reservoirs, are active areas of scientific research. The report focuses on the human contribution of carbon to the atmosphere in the context of the global carbon cycle. CO2 is highlighted as the most important greenhouse gas released from human activities. Various reservoirs store carbon, including the atmosphere, oceans, vegetation, soils, and geological reservoirs. The atmosphere alone contains more carbon than all of Earth's living vegetation. The carbon in fossil fuels is linked to the atmosphere through extraction and combustion, unlike carbon in oceans, vegetation, and soils which are linked through natural processes like photosynthesis. Fossil fuel emissions globally impact the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, while natural carbon cycles constantly exchange carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, vegetation, and soils. Carbon from fossil fuels is transferred in a one-way direction from geologic storage within the time scale of human history. The carbon stored in fossil fuels is only a source of carbon for the atmosphere, unlike oceans, vegetation, and soils which can act as both sinks and sources of carbon. The constant exchange between these storage pools and the atmosphere impacts the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Vegetation, for example, acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon during spring and summer but becomes a source in fall and winter. Fossil carbon is only a source of carbon and not a sink, except over geologic time scales. The global carbon cycle involves exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Human activities contribute around 9 GtC of CO2 to the atmosphere annually, tipping the balance and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels by approximately 100 ppm since 1750. This rapid addition of CO2 is disrupting the natural balance of carbon flux in the environment. The rapid addition of CO2 to the atmosphere has disrupted the natural balance of carbon flux. Despite the oceans and land surface absorbing more CO2 than they release, atmospheric concentrations continue to rise. About 45% of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use activities remains in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing and potential planet warming. The oceans and land act as sinks for CO2, but continued emissions may lead to further atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. Carbon sinks, such as the land surface, absorb more CO2 than they emit, acting as a net sink for CO2. Climate change may affect the balance between sources and sinks, leading to uncertainties in the effectiveness of land use practices for carbon sequestration. The behavior of carbon sinks in the future is a significant concern for scientists and policymakers. Tropical deforestation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, releasing 1.6 GtC per year in the 1990s. Despite this, net forest regrowth in some regions acts as a global net sink of approximately 1 GtC per year. The term \"residual land sink\" is now preferred over \"missing sink\" to describe the terrestrial ecosystem's role in absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. The \"residual land sink\" is the leftover part of the global carbon cycle calculation after accounting for various components like fossil fuel emissions, land-use emissions, atmospheric increase, and ocean uptake. The mechanisms responsible for this residual sink, such as the fertilizing effect of increased CO2 concentrations on plant growth, are not well understood. While models predict enhanced growth and carbon sequestration in response to rising CO2 levels, long-term observations suggest that fertilization effects may not account for the residual land sink, especially in the United States. In North America, particularly the United States, approximately 0.5 GtC per year accumulates in terrestrial sinks, making up a significant portion of the global terrestrial carbon sink. The North American terrestrial carbon sink, including regrowth of forests on abandoned farmland and woody encroachment on former grazing lands, accounts for a large fraction of the global terrestrial carbon sink. Other smaller carbon sinks in North America, such as wood products and wetlands, also play a role in carbon accumulation. The oceans act as a net sink for carbon, storing more than the land surface and potentially storing over 90% of carbon released by human activities. The oceans store over 90% of carbon released by human activities, but the process is slow. CO2 entering the oceans increases acidity, impacting marine life. Ocean mixing and transport of CO2 to deeper waters affect the effectiveness of the ocean sink for CO2. The effectiveness of the ocean sink for CO2 is influenced by the transport of CO2 from the surface to the ocean depths. The Southern Ocean plays a significant role in absorbing anthropogenic carbon, but its capacity may be weakening. Legislative strategies are being explored to address the human impact on the global carbon cycle, with uncertainties about the future behavior of ocean and land surface sinks. The future behavior of the terrestrial carbon sink is uncertain, with potential for current sinks to become sources of carbon due to factors like melting permafrost and severe wildfires. Policy makers need to evaluate and quantify management strategies to address this issue. Policy makers must assess management practices like afforestation and conservation tillage to increase carbon flux from the atmosphere to land. Land management practices may qualify for carbon offsets in cap-and-trade legislation. The future behavior of the ocean sink, especially the Southern Ocean, is crucial for the net ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux. Techniques like iron fertilization and deep ocean CO2 injection for ocean carbon sequestration have unknown long-term environmental impacts. The uncertainty in future carbon sinks behavior makes it difficult to accurately predict atmospheric CO2 concentrations, even with controlled emissions. Changes in carbon uptake or release from oceans, soils, and vegetation could impact predictions. Policy makers aiming to keep CO2 concentrations below specific thresholds may need to understand the factors affecting carbon uptake and release on land and in oceans."
