    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and reliance on coal as the most abundant fossil energy resource are highlighted. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21% over the past 30 years. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21 percent. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance from electricity generating facilities would allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50 percent. However, the initial commercial deployment of these technologies carries significant risks in a competitive electricity market. Continued research and development towards near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important and desirable. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to those established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary is required to assess cost and performance goals for technologies enabling the competitive use of coal for electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various industry representatives and agencies is mandated in establishing these goals. The Secretary must issue draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of enactment of the Act, and submit final goals to Congress within 180 days after considering public feedback. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving specific goals. Recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities will also be included. Develop recommendations for additional authorities needed to achieve cost and performance goals, giving weight to expert advice from relevant entities. The Secretary will conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies to achieve cost and performance goals under various Acts. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This funding is in addition to existing authorizations and does not limit Department of Energy fossil energy research and development. Additionally, the Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative is established. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. A plan outlining program elements, management structure, and technical milestones must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The plan includes advanced coal-based technologies for electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts, aiming for efficiency improvements and enhanced environmental performance. The plan aims to recycle coal combustion wastes and capture carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include demonstrating efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include demonstrating efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. The emissions standards include limits on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter based on heat input levels. Financial assistance will be provided by the Secretary to projects that demonstrate cost reductions in utilizing coal for energy generation. This assistance aims to support projects that achieve specified performance levels, including efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. Additionally, projects that produce coal combustion byproducts with higher economic value and no increase in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide will also be supported. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to projects demonstrating cost reductions in utilizing coal for energy generation. The assistance aims to support projects achieving specified performance levels, including efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. The Federal share of project costs funded under this section shall not exceed 50 percent. $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2012 for this purpose. The Secretary can use unobligated funds for fossil energy programs or funds from clean coal technology projects that are no longer obligated. Appropriations for a fiscal year will be reduced by the amount used from these funds."
