    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring transportation services from private contractors to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness. The Act defines key terms such as architectural, engineering, and related services, private contract, government agency, Secretary, and surface transportation project. A \"transportation project\" is a project eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, a capital project, and any other project related to surface transportation as determined appropriate by the Secretary. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and onwards, Federal funds can be used for surface transportation projects to enter into private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services if a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. The analysis must include a description of services, cost estimates for the contract, negotiation, inspection, and comparison to in-house performance costs. The government agency must conduct a cost-benefit analysis before entering into private contracts for services. This analysis includes determining if services would be procured more quickly through a private contract, estimating equipment and material costs, estimating unemployment compensation for displaced employees, and estimating the cost of resuming in-house performance. The government agency is resuming the performance of services under a private contract. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. Government agencies must disclose cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts before entering into them. Results must be reviewed by the Secretary, shared with registered individuals/entities, and made publicly available. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nWithin 15 days of a government agency publishing the results of a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract, employees and interested parties can submit written comments disputing the accuracy of the results. Additionally, agency employees can submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract.\n\nSEC. 7. USE OF QUALIFICATION-BASED SELECTION CRITERIA.\n\nWhen procuring architectural, engineering, and related services for surface transportation projects using Federal funds, government agencies must follow specific procedures outlined in title 40, United States Code, or equivalent State qualifications-based requirements.\n\nSEC. 8. SPECIALTY, EMERGENCY, TEMPORARY WORK. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is emergency, specialty, or temporary in nature and cannot be performed by government employees to avoid underutilization."
