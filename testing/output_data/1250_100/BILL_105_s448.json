    "content": "The Act titled \"Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act\" addresses the interstate transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. It introduces a new section, SEC. 4011, to regulate this aspect. The \"Local Government Interstate Waste Control Act\" prohibits out-of-state municipal solid waste disposal in landfills or incinerators without local government authorization. The authorization must be granted formally, recorded in writing, and final. The local government must require the owner or operator of a facility to provide detailed information, including a description of the facility, waste quantities, and a map of the facility site. This information must be made available for inspection by the Governor, adjoining local governments, Indian tribes, and interested parties. The owner or operator of a facility must provide detailed information on environmental characteristics, controls, waste residuals, and site access controls. The owner or operator of a facility must provide information on site access controls, roadway improvements, required permits, personnel requirements, and any violations of environmental laws. Prior to formal action on granting authorization for out-of-State municipal solid waste, affected local governments must notify relevant parties and publish notice of the action. Additionally, the owner or operator must provide information on gifts, contributions, compliance with state waste management plans, and enforcement proceedings. The local government must publish notice of the proposed action and provide an opportunity for public comment, including a public hearing. They must also notify the Governor, adjoining local governments, and any adjoining Indian tribes of the authorization granted. Limitations apply to landfills and incinerators in operation or under construction. Before authorizing the acceptance of out-of-State municipal solid waste, the owner or operator must have received documented shipments or obtained legal authorization from the local government. Landfills must comply with design, location, monitoring, and financial assurance laws, while incinerators must also meet regulatory standards. The incinerator must comply with Clean Air Act requirements and state laws. Documentation of municipal solid waste shipments is required. Governors have the authority to restrict out-of-state waste disposal at landfills based on local government and solid waste planning unit requests. A Governor may limit out-of-State municipal solid waste disposal at a landfill to the previous year's quantity if a local solid waste planning unit exists. The landfill must be in the State and exempt from certain requirements. Requests to limit waste disposal must follow procedural requirements. The affected local government and solid waste planning unit must provide notice, allow public comment, and take formal action before submitting a request to limit out-of-State municipal solid waste disposal. The Governor must respond consistently without discrimination based on landfill or waste origin. The Governor cannot use the authority granted if it conflicts with State law or violates existing contracts for out-of-State waste disposal. Existing agreements are not affected by this section, and landfill operators must make disposal contracts available for public inspection. The owner or operator of a landfill or incinerator must provide a copy of the disposal contract for out-of-State municipal solid waste, with key details visible. States can choose to be exempt from this requirement by notifying the Administrator. The Administrator will acknowledge a State's exemption from certain requirements upon notification. Definitions include 'affected local government' as elected officials with jurisdiction over landfill areas, 'affected local solid waste planning unit' as a political subdivision managing waste planning, and 'host agreement' as a binding contract between landfill operators and local governments. The term 'municipal solid waste' refers to solid waste generated by the general public or from various sources, excluding hazardous waste, industrial waste, medical waste, and recyclable materials. The term 'out-of-State municipal solid waste' refers to waste generated outside of a specific state. The term 'owner or operator' excludes state or local governments that own or operate landfills or incinerators within their jurisdiction. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new item in the table of contents related to waste generated by a person who owns or operates a facility. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new section on interstate transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste."
