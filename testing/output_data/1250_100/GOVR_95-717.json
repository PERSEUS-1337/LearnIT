    "content": "The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows tort suits to be brought against the United States by waiving sovereign immunity for some tort suits. Congress has the power to waive or qualify immunity, making the US liable for the negligent acts of its employees under certain circumstances. The FTCA allows tort suits against the United States, but there are exceptions where the US may not be held liable, such as the Feres doctrine, discretionary function exception, and intentional tort exception. Other exceptions include strict liability, interest prior to judgment, punitive damages, acts under an invalid statute, postal matters, tax or customs duties, and fiscal causes. Claims under the FTCA must be presented to the relevant federal agency within two years of the claim accruing. If the agency denies the claim within six months, the claimant has six months to file suit in federal court. If a federal employee is sued for a tort committed within their scope of employment, the United States will be substituted as the defendant in federal court. The district court will dismiss the suit against the United States if the plaintiff fails to present a claim to the appropriate federal agency. The claimant must file the claim with the agency within 60 days after the dismissal of the suit, if they had sued the federal employee within two years of the injury. Suits under the FTCA are tried without a jury, and settlements over $25,000 require approval from the Attorney General or his designee. United States attorneys can settle claims up to $1 million. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows for settlements up to $1 million, with smaller settlements paid by the agency and larger settlements from general revenues. Attorneys representing claimants cannot charge more than 25% of a court award or 20% of a settlement. The Westfall Act makes FTCA the exclusive remedy for torts by federal employees, granting immunity from state tort law liability. Federal employees are immune from liability under state tort law, but can still be sued for violating the Constitution or federal statutes. The Westfall Act grants immunity even when an FTCA exception precludes recovery against the United States. If a federal employee is sued under state tort law, the Attorney General can certify that the employee was acting within the scope of employment, substituting the United States for the employee. The Attorney General can certify that a federal employee was acting within the scope of employment, substituting the United States as a defendant in the action. If the certification is refused, the employee can petition the court for certification. The Supreme Court has addressed the certification provisions in two cases. In the case of Westfall v. White, 515 U.S. 417 (1995), the Supreme Court ruled that the Attorney General's certification of a federal employee's scope of employment is reviewable in court. This certification allows the United States to be substituted as the defendant in a tort action under the FTCA. If the employee was found to be acting outside the scope of employment, the plaintiffs' tort action could proceed against him. The lower court initially held the certification as unreviewable, but the Supreme Court reversed this decision. In Osborn v. Haley, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision that the Attorney General's certification of a federal employee's scope of employment is proper and that the United States must remain as a substitute defendant unless proven otherwise by the District Court. The Supreme Court held that once the Attorney General certifies a case for removal from state court to federal district court, the federal district court must retain jurisdiction and cannot remand, as per 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). This decision conflicted with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which bars appellate review of remanding a case to state court. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the FTCA does not explicitly exclude injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service, but such exclusion is implied to fit into the statutory scheme of remedies against the Government. The Court found that prohibiting recovery for service-connected injuries aligns with the act's limitation of making the United States liable only \"to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" This is because no American law allows a soldier to recover for negligence against their superiors or the Government, as no private individual has the authority to conscript or mobilize a private army. The Supreme Court's decision in Feres was influenced by the fact that the FTCA does not allow recovery for injuries incident to military service, as no private individual has the authority to conscript or mobilize a private army. Congress also did not provide for how recovery under the FTCA would affect entitlement to compensation for injuries or death of those in the armed services. The Feres doctrine governs the relationship between military personnel and the Government, exclusively under federal law. Congress did not intend to create a new cause of action dependent on local law for service-connected injuries or death due to negligence. The Supreme Court identified three rationales for the Feres doctrine, emphasizing the distinctively federal nature of the Government's relationship with its Armed Forces and the establishment of a statutory compensation scheme for injured servicemen. The Feres doctrine, established in United States v. Brown and reaffirmed in United States v. Shearer, is based on the special relationship between soldiers and their superiors, the impact on discipline, and the potential consequences of allowing suits for negligent acts during military duty. Each case must be considered individually within the framework of the doctrine. The Feres doctrine, established in United States v. Brown and reaffirmed in subsequent cases, emphasizes factors like second-guessing military decisions and potential impairment of military discipline in determining if a suit is barred. Other factors mentioned in Feres are no longer controlling. In Atkinson v. United States, a medical malpractice suit under the FTCA was allowed for injuries \"incident to service\" in an Army hospital. The Ninth Circuit panel granted a rehearing after the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Johnson reaffirmed these factors. The Ninth Circuit panel granted a rehearing in Atkinson, reversing its decision due to negligence by Army hospital personnel causing a stillborn child. The panel emphasized that the Feres doctrine only bars suits when military decisions are questioned or military discipline is at risk. The Supreme Court confirmed a case-by-case approach to claims of immunity in Shearer. Atkinson was not under military compulsion or performing military duties, with no command relationship with her physician. The Feres doctrine does not apply to medical treatment in non-field hospitals for a woman seeking to have a healthy baby. The court allows for case-by-case consideration of military malpractice suits. In United States v. Johnson, the Supreme Court held that the Feres doctrine bars suits for military personnel injured incident to service, even in cases involving civilian agency employees. The Supreme Court reexamined and reaffirmed the Feres doctrine in a case involving a helicopter crash allegedly caused by FAA negligence. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the doctrine is not in the FTCA and was wrongly decided. The Ninth Circuit reversed itself in a subsequent case, citing the Court's approval of all three rationales associated with Feres. The Court reaffirmed the Feres doctrine, endorsing all three rationales. Johnson revived the first two rationales, supporting the doctrine's application. Del Rio v. United States upheld Feres, barring a servicewoman's malpractice suit for negligent prenatal care. In Irvin v. United States, a servicewoman alleged negligent prenatal care by the military resulting in her infant's death, but the Feres doctrine barred suit. Bowers v. United States held that Feres precludes recovery for medical malpractice at a pre-induction physical, even if the plaintiff was not a service member at the time. The court found that a decision for the plaintiff would directly affect military judgments and decisions. The Feres doctrine stands with no exception for medical malpractice cases, potentially changing with action from the Supreme Court or Congress. Some Members have shown interest in amending the doctrine to allow medical malpractice suits. The Feres doctrine does not allow medical malpractice cases, but there is interest in amending it. The Carmelo Rodriguez Military Medical Accountability Act of 2009 was introduced in the 111th Congress to amend the FTCA for claims by military members against the US for injuries from improper medical care. The discretionary function exception in the FTCA protects the US from liability for discretionary actions by federal employees. The discretionary function exception in the FTCA protects the US from liability for discretionary actions by federal employees, as established in Dalehite v. United States and United States v. Varig Airlines. The Supreme Court held that FAA employees conducting compliance reviews are protected by the discretionary function exception in the FTCA. In Berkovitz v. United States, it was established that the government could be held liable if federal employees failed to follow specific regulations. The Berkovitz case involved a baby who got polio from a vaccine, claiming violations by the Division of Biologic Standards and the Bureau of Biologics. The regulatory scheme required thorough examination before licensing a product, but the agency was accused of not following safety standards for vaccine lots. The Berkovitz case involved a baby contracting polio from a vaccine due to violations by the Division of Biologic Standards and the Bureau of Biologics. Plaintiffs alleged that employees knowingly approved a lot that did not comply with safety standards, leading to a trial where the discretionary function exception was questioned. The Court rejected the notion that the exception exempts the United States from claims based on non-discretionary operational level acts. In United States v. Gaubert, the Court held that the discretionary function exception barred a suit against the United States for the activities of federal bank regulators in connection with a failing savings and loan association. In United States v. Gaubert, federal bank regulators were involved in the day-to-day business of a failing savings and loan association, advising on operational and financial matters, bankruptcy decisions, salary disputes, litigation complaints, charter conversion, and intervention with supervisory agents. The plaintiff alleged negligence in these activities, leading to $100 million in damages. The court debated whether the discretionary function exception applied, protecting policy decisions but not operational actions. The Supreme Court disagreed, defining discretionary acts as those involving choice or judgment. The discretionary function exception applies to decisions based on policy or planning functions, as well as operational decisions. The intentional tort exception excludes claims for certain torts, but allows liability for some if committed by federal law enforcement officers. In Sheridan v. United States, naval corpsmen failed to alert authorities about an armed and intoxicated man who later caused harm. The intentional tort exception prevented the plaintiffs from suing the government for the man's actions, so they sued based on the corpsmen's negligence. The government argued that the intentional tort exception applied, but the Supreme Court did not rule on this argument. The Supreme Court ruled in Sheridan v. United States that the intentional tort exception did not apply to bar a suit based on the negligence of off-duty servicemen. The government could not be held liable for the intentional or negligent acts of federal employees not acting within the scope of their office or employment. This interpretation was based on the Federal Tort Claims Act, which only holds the government liable for torts committed by employees within the scope of their duties. The Supreme Court ruled in Sheridan v. United States that the intentional tort exception did not apply to bar a suit based on the negligence of federal employees. The Court also discussed the availability of a \"government contractor defense\" in certain cases involving design defects in products liability cases under state law. In product liability cases alleging design defects, the government contractor defense may be used by manufacturers who argue they followed government contract specifications. The Supreme Court in Boyle held that federal common law allows this defense in certain cases to avoid conflicts with federal policies or interests. The government contractor defense can be used in product liability cases to avoid conflicts with federal policies. In Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., the Supreme Court allowed this defense when a state-imposed duty of care conflicts with a federal contract. The defense may not apply if the duty of care does not conflict with the contract or if the design defect was not specifically ordered by the government. The Supreme Court did not adopt the Feres doctrine for the government contractor defense in product liability cases. Instead, the Court found that the discretionary function exception provided a better basis for the defense, stating that the selection of appropriate design for military equipment is a discretionary function. This defense can be used to avoid conflicts with federal policies when a state-imposed duty of care conflicts with a federal contract. The Supreme Court ruled that state law holding government contractors liable for design defects in military equipment can conflict with federal policy. Liability cannot be imposed if the United States approved precise specifications, the equipment met those specifications, and the supplier warned about known dangers. This ensures the discretionary function exception is not frustrated. The government contractor defense can apply to both civilian and military contractors, rooted in considerations peculiar to the military. In Nielson v. George Diamond Vogel Paint Co., the court acknowledged the defense can apply to civilian equipment but found no reason to apply it in that case. In Hercules, Inc. v. United States, the Supreme Court rejected a claim by Agent Orange manufacturers for reimbursement from the government for defending and settling tort claims brought by Vietnam veterans. The manufacturers alleged an implied agreement with the government to reimburse them for tort liability, but the court found no reason to apply the government contractor defense in this case. The Court in Hercules, Inc. v. United States rejected a claim by Agent Orange manufacturers for reimbursement for tort liability and breach of contractual warranty. The government does not warrant third-party claims against contractors. Federal law limits recovery for military and civilian personnel injured during atomic weapons tests. The Feres doctrine bars military personnel from suing the United States, but not their spouses or children for their own injuries. The Feres doctrine bars a suit by a serviceman's next of kin for damages resulting from the death or injuries if incident to service. It distinguishes between recoverable injuries caused directly by the military and those resulting from a service-connected injury. Courts have held that the doctrine prevents spouses from recovering for injuries caused by soldiers being ordered into nuclear blast areas or children born with birth defects from genetic changes in their fathers due to radiation exposure. However, the doctrine does not prevent actions against the United States for service-related injuries resulting from post-service negligence. The Feres doctrine does not bar suit by the daughter and grandson of a soldier exposed to radiation. Civilians have also been denied recovery for injuries from atomic testing due to the discretionary function exception. The Supreme Court has not ruled on this exception in atomic testing cases, but lower courts have held that it bars recovery. The plaintiffs in In re Consolidated argued that government negligence in following safety guidelines during atomic testing resulted in overexposure of test participants. The Ninth Circuit held that safety decisions were part of policy decisions and fell within the discretion of the government. The plaintiffs also claimed negligence in failing to warn or monitor participants for health problems. The court held that the decision not to warn test participants of radiation exposure risks fell under the discretionary function exception, requiring difficult judgments and balancing of risks. This involved a commitment of resources and high-level government discretion. In Allen v. United States, the court concluded that the government's failure to fully monitor offsite fallout exposure and provide public information on radioactive fallout fell under the discretionary function exception. The court emphasized that the government had a broad and discretionary duty to promote safety, leaving it up to the AEC to decide how to protect public safety. No evidence was presented that the AEC or its employees violated specific statutory or regulatory authority. Plaintiffs' case against the government rests on the argument that better plans could have been made, but this is not sufficient for FTCA liability. Victims of atomic testing are unable to sue government contractors due to federal law, which provides that FTCA is the exclusive remedy for injuries related to radiation exposure from atomic weapons testing programs. The Warner Amendment makes suits against the United States under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for claims based on atomic testing injuries. The constitutionality of the Warner Amendment has been upheld by two federal courts of appeals. Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990, providing compensation for victims of atomic testing and uranium mining. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 provides compensation for individuals who contracted certain cancers or diseases due to exposure to radiation from atomic testing or uranium mining. Claimants do not need to prove that radiation exposure caused their illness. Accepting compensation forfeits the right to sue the government or federal contractors for related claims. The act was influenced by the Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act of 1988. Department of Justice regulations for the act can be found at 28 C.F.R. Part 79. Before discussing federal employees' immunity from liability for constitutional torts, it is important to address their liability for such torts. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, federal agents entered and searched the plaintiff's apartment without a warrant, leading to a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. While state officials can be sued under state tort law and \u00a7 1983 for constitutional torts, federal officials are not liable under state tort law due to the Westfall Act. However, the Supreme Court ruled in Bivens and subsequent cases that injured parties can still seek damages from federal officials for constitutional torts, even without a specific statute. The Supreme Court ruled in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents that injured parties can seek damages from federal officials for constitutional torts. However, in cases like Chappell v. Wallace and United States v. Stanley, special factors may prevent the availability of such remedies. The Supreme Court ruled in Chappell v. Wallace and United States v. Stanley that special factors may prevent injured parties from seeking damages from federal officials for constitutional torts. The plaintiff's claim against the government was barred by Feres, and his claim against the officers involved was barred by Chappell. The plaintiff argued that the officers in this case were not his superior military officers, but the Court found that the issue of service incidence had already been decided against him. While Chappell may not be strictly controlling, the Court emphasized that military chain-of-command concerns were still relevant. The Court emphasized that military chain-of-command concerns were still relevant in cases involving injuries incurred incident to service as a result of constitutional torts. The Feres doctrine applies to preclude military personnel from suing the government under the FTCA or federal officials under Bivens, as established in Chappell v. Wallace and United States v. Stanley. Additionally, Bivens-type actions are not permitted when Congress has provided an alternative remedy viewed as equally effective. The Court in Carlson v. Green allowed a Bivens-type action against a federal prison official for violating the Eighth Amendment. Congress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel causes of action. The Supreme Court has limited the availability of Bivens actions in subsequent cases. The Supreme Court has limited the availability of Bivens actions in cases involving private entities acting under color of federal law. In Wilkie v. Robbins, the Court explained the two-step process for determining whether a Bivens remedy is appropriate. In Wilkie v. Robbins, the Supreme Court declined to allow a Bivens action for damages sought from officials of the Bureau of Land Management, citing difficulties in identifying illegitimate pressure and the potential for an onslaught of Bivens actions. The Court also clarified that Bivens liability cannot be established solely on a theory of respondeat superior. The Bivens decision has been criticized for being progovernment, with very few successful damages recoveries for plaintiffs. Out of 12,000 Bivens claims filed between 1971 and 1985, only four cases resulted in judgments not reversed on appeal. Recoveries from settlements and litigated judgments remain rare, with plaintiffs obtaining damages in less than one percent of cases. This raises questions about federal employees' common law immunity from liability for constitutional torts. The FTCA grants federal employees immunity from state tort law, but only qualified immunity from constitutional tort actions. In Butz v. Economou, the Supreme Court ruled that federal executive officials have qualified immunity, subject to exceptional cases where absolute immunity is necessary. State executive officers are immune from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 based on the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the office at the time of the action. The Scheuer standard provides qualified immunity for executive officers acting in good faith during official conduct, granting immunity from liability for violating constitutional rights under the discretionary function exception of the FTCA. Congress has the authority to grant additional immunity to federal officials."
