    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East, including historical aid levels, specific country programs, and current issues. Congress authorizes and oversees aid programs, with the Middle East being a major recipient. Data sources include USAID's Greenbook, appropriations data, and executive branch notifications. U.S. foreign aid in the region aims to advance core interests, such as support for Israel and peaceful relations. U.S. foreign assistance in the Middle East supports Israel, promotes peace treaties, and fights terrorism. Aid also aims to achieve a two-state solution between Palestinians and Israel, prevent aid diversion to terrorist groups, and counter Iranian influence in Iraq and Lebanon. Recent challenges include civil wars, political conflict, and economic weakening in countries like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen. Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen are facing civil wars and terrorist violence, threatening central governance and neighboring states. Local affiliates of Al Qaeda or ISIS are engaged in battles that could reshape the Middle East map. Tunisia is making progress towards democracy, but its stability is fragile due to economic weakness and ongoing terrorism. Congressional debates continue on the level of U.S. resources needed for the region. Bilateral aid to countries like Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians has remained consistent, reflecting strong Congressional support for Israel and regional peace efforts. Since FY2012, Congress and the Administration have allocated over $4 billion for the humanitarian response to the Syrian refugee crisis and authorized new funding for security assistance in the region to counter the Islamic State. This funding has come from new appropriations or reprogramming from Defense Department accounts. The conflicts in Syria and Iraq receive a significant portion of regional foreign assistance, including humanitarian spending, military aid, and support for neighboring states like Lebanon and Jordan. The Administration is seeking $3.45 billion in combined State Department and Defense Department funding for FY2016 to address these conflicts. Future appropriations may be influenced by domestic budgetary constraints, with funding for State Department operations remaining relatively flat since FY2009. Lawmakers have relied on Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for foreign aid, which are not subject to budget caps. Recent aid to Iraq, the Syrian opposition, and Jordan has been designated as OCO, along with funding for humanitarian crises. The House version of the State Department funding bill would provide $47.8 billion in total funding. Grant assistance and loan guarantees have been provided to non-oil producers in the region to address financial needs. The IMF has provided loans to Morocco and Tunisia. The IMF has provided loans to Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Yemen totaling over $9 billion, with conditions for economic reforms. Arab Gulf states have increased aid to the Middle East to counter Islamist influence. Iran also provides assistance to allies in the region. The Administration has requested $7.14 billion in non-humanitarian aid for Near East and North Africa countries for FY2016. The FY2016 foreign affairs budget request includes a $365.1 million increase (+5.4%) over FY2014 funding levels, with over 80% allocated to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank/Gaza. Non-humanitarian aid to Middle Eastern countries includes various budget accounts like Development Assistance, Economic Support Fund, and Foreign Military Financing. Emergency humanitarian aid is also included in the request. The FY2016 foreign affairs budget request includes $873.4 million for Middle Eastern bilateral aid and $1.63 billion for humanitarian aid for the crisis in Syria and Iraq, making up one-third of all OCO funds sought for FY2016. The Administration is also requesting $40 million in ESF funding for the Middle East Regional program. In recent years, USAID has allocated $15-20 million annually for Middle East Regional Democracy (NERD) and $30-40 million for the program. NERD promotes democracy and human rights in Iran, with a focus on Iranian activists operating outside the country due to resistance from the clerical regime. The Administration is requesting $30 million for NERD in FY2016. Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC), managed by USAID, supports research cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with a focus on water, agriculture, environment, and health sectors. The Administration is requesting $5 million for MERC in FY2016. The Administration is requesting $5 million for MERC in FY2016, which receives $1.5 million to $5 million annually. MEM receives $1.4 million annually for promoting technical cooperation between Arab and Israeli parties. TSCTP, funded through multiple accounts, aims to counter terrorism in North and West Africa, with $69.8 million requested for FY2016. The Administration is requesting $5 million for the \"Near East\" countries, with additional funding for sub-Saharan and North African participant countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation selects countries based on performance in ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. Morocco and Jordan have received MCC grants in the past for sectors like agriculture and education. The MCC approved a $275.1 million compact with Jordan in 2010 to improve water supply in Amman and Zarqa. Critics argue that countries with low democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid, but Jordan performed well on most indicators. The debate over funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing for years, with concerns raised about Jordan's eligibility due to its status as a large recipient of U.S. aid, access to private sector capital, and lack of democracy. The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks led to a shift in U.S. policy towards promoting democracy in the Middle East, which became a contentious issue during the Arab Spring. As authoritarianism resurges in the region, the U.S. foreign policy community is once again grappling with the question of funding democracy promotion. The U.S. foreign policy community is debating funding for democracy promotion in the Middle East. The Administration is requesting $442 million for democracy and governance activities in the region. Various U.S. government agencies and offices, including the State Department and USAID, contribute to democracy promotion efforts in the Middle East. MEPI, within the State Department, supports political reform, women's and youth empowerment, quality education, and promoting democracy. MEPI, a program within the State Department, supports political reform, women's and youth empowerment, quality education, and economic opportunity in the Arab world. Congress has allocated around $913.4 to $960.6 million in Economic Support Funds for MEPI since 2002. MEPI directly funds indigenous NGOs in the Middle East and North Africa, including a Local Grants Program to build capacity for small organizations. However, legal restrictions in some countries may pose risks for cooperation. The State Department is requesting $70 million in ESF funding for MEPI in FY2016, with annual allocations averaging $76-80 million. In 2015, MEPI received $40.8 million. In FY2016, the State Department plans to allocate $8.5 million to local civil society organizations through MEPI's Local Grants Program. Israel has received $124.3 billion in bilateral assistance from the U.S. since World War II, with most aid being military assistance. Israel is also the largest recipient of U.S. Foreign Military Financing, with the President's FY2016 request encompassing 53% of the total FMF funding worldwide. Strong congressional support for Israel allows for benefits not available to other countries, such as using some military assistance for research and development. Israel receives U.S. military assistance for research, development, and purchases from Israeli manufacturers. The aid is delivered at the beginning of the fiscal year, and Israel can use cash flow financing for arms purchases. In addition to State Department-administered foreign assistance, Israel also receives funds from defense appropriations bills for missile defense programs. A 10-year, $30 billion military aid package was agreed upon between the Bush Administration and Israel for FY2009 to FY2018, with discussions for a future aid deal beyond FY2018. Egypt has received $76 billion in bilateral foreign aid from the U.S., including $1.3 billion annually in military aid since 1987. Egypt receives $1.3 billion annually in military aid from the U.S. since 1987, with funds coming from FMF, ESF, and IMET accounts. In FY2016, the President requested $1.3 billion in military assistance and $150 million in economic aid for Egypt. Aid to Egypt has been a focus since the 2013 ouster of President Mohammed Morsi, with conditions set by Congress in the FY2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Secretary of State waived the national security interest to provide assistance to Jordan in 2015. Total U.S. aid to Jordan from FY1951 to FY2015 was $15.83 billion. A non-binding MOU was signed in 2015 for $1 billion in annual foreign assistance to Jordan. The U.S. provides economic aid to Jordan through cash transfers and USAID programs, supporting Syrian refugees. Military assistance helps Jordan procure and maintain weapons systems, including F-16 fighters. The U.S. provides FMF grants to Jordan for F-16 fighters and AMRAAM missiles. Aid to Palestinians has totaled over $5 billion, with conditions and restrictions. Limited bilateral assistance has been provided since FY2014 due to political concerns. ESF has been given for budgetary assistance in the West Bank and Gaza. Future executive branch plans for funds allocation, including potential assistance to the PA budget, are uncertain. Most bilateral funds for Gaza are currently focused on humanitarian and economic recovery efforts. U.S. assistance for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria is channeled through UNRWA. The Administration's FY2016 request includes $442.0 million for West Bank and Gaza, with $370.0 million for economic and development programs and $72.0 million for security assistance. Additionally, $3.45 billion is requested for addressing the crisis in Syria and combating the Islamic State. The Department of Defense is requesting $715 million for train and equip programs for Iraqis and $600 million for Syrians in FY2016. The Administration is providing $1.6 billion in DOD/OCO funding for an \"Iraq Train and Equip Fund\" in FY2015. Of this amount, $1.23 billion is for the Iraqi Security Forces, $354 million for the Kurdish peshmerga, and $24 million for Sunni tribal fighters. The Administration is requesting $255 million for security assistance related to Syria in FY2016, including non-lethal assistance to opposition groups and justice sector support in opposition-held areas. Additionally, $20 million would support law enforcement training, border security training, and weapons abatement initiatives for opposition members. The United States is also proceeding with pre-existing Foreign Military Sales of combat aircraft and new sales of tanks and armored vehicles to replenish equipment lost or seized by the Islamic State. The FY2016 budget request includes $250 million in FMF-OCO to build up the capabilities of the ISF against the Islamic State. The Administration seeks $5.64 billion in global humanitarian assistance, with $1.63 billion in OCO funds for Syria and Iraq crisis. Since 2011, over $4 billion has been allocated for humanitarian needs in the Middle East region. The State Department and USAID have repurposed foreign aid for countries in transition or civil war in the Middle East region. The Administration sought more legal latitude and funding from Congress in FY2013 and FY2014 but was unsuccessful. Lawmakers had reservations about creating the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund. In FY2015, the Administration made another attempt to seek funding. In FY2015, the Administration sought increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds. The request abandoned creating a new account with new authorities and instead aimed to support reforms in transitional states with ESF funds at a lower level. The Joint Explanatory Statement in P.L. 113-235 included language supporting the \"Middle East Response\" and provided flexibility for the Department of State to transfer funding between accounts. Proposals for restructuring U.S. assistance to Egypt have been made since 2011, with some objections to maintaining the status quo. The White House announced a change in US military aid to Egypt, stopping cash flow financing starting in FY2018. Critics argue that financing expensive weapons perpetuates military control of society. The White House announced a change in US military aid to Egypt, stopping cash flow financing starting in FY2018. This decision follows a review of US foreign assistance policy towards Egypt after the 2013 ouster of former president Mohammed Morsi. The new policy aims to balance national security interests and democratic principles by maintaining security cooperation while moving away from traditional military-to-military foundations. The White House announced changes in US military aid to Egypt, including ending cash flow financing in FY2018. Public discussion of the proposed policy changes has been relatively muted. Aid to Palestinians is subject to conditions and restrictions, with no aid permitted for Hamas, the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PA employees in Gaza. Aid for a future Palestinian state would only be permitted if recipients commit to peaceful coexistence with Israel. The US has imposed conditions on aid to Palestinians, with restrictions on funding if they support ICC investigations against Israelis. Some lawmakers have called for aid suspension, but the State Department ensures compliance with relevant legislation. The Administration is requesting $134 million for Tunisia for FY2016 to support its transition to democracy, combat terrorism, and promote economic growth. This is more than double the FY2015 request and part of a larger aid package totaling $580 million allocated between FY2011 and FY2014. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have reported their versions of the FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.
