Military pay has been exempt from taxation during wartime for those in combat zones since 1913. The Internal Revenue Code exempts compensation for active service in combat zones, with specific limits for different ranks. Active duty pay, imminent danger/hostile fire pay, and reenlistment bonuses can be excluded from income for members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in combat zones. The Department of Defense determines pay exclusions for military personnel serving in combat zones, including reenlistment bonuses, accrued leave pay, duty-related pay, awards for suggestions made during service, and student loan repayments. States may adopt federal procedures for combat zone income tax exclusion, with variations in tax incentives for those serving in combat. In some states, military pay is exempt from taxes, with variations in tax incentives for combat zone service. Proposed civilian combat zone exclusion would provide additional tax savings for overseas personnel. U.S. federal civilian employees working overseas can exclude certain allowances under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for income tax exclusion in combat zones, a person must be a U.S. citizen with their tax home in a foreign country and be a resident of that country or have lived abroad for at least 330 days in a year. U.S. citizens can credit foreign taxes paid against their U.S. income taxes, but federal employees are usually exempt. The tax treatment of income earned abroad is justified by differences in cost of living and tax rates. Foreign tax credit can offset high foreign taxes or reduce U.S. taxes for those with low foreign taxes. In recent Congresses, proposals have been made to expand the income tax exclusion to include federal civilian employees in combat zones. Legislation such as the Federal Employee Combat Zone Tax Parity Act aims to provide tax benefits similar to those for members of the Armed Forces serving in combat zones. Amendments have been proposed to extend the combat zone tax treatment to civilian employees of the Department of Defense working in combat zones. H.R. 878 proposes extending combat zone exclusion benefits to civilian DOD personnel and contractors. The combat zone income exclusion is a federal subsidy favoring income earned in combat. The rationale for this military tax benefit is to reduce tax burdens during wartime, not to incentivize employment in combat zones. Tax incentives aim to encourage more activity, but market failures may necessitate distortions by taxes and other factors. Market failures can lead to inefficiencies in resource allocation when marginal benefits are less than marginal costs. These failures can be caused by externalities, public goods, imperfect competition, or incomplete information. Tax subsidies can improve efficiency in the presence of market failures, but may lower efficiency if they distort behavior without addressing a market failure. The combat zone income tax exclusion does not address a market failure and is unlikely to distort behavior, therefore not improving economic efficiency. The success of tax incentives can be measured by their ability to elicit the intended response from recipients. The combat zone income tax exclusion is an additional benefit for members of the Armed Forces, with debates on extending it to civilian employees. The purpose could be additional compensation for those in combat or equity with armed forces benefits. Efficiency questions arise regarding using a tax subsidy versus direct payment, as subsidies benefit individuals differently based on household characteristics. The variance in benefit from tax subsidies is considered inefficient by economists. An alternative subsidy for combat zone income tax exclusion could be increasing income earned in combat through hazardous duty pay or imminent danger pay. This would have budgetary effects but could be less scrutinized than direct spending programs. Income tax exclusions subtract a portion of gross income before arriving at adjusted gross income, benefiting taxpayers based on income, marital status, and dependents. The tax system varies based on income, marital status, and dependents, affecting taxpayers differently. Progressivity means higher income leads to a higher tax percentage. Exclusions from taxation benefit more those in higher tax brackets. The tax system varies based on income, marital status, and dependents, affecting taxpayers differently. Exclusions from taxation benefit more those in higher tax brackets. The income tax exclusion for civilians serving overseas depends on meeting specific criteria, with federal civilians unable to benefit from the $82,400 exclusion but able to exclude housing and certain allowances. Non-federal civilians can claim the exclusion if they meet the required time spent overseas. An income tax exclusion for non-federal civilians in combat zones would primarily benefit high-income households, potentially reducing the progressivity of the tax system. Extending this exclusion may not be necessary as personnel in combat zones are not subject to foreign taxes. The distinction between military service and civilian employment is important when considering equal benefits. Military personnel face unique risks and limitations compared to civilians. Military personnel have strict duties and obligations, including working 24/7, following orders without question, and facing criminal punishment for disobedience. They are controlled by a chain of command and subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In contrast, civilian employees have more flexibility in their duties and contracts, with the possibility of incentives for working in combat zones. The authority over civilians is limited, except during times of war when they are subject to the UCMJ. Civilians accompanying armed forces in combat zones, including government employees, contractors, war correspondents, and labor units, may be at risk of becoming casualties of war. Advocates argue for extending income tax exclusion to civilians in dangerous situations as a gesture of national gratitude. The Iraq war saw 2,363 fatalities by December 2005, with civilian DOD employees accounting for five of them. This contrasts with 2,145 Armed Forces members and 110 contractors who also lost their lives. Despite civilians making up only 2.5% of those in service in Iraq, they represented just 0.2% of the fatalities. Arguments have been made for extending combat tax benefits to civilians, but some believe they already receive adequate compensation through danger pay allowances. Imminent danger pay provides additional compensation to U.S. Government civilian employees in foreign areas with dangerous conditions. Civilian DOD employees receive varying rates of imminent danger pay based on the level of danger. Opponents argue that civilian contractors already receive higher salaries as a risk premium for combat zone service, making income tax exclusion unnecessary and potentially reducing government tax revenue. Private contractors in Iraq are paid lucrative salaries, ranging from $350 to $1,500 a day, which can exceed $100,000 a year. This high pay attracts experienced military personnel, depleting the ranks of the Armed Forces. Former military personnel working for private security firms typically make two to 10 times more than they would in the military, with examples like a former Green Beret earning up to $1,000 a day in Iraq. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded a $350,000 per year contract to a private firm for disposing of captured munitions in Iraq. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) found that contractors in Iraq offered various allowances, bonuses, and benefits in addition to base pay, including hardship pay, danger pay allowance, assignment completion bonuses, and foreign service premiums. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, 83% of deployed civilians were contractors, while 17% were civilian federal workers. Some contractors in the Department of Defense perform traditional civilian support roles, while others serve in more dangerous security force positions. The distinction between civilian DOD employees and contractors complicates equalization of benefits. Civilian DOD personnel operate with similar commitment and control as military personnel, while contractors may not. Commanders have more control over DOD employees than contractors, who are employed by third parties under contract to the United States. The ability to ensure contractors abide by federal laws depends on the contract between the firm and the DOD. Military commanders have less control over contractors and fewer recourse options. The combat zone income tax exclusion places administrative burden on employers to separate nontaxable income from taxable income and report it to the IRS. Contractors in combat zones may face new reporting requirements and additional expenses. Combat zones can be designated by the President or Congress, and the DOD can extend tax benefits to military personnel providing direct support to combat zones. The Persian Gulf area, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are designated combat zones for tax relief. Military personnel in Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea east of 30 degrees East longitude also qualify for combat zone tax benefits. The certification for Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea area expired on April 20, 2003, and July 31, 2003, respectively. Military operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and other designated combat zones qualify for tax relief under Code Sec. 112. Members of the Armed Forces from Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Jordan are eligible for combat zone tax benefits for their service in Afghanistan. The DOD certification started on September 19, 2001, for Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Jordan, and on October 1, 2001, for Kyrgystan and Uzbekistan. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia are designated as qualified hazardous duty areas for tax relief under P.L. 104-117. U.S. peace-keeping troops in Joint Endeavor or Operation Able Sentry can exclude combat zone compensation from gross income under Code Section 112."
