    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing federal financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certifications. There is a growing demand for workers in jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree. Despite over $100 billion in annual federal financial aid for postsecondary education, most of these funds do not support non-degree programs. Despite the significant federal financial aid available for postsecondary education, a large portion of it does not support non-degree programs. To address this gap, there have been proposals to increase direct federal support for students pursuing short-term non-degree programs. This includes initiatives like allowing Pell Grants for non-degree programs and the introduction of the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) to provide more support for students in these programs. The Education and Labor committee reported the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) to expand Pell Grants to non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers proposed options to retrain workers for the changing economy. The President's FY2021 budget requested expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs. Some stakeholders support this, but others are concerned about promoting non-degree programs. Some concerns exist regarding the quality and cost of non-degree programs, as well as the potential impact on income inequalities. Employers are increasingly favoring degree holders over non-degree credential holders, which may lead to difficulties in securing long-term employment for the latter. The report discusses the challenges faced by adults with degrees in securing long-term employment and how they may be crowding out non-degree holders from certain occupations. It provides an overview of federal programs supporting individuals in non-degree training and education programs, highlighting employer demand for non-degree program graduates and detailing various federal programs and tax benefits that offer financial support to students in training. The report highlights federal programs and tax benefits providing financial support to students in non-degree training programs. It addresses the need for individuals with non-degree credentials in the workforce and the potential economic benefits of attaining a non-degree postsecondary credential. Data on employment proportions and wages by education requirements are also discussed. The report discusses the impacts of increased non-degree program completion, highlighting the proportion of jobs requiring non-degree credentials and their corresponding mean annual wages. It also mentions the potential earnings differentials within education categories, emphasizing the value of certain types of certificates in fields like electronics and healthcare. Postsecondary non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age for specific occupations. These programs provide a combination of courses or curriculum to fulfill educational or professional goals, leading to a postsecondary educational certificate upon completion. Non-degree instructional programs are credentials awarded by educational institutions for completing postsecondary programs. These programs are pursued for various reasons such as expanding knowledge, preparing for further education or employment, and seeking promotion. They exclude postbaccalaureate certificates and transfer programs, which provide education for at least two academic years towards a bachelor's degree. Non-degree programs should not be confused with certifications or licenses, which are occupational credentials assessing competency in specific occupations. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities including traditional postsecondary institutions, trade schools, businesses, and government organizations. These programs vary in length and can range from a few days to over two years. The length is determined by curriculum requirements, industry standards, and the skills being taught. The duration of non-degree instructional programs can be influenced by various factors such as federal, state, and private requirements. Programs can be offered in different formats including classrooms, online, or through a combination of methods. Students are responsible for funding the program costs, which can vary depending on the length and provider. For example, the average cost for tuition and fees in heavily enrolled programs was over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and around $15,000 at private institutions. There is a distinction between credit and noncredit courses within these programs. Credit programs offer courses for credit that can be transferred to other programs, while noncredit programs do not offer credits but may provide vocational certificates. Noncredit programs are more affordable, cover a wider range of topics, and can be quickly adapted to industry needs. Noncredit programs cater to industry and student needs, offering vocational, ABE, ESL, and GED courses. Enrollment data is incomplete at the national level, with 8% of adults holding postsecondary certificates. HEA Title IV institutions awarded 1 million non-degree credentials and 3 million undergraduate degrees in AY2017-2018. Work-based learning encompasses various training activities to develop workplace skills, such as OJT, apprenticeships, internships, and co-op programs. RA programs, overseen by the DOL, adhere to federal regulations and offer earn and learn opportunities. Work-based learning programs must adhere to federal regulations, including the requirement for a work process schedule outlining competencies and a review every five years. Various entities can offer work-based learning experiences, tailored to meet the needs of employers, potential employers, or trainees. Summer internships, for example, provide informal training opportunities. Work-based learning programs, such as internships and RA programs, offer training opportunities through supervised on-the-job training. RA programs typically last four years and can be time-based or competency-based. Program costs are primarily covered by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living expenses. Some work-based learning programs may require trainees to pay for related costs, such as transportation and board. Data on employer-provided training is limited and varies in methodology. Surveys show that 16% to 70% of workers receive training, with 21% of adults completing work-based learning programs in 2016. Among adults aged 16-65, work-based learning programs in healthcare and teaching are common. The Department of Labor reported 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs in FY2019, with 81,000 completing a program. The construction industry has the most apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. Federal programs provide financial support for training and education to help individuals enter the workforce and reach their potential, but none focus solely on non-degree programs. The federal programs and benefits, such as WIOA Title I, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance, support workforce development and education. WIOA Title I subsidizes training costs, federal student aid programs offer grants and loans for postsecondary education, tax benefits provide financial support, and VA administers educational assistance programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide financial support for education and training programs. SNAP E&T and TANF offer training and education opportunities for individuals at risk. These federal programs support students in non-degree programs with key design elements highlighted in the report. WIOA Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act aims to increase employment, earnings, and postsecondary credentials for participants. It is administered by DOL and provides formula grants to states for Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities. Funds are used for establishing One-Stop delivery systems, career services, and training services at the local level. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides a One-Stop delivery system for career services, training, and partnerships with employers. Participants have consumer choice in accessing basic and individualized career services. Eligible participants can pursue training at an Eligible Training Provider of their choice listed on the state's ETPL, including institutions of higher education and other training providers. The WIOA allows for training activities supported by Title I funds, including non-degree and degree programs, work-based learning like OJT and customized training. Training must be for in-demand occupations in the local area, leading to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, or employment. Up to 20% of funds can be reserved for incumbent worker training. The workforce development system under WIOA aims for universal access to training opportunities. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides universal access to career services for adults aged 18 or older in the United States. Individualized career services are offered to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Eligibility for training services is based on the need to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, skills and qualifications for training, and the inability to receive other grant assistance. Determinations are made by a One-Stop operator through interviews or assessments. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides career services for adults, with training services prioritizing public assistance recipients, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local WDBs determine fund allocation for training services, which can be provided through ITAs or contracts. Supportive services like child care and transportation are also covered under WIOA. Eligibility for training services is determined by One-Stop operators through assessments. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows eligible individuals to choose training services from the ETPL through an ITA established by One-Stop operators. Local WDBs can set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual circumstances. ITA funds can support non-degree programs, degree programs, and related instruction. Supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments are also provided to enable participation in training. Training can be provided through the ITA model or contracts for services, including work-based learning. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows for training services to be provided through contracts for services, such as On-the-Job Training (OJT), Rapid Response (RA), customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) can enter into contracts with employers or RA sponsors for occupational training of WIOA participants in exchange for reimbursement. Reimbursement rates can vary, with WDBs able to reimburse up to 50% of a participant's wage rate through a contract. Additionally, WDBs may reimburse RA sponsors for up to 75% of an apprentice's wages through contracts. States are responsible for developing these contract agreements. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows for training services to be provided through contracts for services, such as On-the-Job Training (OJT), Rapid Response (RA), customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment. States are responsible for developing the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL), with local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) and One-Stop operators administering training programs and payments. Quality assurance for training providers is ensured through initial and continued eligibility processes, with criteria and procedures established by the governor and state WDB. Non-RA training providers must apply for initial eligibility, and existing providers must follow procedures for continued eligibility as per WIOA requirements. Local WDBs have discretion on specific factors, such as OJT contracts. The WIOA allows for various training services like OJT, RA, and incumbent worker training. Local WDBs have discretion in determining factors like the length of OJT contracts and employer eligibility. Providers must report program participation and outcomes, with RA programs exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years for continued eligibility under WIOA Title I. The WIOA requires states to publish annual performance reports on program participants' earnings, credential attainment, cost of attendance, and completion rates. Governors may request additional performance information as needed. Reports must detail the total number of participants receiving training services, exits from training, and average cost per participant for each program of study eligible for WIOA funds. The WIOA ETP performance reports must include data on participants with barriers to employment served by WIOA Title I programs, disaggregated by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Recent data shows high participation in work-based learning, with a majority of adult and dislocated worker participants aged 30 and over, unemployed or laid off. Some participants have postsecondary education experience. Training services usage among program exiters in 2018 was low, with fewer than 20% engaging in work-based learning. In program year 2018, fewer than 20% of WIOA Title I participants engage in work-based learning. The majority pursue skills training through non-degree instructional and degree programs with ITAs. Popular occupations for adults include healthcare, transportation, and production, while dislocated workers focus on transportation, computer, office support, and management. WIOA Title I supports adult workforce entry primarily through career services, but also offers short-term training and education. Suggestions for improvement include increasing access to non-degree training, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and ensuring current workers remain employed despite changing skill requirements. Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance programs for students at certain institutions. Grants and loans are available to financially needy students, with Pell Grants and Direct Loans being the primary types of aid. The programs aim to promote access, affordability, and completion of higher education. Non-degree program quality may vary due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. Restrictions on recipients obtaining other grant assistance could be eliminated to allow programs to supplement each other. Title IV authorizes financial aid programs for students at postsecondary education institutions. Pell Grants and Direct Loans are available to all eligible individuals, regardless of congressional appropriations. These programs can be used for Title IV-eligible programs of study, including non-degree instructional and degree programs. Title IV-participating institutions must meet specific criteria, including quality assurance standards. Non-degree programs at Title IV-participating institutions must meet eligibility requirements, including leading to a recognized non-degree credential. Title IV aid is not available for noncredit programs or programs without defined credit or clock hours. Work-based learning must be supervised by the institution, with OJT portion limited if offered by an external entity. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements for instructional time and credit or clock hours. Public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions offer non-degree programs eligible for Pell Grants. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions must meet specific durational requirements for instructional time and credit or clock hours to be eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loans. Students must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Programs that are at least one academic year in length and lead to a recognized non-degree credential are eligible for both Pell Grants and Direct Loans without specific durational requirements. To be eligible for Title IV funds for higher education, students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program and meet citizenship and education criteria. Pell Grants require enrollment in an undergraduate program, financial need, and have a lifetime cap of 12 full-time semesters. Direct Loan program loans have specific enrollment criteria. Students must meet program-specific criteria to qualify for Direct Loan program loans, including being enrolled at least half-time. Additional eligibility criteria may be required for specific loan types such as Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, are limited to borrowing Direct Subsidized Loans for 150% of their program length. Title IV aid is subject to statutory award rules and cannot exceed a student's cost of attendance. The Cost of Attendance (COA) for educational expenses includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and dependent care. Pell Grant awards are determined independently of other financial aid and have a maximum amount set by annual appropriations. For AY 2020-2021, the maximum Pell Grant award is $6,345 for full-time students. Pell Grant taxation varies for degree and non-degree programs. Direct Loan program rules vary by loan type and borrower eligibility criteria. The Direct Loan program rules vary based on the type of loan borrowed and other factors affecting aid awarded. Limits on Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans are determined by dependency status and class level. For example, dependent undergraduates can borrow up to $5,500 in their first year, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $9,500. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs. The programs are completed by actors like FSA and IHEs, with FSA handling high-level functions in Title IV program administration. IHEs handle day-to-day functions like awarding and disbursing aid to students. ED provides funds to IHEs for aid disbursement, and IHEs also receive an administrative cost allowance under the Pell Grant program. HEA provisions ensure program and IHE quality, with a program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. The program integrity triad consists of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification, ensuring quality in Title IV programs. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. State approval and licensure requirements for IHEs vary among states, with some approving individual programs and others only requiring approval of the institution as a whole. State approval and licensure requirements for IHEs vary by state, evaluating program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Participation in Title IV programs requires accreditation by an ED-recognized accrediting agency, which assesses faculty, curricula, facilities, and student support services. Regional or national accreditation is typically sufficient for Title IV program participation. Accrediting agencies evaluate an IHE's faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but may be sought for employer and licensure requirements. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must apply for certification from ED and meet eligibility requirements for each educational program. The eligibility requirements for educational programs participating in the Direct Loan program include completion and placement rates of at least 70%. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, although the specific regulations defining this term were rescinded in 2019. The goal was to ensure that quality programs lead to earnings that enable students to repay their loans. Under the GE framework, programs must meet D/E rates and third-party standards to maintain Title IV eligibility. The HEA requires reporting on enrollment, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant information. Performance measures for Title IV programs are not defined by the HEA. In AY2017-2018, data from ED shows that 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating IHEs offered non-degree for-credit programs. Private for-profit IHEs offer half of these programs, while public IHEs award over two-thirds of non-degree for-credit credentials. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Additionally, 10% of undergraduates with Direct Loans were pursuing certificate programs. Support for non-degree programs is limited, with Title IV aid available only for specific credit programs at participating IHEs. Support for work-based learning at Title IV-participating IHEs is limited to programs leading to a certificate or degree. Students pursuing non-degree programs may not be eligible if they lack a high school diploma, have a bachelor's degree, or are enrolled less than half-time. Quality assessment of non-degree programs varies, primarily evaluated through state authorizers and accreditors due to the rescinded 2014 GE rules. State authorization requirements pose challenges in assessing institutional experiences with state authorization, with reports highlighting the complexity and variation among state requirements. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in state authorization requirements, including concerns about oversight by state boards, input requirements hindering innovative education models, lengthy authorization processes, conflicts across state laws for institutions offering programs in multiple states, and few states basing renewal decisions on student outcomes. The 2014 GAO report highlighted strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation system, such as tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment. Weaknesses include conflicting interests, lack of resources, and difficulty in assessing innovative education methods. Education tax benefits offset higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, favoring upper middle-income individuals. Education tax benefits are claimed by taxpayers when filing their federal income tax return, providing a tax benefit after paying for education expenses. These benefits are available to individuals in degree programs, with some eligibility for non-degree programs. Unlike other federal education programs, education tax benefits reduce federal revenues. They are considered a form of \"spending through the tax code\" and are not subject to annual appropriations. Taxpayers in non-degree programs may be eligible for benefits like the Lifetime Learning Credit. Taxpayers in non-degree programs may be eligible for the Lifetime Learning Credit, employer provided educational assistance, and 529 accounts to help save for educational expenses. These benefits can be used for tuition, books, supplies, and equipment at Title IV-eligible institutions. The Lifetime Learning Credit, employer provided educational assistance, and 529 accounts can be used for tuition, books, supplies, and equipment for non-degree programs. Employer assistance can cover up to $5,250 of tuition costs without being included in the employee's income. The institution providing the program does not need to be Title IV-eligible. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses at a Title IV-eligible IHE. Eligibility for tax benefits depends on filing a federal income tax return or being claimed as a dependent. Employers must offer educational assistance programs for participants to claim the tax credit. Beneficiaries of a 529 account are designated at its establishment. Individuals can apply for the LLC when filing their federal income tax return after incurring qualified educational expenses. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. Employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year under an employer-sponsored educational assistance program. Taxpayers can withdraw funds from their 529 accounts tax-free to pay for qualifying education expenses. The IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for proper administration of benefits. Taxpayers apply for the LLC by filing their federal income tax return and Form 8863. They do not need to list the course or program of study they are enrolled in when applying for the LLC. Employees must provide information about their educational institution on Form 8863 when applying for the LLC on their federal income tax return. An employer's educational assistance program must be in written form and meet specific requirements to qualify. The program cannot discriminate in favor of certain employees and must provide reasonable notice of its terms. 529 plans are generally sponsored by states, allowing individuals to establish accounts for a beneficiary. When withdrawing funds from a 529 plan, the program must provide the taxpayer with the necessary information. When a taxpayer withdraws from a 529 plan, they receive Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. If funds are used for non-eligible expenses, a portion may be subject to taxation on federal income tax returns. Taxpayers do not need to document how withdrawals are spent unless audited. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. Limited IRS data shows that in 2015, 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Approximately half of all LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $200,000. Taxpayers with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC due to nonrefundability and phase-out. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Data on exclusion of employer-provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable. Few families establish 529 plans, with those who do having higher assets and income. No studies have evaluated the impact of 529 plans on non-degree program enrollment or effectiveness in improving job skills. The research highlights limitations of education tax benefits for non-degree programs, such as delayed assistance for upfront costs and confusion over eligibility. These benefits only help taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income individuals. Veterans education programs were originally aimed at aiding former servicemembers in transitioning to civilian life. The benefits for veterans have been renewed and revised to compensate for service, avoid unemployment, and promote military retention. VET TEC incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment. The GI Bills and VET TEC provide financial assistance to students enrolled in approved education programs. GI Bills are funded with mandatory spending, while VET TEC is funded by a limited allocation from GI Bill appropriations. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide financial assistance for education and training programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the main source of GI Bill participation and spending since FY2013, supporting degree pursuit as well as work-based learning and non-degree programs. VET TEC benefits are specifically for non-degree high-technology programs at approved training providers. The VET TEC program offers high-technology education through approved training providers for eligible servicemembers and veterans. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available, including living stipend payments. Eligibility criteria include meeting active duty service requirements and not exceeding annual VA caps for tuition and fees. Transfer of benefits to family members is possible, and spouses and children of servicemembers who die in the line of duty are also eligible. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC programs provide living stipend payments and cover program costs. Eligible individuals can receive personalized counseling to help with career paths and VA benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers educational assistance payments over 36 months, with options for benefit transfers. Payment amounts and eligibility depend on various factors like benefit level, program pursued, and location of education. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC programs provide living stipend payments and cover program costs. Eligible individuals can receive personalized counseling to help with career paths and VA benefits. The benefit level is based on qualifying active duty service. Payments for tuition, fees, housing, books, supplies, and additional monthly payments are available while enrolled in education or training. Veterans may receive up to $24,476.79 in tuition and fees, monthly housing allowance between $800 and $4,300, and up to $1,000 for books and supplies. Veterans pursuing OJT or apprenticeship receive a decreasing housing allowance to offset wage increases. Under VET TEC, veterans receive payments for training from the VA. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment. Participants apply to the VA for eligibility and can enroll in approved programs. Educational institutions certify enrollment to the VA, which verifies eligibility and distributes payments. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payment amounts, and distributes payments for GI Bill-approved programs. Program quality is determined by state approving agencies and participant employment outcomes for VET TEC programs. The VA and SAAs share oversight responsibilities to ensure program quality and proper administration of benefits. Standards for education programs, institutions, and training establishments are established to address poor quality and abuse reports, including program objectives, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangements. The program quality for GI Bill-approved programs is determined by state approving agencies and participant employment outcomes for VET TEC programs. Independent study programs must be accredited by an ED-recognized agency and lead to a degree or certificate meeting specific criteria. The 85-15 rule limits institutional aid coverage for students, and programs offered through contractual agreements must be approved for GI Bill purposes. Non-degree programs must meet facility, instructor, and curriculum standards, while programs preparing individuals for licensure must meet relevant instructional requirements. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC programs, which must meet various standards including faculty qualifications and curriculum alignment. Payment structure ensures program quality and value by reimbursing providers upon completion and meaningful employment within 180 days. The VET TEC program requires training providers to be licensed, meet quality standards, and not be self-paced. The VA reports annually on program outcomes to assess effectiveness in preparing individuals for future employment. Performance measures include job placement rates, median salary, and transfer rates to other programs. Approximately 9% of GI Bill participants pursued educational certificates in 2013, with 0.4% pursuing OJT or apprenticeships in FY2018. Over 18,000 school locations, including private for-profit, public, and private nonprofit schools, offered programs approved for GI Bill purposes. The most popular certificates completed by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is limited to individuals who have served in the uniformed services. Program eligibility is limited to individuals who have served in the uniformed services and their family members. Recent examinations found that oversight of the program may be compromised, with limitations on funding, scope of oversight actions, and controls for reviewing approval standards. SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits for eligible low-income households to purchase food. States also receive SNAP Employment & Training funding to provide employment and education services for participants. The SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) program, established in 1987, aims to help SNAP participants gain skills for employment. States can choose to make E&T programs mandatory or voluntary, with most states operating voluntary programs. Components of E&T programs include job search programs, training, workfare, and work experience. The SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) program offers job search training, workfare, work experience, education, and self-employment training. Funding includes mandatory and open-ended federal match for states' administrative expenses. USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative operate SNAP to Skills project to provide technical assistance for job-driven SNAP E&T programs. The SNAP E&T program must be integrated with the WIOA Title I program and delivered through the statewide workforce development system. SNAP E&T recipients can access services through WIOA One-Stop centers, but SNAP staff are better equipped to address their unique challenges. Educational activities provided by SNAP E&T programs include improving basic skills, job search abilities, and employability through programs like high school equivalency, remedial education, and English as a second language instruction. Only educational components directly enhancing employability are allowed. SNAP E&T education activities must have a direct link to employment and help participants move promptly into employment. Vocational training, basic education, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships are common offerings. Participants must meet income and nonfinancial eligibility requirements to participate in SNAP. Under current law, SNAP participants must meet income requirements at or below 100% of the federal poverty level, with some states allowing up to 200%. Work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults, who must register for work and maintain at least 30 hours per week. States can design SNAP E&T programs for this population, with mandatory participation options. USDA guidance mandates assessment for effective program placement. The 2018 farm bill requires all states to offer case management services for SNAP E&T participants. The 2018 farm bill mandates all states to provide case management services for SNAP E&T participants, covering costs of education, program development, and associated expenses like dependent care and transportation. E&T funds are administered by state agencies and can be used for specific education programs or partnerships. USDA-FNS promotes third-party partnerships for SNAP E&T programs, where states collaborate with entities like community colleges. Partners contribute financially, and states reimburse them using federal funds. Pell Grant-eligible students must use Pell Grants first for college expenses. E&T funds can cover remaining expenses, but other funding sources should be explored first. Workforce partnerships were added to the program by the 2018 farm bill, involving private employers, nonprofits, and training providers. SNAP E&T programs are designed by states within federal rules and require USDA-FNS approval. State programs vary in capacity and services offered. The 2018 farm bill mandates consultation with state workforce development boards or private employers. Participants learn about programs through SNAP state agencies or partner referrals. States monitor program quality, with USDA-FNS providing assistance. USDA established performance indicators reporting per the 2014 farm bill. USDA has finalized regulations for performance indicators reporting in SNAP E&T programs. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median wages after program completion. Most participants receive services other than education. Some states served fewer than 100 participants, while others served nearly 100,000. The SNAP E&T program has limitations, with fewer than 10% of participants receiving education. Information on program quality and subsequent employment outcomes is lacking. Wages earned may increase household income, potentially reducing eligibility for SNAP. TANF block grants aim to promote work, job preparation, and marriage to reduce dependence on government benefits. States have flexibility in how they use TANF funds. TANF block grants provide states flexibility to achieve statutory purposes, including supporting needy families with children. Funds can be used for various benefits and services, including education and training programs like career pathways. One state program uses TANF funds to pay coordinators at a community college who serve as case managers, recruit students, and provide support services. TANF allows for a variety of vocational education programs for low-income families with children, with eligibility determined by the state. Data shows that many TANF recipients have limited education levels. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children, with states determining eligibility rules and benefit amounts. Adult recipients must participate in required activities like training and education, with benefits reduced or ended for non-compliance. TANF also provides support services such as advising, career planning, and employment services. State TANF programs may refer assistance recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment, while some states operate separate employment and training services for TANF recipients. The minimum work participation rate (WPR) is TANF's main performance measure, requiring a minimum percentage of the assistance caseload to be working or engaged in activities. States have flexibility in meeting this requirement, including through reducing the cash assistance caseload. The TANF cash assistance caseload is disadvantaged in education, limiting participation in non-degree programs. Single mothers with young children make up most TANF recipients. States can use TANF funds for child care. There are limitations on vocational training due to lifetime limits and income eligibility thresholds. The quality of training programs is unknown."
