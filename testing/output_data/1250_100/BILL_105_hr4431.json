    "content": "The Act is titled the \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" and includes an amendment regarding partner notification in HIV health care services. It adds a new section, 2616A, to the Public Health Service Act. The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" requires states to have laws or regulations in place for partner notification in HIV health care services. This includes confidential reporting of positive test results and providing partners with information about potential exposure to the disease. The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" mandates that partners exposed to HIV are provided with counseling, testing, and referrals for services without disclosing the infected individuals' identities. Counseling includes information on transmission, prevention, therapeutic measures, and immune system deterioration. Notifications under the HIV Partner Protection Act are provided in person unless it is an unreasonable burden on the State. There are no penalties for infected individuals who choose not to identify their partners or for errors made in reporting. The State is not liable for failing to notify partners, and the program does not prohibit the State from providing notifications. State insurance laws must prohibit insurers from penalizing individuals who undergo testing for HIV disease after being exposed. This requirement is necessary for a State to receive a grant under this part. Regulations must be in place to protect individuals who choose to get tested for HIV. The term 'infected individual' refers to someone with HIV disease, while 'partner' includes spouses, sexual partners, and individuals exposed to HIV disease. Certain states have delayed applicability for meeting grant requirements related to HIV testing regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants to States to assist with the costs of implementing partner notification programs for HIV. $10,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 for this purpose."
