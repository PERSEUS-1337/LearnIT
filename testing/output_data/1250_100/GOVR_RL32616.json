The report emphasized the need to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities and issued recommendations related to immigration law and policy. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized the importance of targeting terrorist travel as a powerful weapon. Recommendations include integrating the U.S. border security system into a larger screening network, implementing a biometric entry-exit system, and collaborating with other governments to prevent terrorist entry. Immigration-related reforms have been a key focus in legislative proposals. In the 108th Congress, two bills related to implementing 9/11 Commission recommendations on immigration law were passed by the House and Senate. These bills faced contention over immigration provisions, leading to the compromise bill, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This compromise bill, signed on December 17, 2004, included some immigration provisions from the original proposals. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations included actions to identify and intercept terrorists entering or leaving the US. Congress passed laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act to expedite the development of an automated entry and exit data system with biometric identifiers. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 aimed to keep inadmissible aliens abroad. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required the implementation of a pre-inspection program at selected locations overseas for aliens entering the United States. Proposals in the 108th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the US, including the development of a biometric entry and exit data system integrated with various databases. The House and Senate have passed bills to enhance security measures for passengers of cruise ships, implement watchlists, improve passport security, and strengthen visa issuance processes. Additionally, there are efforts to establish pre-enrollment programs for expedited inspections at ports of entry and enhance detection of fraudulent documents at foreign airports. The House and Senate have passed bills to improve security measures for visa issuance, including training for consular officers in detecting fraudulent documents and establishing an Office of Visa and Passport Security. Additionally, there are provisions to require interviews for nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 12 to 65 and to enhance international agreements to curb terrorist travel. The House-passed bill aims to enhance security measures for U.S. citizens traveling abroad or entering the United States by requiring valid U.S. passports, with waivers only granted for travelers to/from foreign contiguous territories with designated identification documents. It also amends waiver authority for arriving foreign nationals, requiring a joint determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State based on reciprocity. Additionally, it mandates the development and implementation of a plan for the use of biometric passports. The Senate-passed bill requires U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories to present biometric passports for travel into the United States. Differences between the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of the bill include grounds for alien exclusion, removal, and relief from removal. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes admission and removal criteria for foreign nationals entering the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act in the United States has evolved over the years, expanding grounds for inadmissibility and deportation while also limiting relief from removal. Despite efforts to restrict judicial review of removal decisions, the Supreme Court maintains a strong presumption in favor of judicial review, including habeas review for pure questions of law. Additionally, post-9/11, Congress further broadened terrorism grounds for inadmissibility. In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress expanded terrorism grounds for inadmissibility, removal, and mandatory detention in the USA PATRIOT Act. Proposals included barring aliens engaged in terrorist activity from relief from removal and expanding grounds for inadmissibility and deportation related to terrorist activities. The House-passed bill expands definitions related to terrorist organizations and activities, including providing support to such organizations. It also addresses inadmissibility and removal of aliens involved in genocide, torture, or religious freedom violations abroad. Additionally, it clarifies the criteria for removal to an alien's country of citizenship, birth, or residence, and grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in choosing removal destinations. The bill also broadens the class of aliens subject to immediate removal upon arrival in the United States. The House-passed bill expands definitions related to terrorist organizations and activities, inadmissibility, and removal of aliens involved in serious crimes abroad. It also clarifies removal criteria and grants discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Additionally, it broadens the class of aliens subject to immediate removal upon arrival in the United States. The United States upholds the principle of not returning foreign nationals to countries where their life or freedom is at risk. Asylum seekers must show a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Regulations also prevent the return of individuals to countries where there is a risk of torture. Proposed changes to asylum and relief from removal include stricter standards for applicants accused of terrorist activities. The House-passed legislation allows for the indefinite detention of aliens deemed a danger to national security, with periodic reviews by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Concerns have been raised about terrorist aliens obtaining U.S. identification documents, as highlighted by the 9/11 Commission's report on the hijackers' use of such documents for their activities. The Commission recommended national standards for birth certificates and drivers' licenses to prevent fraud. Controversy surrounds the issuance of these forms of identification, with concerns about creating a national ID card. Congress provided standards for state licenses and birth certificates for federal use, but this was later repealed. After 9/11, proposals were made to increase federal oversight and security for these documents, as well as Social Security documents. Proposals were made to improve identification verification procedures and the security of personal identification documents, including federal agencies not accepting state-issued documents that do not meet national minimum standards. The proposals aim to enhance identification verification procedures and document security by enforcing national standards for state-issued documents, conducting audits for compliance, linking state motor vehicle databases, implementing electronic birth and death registration systems, and restricting the issuance of multiple replacement Social Security cards. The proposals aim to enhance identification verification procedures and document security by enforcing national standards for state-issued documents, such as driver's licenses and birth certificates. This includes prohibiting the display of Social Security numbers on driver's licenses, improving the application process for newborn Social Security numbers, studying photographic identification requirements for Social Security numbers, and requiring independent verification of birth records for Social Security applications. Additionally, it mandates that aliens present valid foreign passports or immigration documents for federal identification purposes. DHS is responsible for enforcing immigration laws and border security through agencies like CBP and ICE. Other federal agencies, like the State Department, also play a role in screening aliens seeking visas. Recommendations are made to improve homeland security and document security, including national standards for state-issued documents and prohibiting the display of Social Security numbers on driver's licenses. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a robust border security system to identify individuals entering the United States. Various proposals were made to enhance border security, including increasing border patrol agents, immigration investigators, and consular officers. Additionally, recommendations included improving training for immigration enforcement officials and deploying technologies like biometrics for document authentication. The House and Senate have passed bills to enhance border security, including increasing appropriations for pre-inspection at foreign airports, expediting construction of barriers at the San Diego border, and implementing surveillance plans using remotely piloted aircraft. Additionally, there are requirements for advanced technology security pilot programs on the Northern border. The INA governs rules for aliens entering and staying in the United States.
