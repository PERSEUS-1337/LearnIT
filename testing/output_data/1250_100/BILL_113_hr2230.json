    "content": "The \"Track It to Prevent It Act\" includes provisions for improved climate assessments, tracking of results, service-wide assessments, health welfare inspections, and reviews of security and diversity management in the military. It also authorizes appropriations for these measures. Congress found an increase in reported sexual assault cases in the Armed Forces in fiscal year 2012, with a significant rise in anonymous reports. A high percentage of female and male members who experienced unwanted sexual contact also faced sexual harassment. Retaliation was perceived by a majority of those who reported unwanted sexual contact. Climate assessments are required by law for commanders to create a safe environment for their unit. Trends in harmful behavior like sexual harassment and assault must be identified early through improved reporting. Members often don't report incidents due to fear of repercussions on their military career. Commanders condoning or ignoring sexual misconduct perpetuates a culture of misconduct in the military. The Act defines \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault\" according to specific directives and laws. It also focuses on improving climate assessments and the dissemination of results to address issues like sexual misconduct in the military. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that command climate assessment results are shared with relevant commanders and higher levels of command. Senior commanders must indicate compliance with assessments in performance evaluations, failure to conduct assessments will impact promotions. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense will develop a tracking system for assessments. Unit commanders, in collaboration with the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, are required to compile climate assessments from their units and create a compliance report. The report must include an overview of member concerns, data on leadership perception, and a strategic plan to address the expressed concerns. The Secretary of Defense mandates the inclusion of reprimands, counseling statements, and actions related to sexual harassment or assault in performance evaluations to increase visibility, identify trends of misconduct early, and prevent the transfer of offenders. Additionally, service-wide 360 assessments are required. SEC. 6 mandates the adoption of a 360-degree assessment program by military departments and the inclusion of individual counseling in performance evaluations. SEC. 7 requires monthly health welfare inspections to maintain security and discipline in the Armed Forces. SEC. 8 mandates a review of security at military installations, including barracks and multi-family residences. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and multi-family residences to ensure the safety of Armed Forces members and their dependents. The review will identify security gaps and assess the feasibility of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel at entry points. A report with cost estimates to address security gaps and provide 24-hour monitoring must be submitted to Congress within 90 days. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and multi-family residences to ensure safety. This includes evaluating 24-hour security monitoring as required by subsection (b)(2). The Secretary of Defense will review the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity's role in sexual harassment cases, including resource gaps and collaboration with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal year 2014."
