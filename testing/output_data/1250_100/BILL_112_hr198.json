    "content": "The \"Veterans Dog Training Therapy Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Department of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program on dog training therapy. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program at select medical centers to assess the effectiveness of using service dogs to help veterans with post-deployment mental health issues. The program will last for five years and include training areas that are wheelchair accessible and suitable for grooming and training dogs indoors. The pilot program will include wheelchair accessible training areas, classroom space, office space, storage for equipment, outdoor exercise space for dogs, and transportation for field trips. The program will be administered by the Recreation Therapy Service of the Department of Veterans Affairs under the direction of a certified recreational therapist. A director of service dog training will oversee the training of dogs at selected medical centers. The pilot program for training service dogs in a vocational setting requires certified instructors, selection of dogs from shelters or foster homes, teaching essential commands, living at the training site, hands-on training, and grooming. The pilot program aims to maximize therapeutic benefits for veterans with disabilities by providing well-trained service dogs. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health conditions can participate if resources are available. Hiring preference is given to veterans who have graduated from treatment programs and received certification in service dog training. Data collection is also required. The Secretary will collect data on the pilot program to assess its effectiveness for veterans, including reducing stigma, improving emotional regulation, patience, sense of purpose, community reintegration, relationship skills, sleep patterns, and decreasing pain medication use. The Secretary will report to Congress annually on the pilot program's effects on veterans, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, family dynamics, insomnia, pain management, and overall well-being.
