    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental concerns. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and approval by the Secretary of the Interior and Congress. The NEPA requires environmental considerations in the planning process. The planning process for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters is governed by the OCSLA and NEPA. The program includes a PEIS to assess environmental impacts and consider alternatives. Public comments are addressed in the PEIS and final program. The finalized program cannot be revised without restarting the process, but scheduled sales could be canceled based on environmental review requirements. The final program for 2017-2022 was approved in January 2017. The final program for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters for 2017-2022 schedules 11 lease sales on the OCS, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Congress plays a role in the planning process by submitting public comments, evaluating the program in oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to influence the program's terms. The 114th Congress influenced the proposed 2017-2022 offshore oil and gas leasing program through legislation. The report discusses the legal framework, development process, and congressional oversight related to the program. In 1953, Congress enacted laws addressing jurisdiction and rights off the U.S. coasts. The Submerged Lands Act and OCSLA defined coastal states' entitlements and the OCS. The OCSLA defined submerged lands seaward of state coastal waters under US jurisdiction for expedited development of OCS resources while maintaining environmental safeguards and national energy goals. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added provisions for leasing programs to meet energy needs for five-year periods through competitive bidding and leasing processes. The OCSLA defined submerged lands seaward of state coastal waters for OCS resource development with environmental safeguards. The 1978 amendments introduced leasing programs for five-year periods through competitive bidding. Subsequent legislative actions shaped five-year programs, including royalty relief, Gulf of Mexico leasing, revenue sharing, and removal of leasing restrictions in certain OCS regions. The OCSLA defined submerged lands for OCS resource development with environmental safeguards. Legislative actions shaped five-year programs, including royalty relief, Gulf of Mexico leasing, and removal of leasing restrictions in certain OCS regions. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of OCSLA directs the Secretary to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program to meet national energy needs while considering economic, social, and environmental values. The OCSLA requires a balanced approach to gas exploration and production in different regions, considering various factors like geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws. Leasing under the five-year program must ensure fair market value and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. Consultation with federal agencies and state governors is also mandated during program preparation. The OCSLA mandates consultation with state governors and federal agencies during the preparation of a proposed program for gas exploration and production. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to the governor of each affected state for comments at least 60 days before publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission can also submit comments on competition effects. The final five-year program must be approved by the Secretary after consultation with Congress and the President. The Secretary can revise the program at any time, with significant revisions requiring a similar approval process. The OCSLA mandates consultation with state governors and federal agencies during the preparation of a proposed program for gas exploration and production. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to the governor of each affected state for comments at least 60 days before publication in the Federal Register. The final five-year program must be approved by the Secretary after consultation with Congress and the President. BOEM carries out the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior with respect to the five-year program. Regulations require BOEM to consult with governors and consider specific laws, goals, and policies during program preparation. NEPA and CZMA also play a role in the program's formation, requiring detailed environmental impact statements and alternatives for major federal actions. Under the OCSLA, consultation with state governors and federal agencies is required for gas exploration and production programs. The final five-year program must be approved by the Secretary after consultation with Congress and the President. BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS concurrently with the five-year program, assuming its significant impact on the environment. The CZMA encourages states to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. Approved state programs are eligible for federal support. State coastal zone management programs approved by the Secretary of Commerce are eligible for federal assistance. These programs must designate conservation measures, address water pollution sources, and be considered in BOEM's leasing program development. BOEM requests information from governors and the Secretary of Commerce on the relationship between state programs and OCS oil and gas activities. The five-year program development process involves multiple drafts for review by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. The five-year program development process involves multiple drafts for review by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each step includes public comment, environmental review, and consultation requirements. The initial draft proposes lease sales in planning areas, with subsequent drafts narrowing down the proposed sales based on targeted analysis. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) initiates the development of a new five-year program by publishing a Request for Information (RFI) to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. The draft proposed program (DPP) is then published based on analysis and public comments, with proposed lease sales in planning areas. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) publishes a draft proposed program (DPP) for lease sales in the upcoming five-year period, analyzing all available OCS planning areas and identifying areas proposed for lease sales. The DPP for 2017-2022 was published on January 29, 2015, with over 1 million comments received. Following this, BOEM issues a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) and seeks public input. After further analysis and consideration of public comments, BOEM publishes a proposed program (PP) for the five-year period. After receiving public comments on the DPP, BOEM refines proposed locations and timing for OCS oil and gas lease sales in the proposed program (PP) for the 2017-2022 period. The PP is accompanied by a draft PEIS analyzing OCS areas identified for leasing. The final document, the Proposed Final Program (PFP), is based on additional analysis and public comments, announced in the Federal Register, and submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The PFP for 2017-2022 was published on November 18, 2016. BOEM published the PFP for 2017-2022 on November 18, 2016, along with a final PEIS submitted to the President and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior approved the final program on January 17, 2017, following a 60-day review period. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress, reflecting different presidential administrations' offshore oil and gas leasing policies. The Obama Administration submitted the 2012-2017 five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program to Congress, including 15 proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The George W. Bush Administration had previously submitted the 2007-2012 program with a schedule of 21 sales. The Obama Administration submitted a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program to Congress in 2012, with 15 proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The program replaced the 2007-2012 schedule of 21 sales with 16 sales, of which 11 were held before the program expired in June 2012. This was part of a series of leasing programs dating back to 1992, each with varying numbers of proposed sales and held sales before expiration. The offshore oil and gas leasing programs from 1980 to 1997 were presented to Congress under different administrations, reflecting their energy policies. The programs included multiple lease sales, with varying numbers held before expiration. The 1980 energy program, directed by former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, was approved in June 1980 with 36 proposed sales. Prior to 1980, over 3,000 tracts were leased from 1954 to 1980. In 2016, BOEM released the final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil and natural gas production declined from FY2010 to FY2015, with offshore production representing a smaller percentage of total U.S. production. However, total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production increased significantly during this period due to the rise in shale gas and shale oil production in unconventional onshore formations. This surge in production has helped reduce imports. The increased U.S. oil production has reduced imports, particularly from OPEC countries. Onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs compared to deepwater plays. There are 917 producing offshore oil and gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS. The EIA predicts lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects from 2015-2020. ONRR estimates lower bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years. The Office of Management and Budget's estimated bonus bid revenues were around $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019, but in the most recent FY2017 budget request, they were closer to $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. Crude oil production on federal lands, especially offshore, is expected to continue making a significant contribution to the U.S. energy supply. The EIA anticipates record levels of offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017, with new deepwater oil projects coming online. BOEM emphasizes the importance of energy diversification, including continued oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil and gas exploration and production proceed in stages. Oil and gas exploration and production proceed in stages, with increasing data providing certainty about the volume of resources present. Reserves are reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the U.S. OCS estimated to have 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. OCS also contains estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources of 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS, and only modest oil reserves have been reported on the Alaska OCS. The Gulf of Mexico contains 54% of the UTRR for oil and 43% for natural gas, with the majority in the Central Gulf. Alaska's UTRR estimates are mainly in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM considers resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts in OCS region planning. Some U.S. OCS areas were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. The Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA) placed a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico's Eastern and Central planning areas until 2022. President Obama also withdrew certain ocean areas in Alaska from leasing, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also protected from future leasing activities. President Obama further withdrew much of the U.S. Arctic from leasing, including the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea planning areas. The President's December 2016 withdrawals included the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and North Bering Sea planning areas, as well as certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program but will affect future leasing considerations. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each ocean region based on various criteria, resulting in 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico region. The 2017-2022 leasing program includes a total of 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, excluding the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The Gulf region is the most mature with abundant oil and gas resources, accounting for 97% of U.S. offshore production. The majority of lease sales are scheduled in the Gulf region due to industry interest and support from Gulf states. The 2017-2022 leasing program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico region, with region-wide sales offering all available lease blocks. The program schedules fewer lease sales compared to previous programs, aiming to provide greater flexibility to industry and better planning for exploring resources. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreasing summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season. Estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters have increased interest, despite challenges like severe weather, sea ice, and lack of infrastructure. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with federal leases, with only the Beaufort Sea having producing wells. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, are divided on expanding offshore oil and gas activities in the Arctic. The Obama Administration supported exploration while implementing safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Lease sales in the Alaska region were included in the 2012-2017 program, but were canceled in 2015 due to market conditions and low industry interest. The 2017-2022 program also included Alaska lease sales, but the final program details were not specified. BOEM removed sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, retaining only the sale for Cook Inlet due to factors like declining industry interest, existing leases, Arctic ecosystem uniqueness, and market conditions. Industry interest in Arctic OCS declined by over 90% between February and November 2016. Industry interest in the Arctic OCS declined by more than 90% between February 2016 and November 2016, leading companies to relinquish leases rather than invest further. The final program for 2017-2022 excluded lease sales in the Atlantic region, which had not seen oil and gas activity in the past 30 years. President Obama also withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration. The lack of oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years was due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria on offshore leasing. Changes in 2009 allowed for potential lease sales, but none have occurred. Certain parts of the Atlantic are under presidential moratorium again as of December 2016. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) analyzed factors such as ecological concerns, competing land uses, and local opposition to drilling in the Atlantic region. Despite initial plans for a lease sale in 2021, BOEM removed the Atlantic sale due to conflicts with existing ocean uses, market dynamics, and feedback from affected states. The lack of historical offshore mineral production in the Atlantic raised concerns among stakeholders. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to concerns about competing ocean uses and the current U.S. energy situation. The Pacific region also has no lease sales scheduled, with restrictions on offshore drilling in place for the past 30 years. Congress can influence the development of a five-year program in various ways. Members of Congress can influence the Administration's five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. The 114th Congress engaged in these actions for the 2017-2022 program. The 115th Congress may also address the program through legislation. Stakeholders, including Members of Congress, state governors, agencies, and the public, can submit comments on draft programs. BOEM received multiple comments from Members of Congress on the 2017-2022 program. After receiving comments from Members of Congress on the 2017-2022 program, BOEM considers these comments when developing successive drafts of a five-year program. Each draft includes an appendix summarizing the comments received and BOEM's responses. The House or Senate may hold oversight hearings to evaluate the proposed program, providing an opportunity for BOEM to hear Members' views. After BOEM released the DPP for 2017-2022, hearings were held by the House and Senate to discuss issues such as lease sales in the Atlantic and Arctic, seismic surveying, and targeted lease sales in Alaska. Congress may enact legislation to modify the program, with bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 considered in the 114th Congress, although none were enacted. H.R. 1487 and S. 791 proposed using a previous Bush Administration draft program for oil and gas leasing for FY2015-FY2020. The bills required lease sales, including one in the Atlantic region, and mandated regular lease sales every 270 days in areas with commercial interest. The bills also approved the program under NEPA without further environmental review. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 and added lease sales in the Alaska region. The bill, H.R. 3682, proposed adding new areas for oil and gas leasing in the Alaska region, Virginia coast, and other OCS areas with significant reserves. It aimed to increase production by 2032 and required BOEM to include specific goals in its five-year programs. Additionally, the bill included state revenue-sharing provisions and amendments to the OCSLA. The bill aimed to amend the OCSLA to allow the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs, including lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. It also included provisions for revenue sharing with states and the organization of DOI ocean energy agencies. Additionally, the bill directed the Secretary to conduct lease sales off North Carolina and other areas with significant oil and gas resources. The bills aimed to expand leasing programs to include areas with oil and gas resources, such as the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Alaska's Cook Inlet, and the Beaufort Sea. They also proposed revenue sharing with states and extending lease terms. Senate hearings were held on the bills in 2015. S. 1279 and S. 3203 aimed to expand leasing programs in the South Atlantic, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas, with provisions for military conflicts, state consultations, and revenue sharing. Senate hearings were held on these bills in 2015 and 2016. During the 60-day review period, Congress could introduce legislation to alter the leasing program. For example, in the 112th Congress, Representative Doc Hastings introduced a bill to replace the submitted program with a congressionally developed plan. The bill included additional lease sales in various regions but did not become law. Similar legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to make changes to the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, with potential consideration in the 115th Congress."
