    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001\". Congress finds that full and active participants in the Partnership for Peace should be invited to become full NATO members, as stated in the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Additionally, the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 called for the prompt admission of several countries to NATO to promote economic stability and security in the region. In 1998, Congress declared that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO. At the Madrid Summit in 1997, these countries were invited to join the Alliance in the first round of NATO enlargement. At the Washington Summit in April 1999, NATO declared its intention to continue welcoming new members who can uphold the principles of the Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. The Alliance expects to extend further invitations to European democratic countries willing and able to fulfill the objectives of membership. In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, several Central and Eastern European countries declared their joint effort to seek NATO membership in the next round of enlargement. President George W. Bush emphasized the importance of security and freedom for all European democracies in a speech in Warsaw, Poland in June 2001. Former President William J. Clinton and President George W. Bush both expressed support for NATO membership for all European democracies seeking it, emphasizing the importance of shared responsibilities and security. They both rejected the idea of using nations as pawns and emphasized the need to advance the cause of freedom in Europe. Clinton stated that NATO should remain open to all emerging democracies without automatic exclusion, while Bush highlighted the joint effort of Central and Eastern European countries to seek NATO membership. Congress reaffirms its support for NATO enlargement as expressed in previous acts and declarations, endorsing further enlargement of the alliance. Slovakia is designated to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994.
