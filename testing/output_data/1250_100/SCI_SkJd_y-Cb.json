    "content": "Word embeddings extract semantic features of words using a log-bilinear model. Word2net replaces this linear parametrization with neural networks, allowing for the incorporation of additional meta-data like syntactic features. By sharing parameters across word networks, word2net improves performance in predicting held-out words and learns interpretable semantic representations. Word2net is a method that uses neural networks to extract semantic features of words and incorporates syntactic information. It outperforms popular embedding methods in predicting heldout words and can share parameters based on part of speech to further boost performance. Additionally, word2net learns interpretable semantic representations compared to vector-based methods. Word embeddings are a statistical tool for analyzing language by learning vector representations of vocabulary based on the distributional hypothesis. Most embeddings rely on a log-bilinear model, but word2net introduces a method that relaxes this linear assumption. Word2net is a word embedding method that introduces non-linear interaction effects between co-occurring words, leading to a better model of language. It replaces word vectors with term-specific neural networks, allowing for sharing parameters based on part-of-speech tags. The word2net objective involves the probability of a binary variable w n based on its context in U.S. Senate speeches. It focuses on the position of the word and its surrounding words, such as verbs like \"decrease\" and nouns like \"cut.\" The method uses a neural network to compute similarities between word representations, capturing semantic and syntactic similarities. The word2net model captures semantic and syntactic similarities by utilizing word embeddings. Parameter sharing in word2net outperforms word2vec and standard Bernoulli embeddings. Deep Bernoulli embeddings show better predictive log-likelihood compared to other methods. Various extensions and variants of word embeddings exist, with most relying on a log-bilinear model. Our model differs by having a separate network for each vocabulary word. The word2net model utilizes word embeddings to capture semantic and syntactic similarities. It incorporates side information in specific network layers and adopts exponential family embeddings to extend word embeddings beyond text data. The model consists of a single network that outputs logits for all words in the vocabulary, allowing for faster optimization. The conditional probability of a word is determined by a multi-layer network that takes the context as input and reweights latent features for prediction. The word2net model incorporates syntactic information into word embeddings, specifically focusing on nouns. It uses a multi-layer network to reweight latent features for prediction, outperforming other embedding methods on predicting held-out words. The model's performance was studied using datasets from Wikipedia articles and U.S. Senate speeches. Word2net outperforms popular embedding methods in predicting held-out words by incorporating syntactic information and using separate networks for each vocabulary word. This approach helps maintain the objective as a bank of binary classifiers, leading to faster performance. Word2net extends exponential family embeddings to incorporate non-linear relationships and leverage syntactic information for improved word representations. It introduces a novel extension of Bernoulli embeddings, which are related to word2vec and capture semantic properties while enhancing syntactic information. Exponential family embeddings in word2vec encode semantic properties of words and parameterize conditional probabilities based on context. Bernoulli embeddings, a type of exponential family embedding, do not impose constraints on computational complexity. In Bernoulli embeddings, the goal is to learn embedding vectors and context vectors from text by maximizing the log probability of words given their contexts. The objective function is a sum of log probabilities for all instances and vocabulary words, forming a bank of binary classifiers. Context vectors couple the classifiers together, with the objective being V independent logistic regressors predicting word appearance in a given context. Negative sampling is used to downweight zeros or subsample negative examples. Replacing vectors with neural networks in word2net objective has implications for model capacity and overfitting risk. The bank of binary classifiers gains capacity to capture nonlinear relationships between context and cooccurrence probabilities, while increasing parameters may lead to overfitting. Regularization techniques such as weight decay and parameter sharing are used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Word2net outperforms shallow models in fitting text data and capturing semantic similarities. Parameter sharing allows for the hierarchical structure of neural network representations to be exploited, enabling the use of tags for regularization. Each word is assigned to a group for parameter sharing, where different occurrences of a term may belong to different groups. Sharing specific layers of word networks among words in the same group helps in regularization. In neural network representations, parameter sharing can be applied at different layers to prevent overfitting. This structure does not require side information and can be used on any text corpus. When annotated with tags, parameter sharing can improve word embeddings by capturing semantic structures. Sharing specific layers among words in the same group helps in regularization and enhances the capability of word2net. The main issue in improving word embeddings is the ambiguity of words with different tags, which requires capturing differences in contexts. Parameter sharing in neural network representations can enhance word embeddings by incorporating tag information, improving regularization and semantic structure capture. Parameter sharing in neural network representations can improve word embeddings by incorporating tag information, reducing the number of parameters needed to describe layers and enhancing semantic similarity. This approach extends to side information beyond tags, focusing on sharing parameters across all words or tags. Word2net replaces word vectors with word networks to compute semantic similarities. Each word is represented by a neural network, and similarity is measured by comparing outputs across networks using cosine distances. The procedure involves evaluating outputs on a set of inputs and comparing the results. Word2net uses neural networks to represent words and compute semantic similarities by comparing outputs using cosine distances. It outperforms existing models on datasets like Wikipedia articles and Senate speeches, capturing semantic and syntactic information effectively. The text8 corpus is a collection of Wikipedia articles with 17M words, forming a vocabulary of 15K common terms. Senate speeches dataset contains 24M words, with a vocabulary of 15K terms. Both datasets are annotated using taggers and split into training, validation, and test sets. Comparison is made with the BID11 model and skip-gram model. The shallow models compared have 2K parameters per term, with experiments conducted on context sizes of 2, 4, and 8. Training methods include stochastic gradient descent with negative samples, regularization, weight decay, and Adam optimization. Training stops when validation loss increases, and context vectors are initialized from a pretrained Bernoulli embedding. Word2net, a model with Bernoulli embedding and parameter sharing schemes, outperforms skip-gram in predictive performance. Different model sizes and parameter sharing approaches are explored, showing improved results on the Wikipedia dataset. Word2net outperforms skip-gram in predictive performance, especially with parameter sharing. The model shows improved results on the Wikipedia dataset, with better predictions compared to other methods. Additionally, word2net captures similarities and leverages syntactic information effectively. TAB3 displays the similarity between word networks trained on Wikipedia with parameter sharing at layer D 1, compared to word embeddings. The table shows that word2net can capture latent semantics, even for less frequent words. TAB4 shows similarities of models trained on Senate speeches, highlighting word2net's superiority in incorporating syntactic information into learned representations. The text discusses word2net, a method for learning neural network representations of words. It mentions using word networks to predict word occurrences in context windows and improving prediction accuracy. Parameter sharing is introduced as a way to share statistical strength across groups of words, showing improved performance. Future research directions include exploring different ways of combining context information and types of parameter sharing. Additional results are presented in TAB5, comparing word2net with competing models. TAB5 compares the test log-likelihood of word2net with skip-gram and other models on the Wikipedia dataset. Word2net performs similarly to skip-gram without parameter sharing but improves with part-of-speech parameter sharing. TAB6 shows test log-likelihood for U.S. Senate speeches, where skip-gram is outperformed by word2net with parameter sharing. Word2vec is widely used for word vector representations, with choices in objectives and scalable algorithms like negative sampling. Bernoulli embeddings BID19 are compared to negative sampling and skip-gram. Bernoulli embeddings use an unbiased estimate for the summation over negative examples, with an auxiliary coefficient. The differences include a regularization term in Bernoulli embeddings and the need to draw new negative samples at each iteration. In contrast to Bernoulli embeddings, negative sampling and skip-gram use fixed negative samples drawn in advance. Both approaches show similar performance for large datasets. Negative sampling breaks the multi-class constraint and models probabilities of individual words. The skip-gram objective is to predict context from the target word."
