    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1998\". Adjudication of claims is addressed in the Act. The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq, applying applicable law and principles of justice. Priority is given to non-commercial claims related to Iraq's actions against U.S. Armed Forces. The International Claims Settlement Act applies where not inconsistent with this Act. The International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 applies to claims under this Act, as authorized by the United States Commission to receive and determine claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of claims. Funds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for the payment of claims, with a limitation on the amount allocated for US Government claims. The term \"certified claims of the United States Government\" refers to claims determined by the Secretary of State to be valid and outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission, with certified amounts established by the President's procedures. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Reimbursement for administrative expenses will be deducted from the Iraq Claims Fund. Payments will be made accordingly. The United States Commission certifies awards under section 2, with payments made from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. This includes payment of $10,000 or the award's principal amount, additional payments for claims with priority, and pro rata payments for all awards' unpaid balances. Accrued interest is also paid after the principal amounts are settled. After full payment of awards from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the US Treasury. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER RECORDS. The head of any Executive agency may transfer records to the United States Commission for adjudication. SEC. 8. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; DISPOSITION OF UNUSED FUNDS. The statute of limitations for certified awards under this Act is one year after the publication of a notice in the Federal Register. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish a notice after 9 years, identifying unpaid claims. Unused funds must be disposed of within 2 years of the notice publication date. The Iraq Claims Fund balance must be deposited in the Treasury if not used for additional payments. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\""
