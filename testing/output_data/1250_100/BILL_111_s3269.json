    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that teenage drivers between 15 and 20 years of age have a significantly higher fatality rate in motor vehicle crashes compared to drivers between 25 and 70 years of age. Additionally, teenage drivers account for over one-third of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in. Teenage drivers have a higher fatality rate in motor vehicle crashes compared to older drivers. Nearly two-thirds of fatalities in these crashes involve other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The presence of peers in the vehicle increases the risk of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers. Cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers' performance. More than 50% of crash fatalities involving teenage drivers occur at night. The implementation of Florida's graduated driver licensing system in 1997 reduced fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers. The Journal of the American Medical Association and the National Transportation Safety Board report a decrease in crashes among teenage drivers aged 15-18. States like Michigan, North Carolina, and California saw reductions in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers after implementing graduated driver licensing systems. Over 40 states have adopted similar systems to improve teenage driver safety. Many states have not fully implemented safety features of graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers. A 2001 Harris Poll shows strong support for requirements such as practice driving hours with an adult, a learner's permit period, and limits on teenage passengers and supervised driving during high-risk periods.

SEC. 3. STATE GRADUATED DRIVER LICENSING LAWS. A State is compliant with this section if it has a graduated driver licensing law for novice drivers under 21, requiring a 2-stage process before getting an unrestricted license. The process includes a learner's permit stage starting at 16, lasting at least 6 months, prohibiting cellphone use, night driving, and remaining until the intermediate stage begins. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing law for novice drivers under 21 includes a 6-month duration, prohibits cellphone use, night driving, limits non-familial passengers under 21, and remains in effect until the driver turns 18. The Secretary of Transportation may require additional conditions for learner's permits, including 40 hours of training with a licensed driver over 21, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver while operating a vehicle. Additionally, the grant of an unrestricted driver's license may be delayed for novice drivers under 21. The Secretary of Transportation may delay the issuance of a driver's license for individuals convicted of driving-related offenses during the learner's permit or intermediate stage. The Secretary will establish regulations for implementing this rule. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment. States must submit an application with certification from the Governor. Grant amounts are determined based on the appropriation for each fiscal year. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment. States must submit an application with certification from the Governor. Grant amounts are determined based on the appropriation for each fiscal year. The funds received can be used for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials related to the State's graduated driver licensing law, and other administrative activities relevant to the State's licensing process. $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the Act's enactment, with $25,000,000 appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund annually for this purpose. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth year, the withholding increases to 5 percent, and from the sixth year onwards, it will be 10 percent. The Act mandates withholding 10 percent of funds from states not compliant with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. Withheld funds are available for distribution until the end of the third fiscal year following appropriation. Funds withheld after the sixth fiscal year cannot be distributed to the state. If a State comes into compliance with section 3(a) before the last day of the period for which funds were withheld, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute the remaining withheld amounts to the State. The distributed funds will be available for expenditure by the State until the end of the third fiscal year following the year of apportionment, after which any unspent amount will revert back to the Treasury of the United States. If any amount withheld under subsection (a) is not distributed to the State under subsection (b), it will revert back to the Treasury of the United States."
