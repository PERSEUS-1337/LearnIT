    "content": "Human-driven climate change has shifted from a scientific topic to a policy debate, with Congressional proposals focusing on observation, pollution control, financial assistance for technology, and adaptation. Federal funding for climate change activities was $6.37 billion in FY2008, with a total impact of $7.73 billion including tax incentives. Funding for FY2009 remains at or below these levels, with a Continuing Resolution in place. Tax incentives for renewable energy passed in late 2008 may have affected budgetary impacts in FY2009. In 2008, uncertainty affected budgetary impacts of incentives. The 111th Congress evaluates past funding and future priorities for climate change. President Obama aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has appointed Carol Browner for Energy and Climate Change. Funding proposals and program alignment under new leadership remain uncertain. President George W. Bush set goals to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas intensity and emissions, with a focus on advancing clean technologies and regulatory measures. Funding proposals have been loosely tied to climate policy goals, with specific performance targets set for some programs. President Bush aimed to halt emissions increases by 2025, with a shift towards declining emissions through technological advancements. The Obama Administration and Congress may need to consider clearer relationships among programs, funding, and contributions to climate change goals, especially if greenhouse gas targets are legislated. The appropriations process has not facilitated a broad view of climate change policy goals and priorities, requiring greater coordination across subcommittees. The report describes federal funding of climate change activities across 14 agencies, with a focus on changes from FY2007 and FY2008 levels to President Bush's FY2009 request. Funding information remains unclear, hindering full understanding of the federal effort and its effectiveness. The estimates provided in the report should be viewed with caution due to limited political agreement. The report highlights the limited political agreement surrounding climate change in the United States, leading to a focus on research and international assistance. There is a historic emphasis on climate change science, with concerns raised about the need for more concrete actions. Despite uncertainties, continued scientific research on climate change and adaptation strategies is deemed necessary. Funding levels for climate change activities across federal agencies are also discussed. Funding for climate change increased rapidly from 1989 to 1995 but has generally declined since then. Scenario analyses in the mid-1990s showed that major changes in energy and technologies were needed to avoid human-induced climate change. Federal support for clean technologies emerged as a consensus, with programs like the Climate Change Technology Initiative and Climate Change Technology Program being established. These technology programs now make up about two-thirds of all climate change funding. Developing countries are also recognized as needing support. In 1992, the United States and other developed countries committed to providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries to adopt less emitting economic paths. President George H.W. Bush established a $25 million Country Studies Program to help countries assess and implement climate change policies. Funding for international assistance, mainly through US AID, has declined since the late 1990s due to various reasons. This report provides an overview of climate change funding in science, technology, and international assistance areas, as well as tax provisions that may encourage greenhouse gas reductions. The report provides preliminary analysis of federal funding for climate change programs, categorizing it by type of activity or technology supported. It identifies legislative issues related to funding and shows budget authority for FY2001-FY2008. The Bush Administration grouped funding into Climate Change Science, Technology, and International Assistance programs, with funding levels fluctuating over the years. The report analyzes federal funding for climate change programs, categorizing it by activity or technology supported. Funding levels fluctuated over the years, with notable increases in FY2008 and FY2009 for new satellites, nuclear energy, and international technology financing. The federal government also offers tax incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, with estimated tax expenditures of $1.52 billion in FY2008 and FY2007. The report analyzes federal funding for climate change programs, categorizing it by activity or technology supported. Funding levels fluctuated over the years, with notable increases in FY2008 and FY2009 for new satellites, nuclear energy, and international technology financing. Tax expenditures related to climate change include credits for cleaner automobiles and renewable electricity generation technologies. The total budgetary impact of reported climate change activities has increased nearly 85% from FY2001 to the enacted FY2008 level. The budgetary impact of climate change activities increased by nearly 85% from FY2001 to FY2008. Funding for technology research and development accounts for over 60% of this increase, with an additional $1.5 billion allocated for tax incentives. President Bush's FY2009 budget request aimed to bring funding levels back to FY2001 levels in real terms, with a proposed increase of 12.3% to $7.15 billion. A Continuing Resolution extended FY2008 funding levels through March 6, 2009 for most climate-related programs. The FY2009 budget requested changes in funding levels for various climate change purposes, including increased funding for nuclear energy research and demonstrations, fossil energy research and development for carbon capture and storage technologies, and satellite sensors for climate-related measurements. Additionally, tax incentives for renewable energy investments were extended in late 2008, potentially impacting estimated impacts for FY2009. The FY2009 budget proposed funding changes for climate change initiatives, including a $400 million initial installment to a Clean Technology Fund. However, the emphasis on researching climate change impacts and adaptation was not evident in the documentation. Most proposed increases focused on observational capacities and basic technological research, with reductions in funding for programs on impacts and adaptation. Additionally, some programs previously funded by Congress were not continued in the FY2009 proposal. The FY2009 budget proposed changes for climate change initiatives, with funding grouped into three program areas by OMB. These areas include Climate Change Science Program, Climate Change Technology Program, and International Climate Change Assistance. The focus of funding has been on technology research, demonstration, and deployment, with a significant increase in budget for FY2009 compared to FY2007. The FY2009 budget proposed significant funding increases for climate change initiatives, with a focus on technology research and nuclear energy. The requested $400 million for the Clean Technology Fund would have led to a 325% increase in international assistance funding. However, specific uses of climate change funds are often unclear, making it challenging to determine how the funding is allocated. The FY2009 budget proposed significant funding increases for climate change initiatives, with a focus on technology research and nuclear energy. Two categories, nuclear energy research and demonstrations, and satellite-based observations, received the largest shares of requested funding. Nuclear energy research would receive an estimated $1.40 billion (19.6%) in the FY2009 request, while satellite-based observations would constitute about 11.8% of all federal climate change funding. Funding for nuclear energy technology research would be about 30% of the funding requested for climate change technologies. The FY2009 budget proposed significant funding increases for climate change initiatives, with a focus on technology research and nuclear energy. The budget allocated funds to the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Space and Aeronautics Administration (NASA), totaling 74% of the climate change request. The report describes the three major climate change program areas and highlights the FY2009 request, including science, technology, international assistance, and tax provisions for greenhouse gas reductions. Discussions of funding by agency for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) are included in the appendices. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has been managing scientific research on climate change since 2003. President Bush requested $2.08 billion for climate change science in FY2009, an increase from previous years. The funding would be distributed to 11 federal agencies, with NASA receiving the largest share. The history of U.S. funding for climate change science since FY1989 is also presented. The CCSP budget for climate change science declined by 11% from FY2001 to FY2008 in constant dollars, down 25% from the peak in FY1995. NASA's climate-related budget decreased by 24% from FY2000 to FY2008, with a proposed increase for space-based observations in FY2009. This reflects a shift in funds within agencies due to budget constraints and priorities for space exploration. In the FY2001 to FY2008 period, only NOAA's budget increased by 217%, while other agencies saw declines in climate science budgets. Federal research on climate change has a long history, with funding peaking in FY1995 at $2.28 billion. Budget constraints and space program cost over-runs have impacted agencies' ability to fund climate change research. Following the peak funding in FY1995 of $2.28 billion for climate change science, funds generally declined to $1.83 billion enacted for FY2008. The Global Change Research Act established the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which aimed to improve understanding of uncertainties in climate science and support policymaking and resource management. The U.S. Global Change Research Program aims to improve understanding of climate science, support policymaking, and communicate findings broadly. However, a review highlighted a focus on physical science over behavioral, economic, and ecological aspects of environmental issues. Key areas lacking include ecosystem-scale research, adaptation research, and integrated assessments for public policy implications. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has faced criticism for focusing on physical science over other aspects of environmental issues. Critics argue that structural changes are needed as current efforts have been largely unsuccessful. Proposals to restructure and expand climate change research are being considered within and outside of the U.S. Congress. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has not been formalized through legislation, with the Global Change Research Act remaining the principal legal authorization for federal climate change science. The CCSP, described in the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, has faced criticism for its focus on physical science. Proposals for restructuring and expanding climate change research are being considered in Congress. The 2003 and 2008 CCSP Strategic Plans grouped research into seven elements and laid out five goals. The proposed FY2009 funding for each goal is provided. The proposed FY2009 funding for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) goals is as follows: Goal 1 ($410.6 million) focuses on improving knowledge of Earth's climate and environment. Goal 2 ($314.8 million) aims to quantify forces causing climate changes. Goal 3 ($279.8 million) seeks to reduce uncertainty in future climate projections. Goal 4 ($160.0 million) aims to understand ecosystem sensitivity to climate change. Goal 5 ($143.8 million) explores managing risks and opportunities related to climate variability. Funding excludes satellite-based observations and other federal climate-related science activities. The Global Change Research Program faces reporting issues due to absorbing the CCSP, making it challenging to track federal funding for climate change science. Proposed funding focuses on satellite-based observations, basic science research, and climate models. The Global Change Research Act mandates scientific assessments every four years and annual reports on climate change activities and budget. The Bush Administration aimed to produce synthesis and assessment products. The Bush Administration aimed to produce synthesis and assessment products to meet the reporting requirements of the Global Change Research Act. Environmental groups disagreed with the planned reports and filed a lawsuit, leading to the release of the Revised Research Plan in 2008. This plan focused on the period from 2008 to 2010 and set the stage for a new strategy by 2010. The 2008 Revised Research Plan (RRP) retains the same goals and structure as the 2003 Strategy. It focuses on providing physical science to understand Earth's climate, addressing research needs for impacts of climate change, and supporting decision-making for climate management. There is an increased emphasis on generating scientific results at regional and local scales and communicating with users. The CCSP will focus on communicating with stakeholders and users to ensure research results are widely accessible. The Congress may consider legislative options for federal climate change research. The CCSP will produce a Unified Synthesis Product to analyze current understanding of climate change. The CCSP aims to analyze current understanding of climate change science, summarize contributions, and identify gaps. Concerns include weaknesses in leadership and budget coherence, with reviews suggesting a lack of overarching authority. Calls for strengthening central leadership through legislative actions have been made. Options for strengthening central leadership of the CCSP through legislative actions include various federal entities such as the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the National Science Foundation, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Suggestions have been made for a \"climate czar\" in the White House or a new standalone entity. Questions have been raised about whether this leadership should cover all climate change programs, including energy security coordination. President Obama appointed Carol Browner as Assistant for Energy and Climate Change. Obama appointed Carol Browner as his Assistant for Energy and Climate Change, potentially filling a leadership role in the CCSP. One challenge facing the program is the lack of clearly defined and measurable goals, making it difficult to assess progress and prioritize resources effectively. This issue highlights the tension between funding for fundamental knowledge and the need for applied research to achieve climate change policy objectives. A National Academies panel has been convened to address how to measure progress within the CCSP. The CCSP Strategic Plan lacks measurable goals, making it challenging to assess progress. Metrics could be developed, but it is costly and challenging to implement them for all program elements. A 2008 review by the National Academies relied on qualitative assessments due to the absence of detailed management metrics. The Government Accountability Office highlighted data and reporting limitations in determining agencies' actual levels of funding. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found challenges in determining agencies' actual levels of climate change funding due to data and reporting limitations. Despite some improvements from GAO recommendations, fundamental issues of lack of clarity and consistency persist, hindering evaluation of fund application efficiency. A 2007 National Academies panel and a 2008 National Research Council report also highlighted the lack of detailed budget and management information for evaluating climate change programs, particularly in space-based observations. The assessment highlighted the need for a balance between space-based and other research components to improve the value of observations. It emphasized the importance of integrating observations from land, sea, air, and space into forecast models for decision-making. The top priority for improvement was continuous observations, and strong observation systems must be effectively analyzed and applied. Resources should focus on sustained observations, complementary non-space-based observations, turning observations into knowledge, and sustaining operations. The NRC panel recommended balancing funding for satellite-based observations with other observation systems and increasing analysis of gathered information. There is a tension between acquiring new knowledge and practical benefits in climate change science, with a focus on observing and understanding global change rather than providing useful information to policymakers. The emphasis has been on supporting basic research according to agency missions, as seen in the CCSP budget analysis. The author discusses the need for changes in the operating norms of oversight committees in carbon cycle science to focus more on societal needs. A 2007 study by the National Research Council emphasized the importance of involving users in determining priorities and evaluating benefits for NASA products. The National Academies panel evaluated the progress of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and highlighted the need for direct user involvement in setting priorities and designing products. The panel concluded in 2007 that adjustments are needed in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program to achieve its vision. Various proposals have been suggested to restructure the program, including giving more authority to one agency or the White House, increasing budget control, involving potential users of the science, and improving budget decision-making. Some proposals aim to expand the program to include more applied research and analysis for private and government needs, as well as enhance public communications and outreach. Several bills in the 110th Congress would address these proposals. President Clinton and President Bush initiated climate technology programs in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to the establishment of the U.S. Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) in 2005 under the Energy Policy Act. The program aimed to promote the deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies and practices through research and development. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) to promote the deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies and practices. The program includes preparing inventories, evaluations, technology demonstration projects, and developing standards for monitoring and analyzing GHG intensity. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) focuses on standards and best practices for calculating, monitoring, and analyzing GHG intensity, supporting demonstration projects, and entering into research agreements. It aims to accelerate technological advances for reducing, avoiding, capturing, and storing man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The program does not have specific targets for emissions reduction but outlines six strategic goals for advancing technology development. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) aims to reduce emissions from energy end-use and infrastructure, improve capabilities to measure and monitor GHG emissions, and increase federal funding for climate change technology. Funding for climate change technology has significantly increased over the years, with President Bush's FY2009 budget requesting a $114 million increase above FY2008. However, tracking the evolution of specific climate change initiatives has become challenging due to redefinitions by agencies and OMB. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) funding has increased over the years, but tracking specific initiatives is challenging due to redefinitions by agencies and OMB. GAO has noted discrepancies in technology funding reporting, making it difficult to compare funding trends. 29% of FY2009 CCTP funds would support nuclear energy. In FY2009, 29% of the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) funds would support nuclear energy, equivalent to 20% of all funding for climate change activities. Funding for nuclear energy research would be more than twice the amount requested for any other technology category. Other significant categories include programs supporting multiple technologies or unspecified technologies (13%) and funding for renewable energy technologies excluding biomass and biofuels (12%). The Administration's priorities for specific technologies planned for development by DOE and EPA under the CCTP are highlighted in a table in Appendix F. Rapid technological change is necessary to effectively stabilize greenhouse gas emissions globally. The U.S. technology strategy has been focused on federal sponsorship of research on specified technologies, but there is no clear link between federal investment and commercial success. There are various public incentives that influence private technology choices beyond those identified under the CCTP, which may either support or counteract climate-related investments. Efficiency in federal stimulation of technological advancement could be improved by considering all incentives as a whole and their cumulative effects. The CCTP supports technological advancement at all stages of research and development. The CCTP supports technological advance at all stages of research, development, demonstrations, and deployment. More than two-thirds of CCTP funding supports basic research and development of specific technologies. Federal programs encourage deployment of technologies through targeted information and technical assistance. Only a small portion of CCTP funding supports technology deployment in the United States. Congress appropriates funds to various agencies to promote voluntary adoption of efficient technologies that reduce greenhouse gases. The CCTP funding levels by agency for FY2008 and FY2009 are compared in Figure 7. DOE would represent 87% of the new budget authority for CCTP in FY2009, with USDA at 4%, and DOD and NASA at 3% each. EPA and NSF would receive 2% and 1% respectively. President Bush's climate change strategy also included International Climate Change Assistance to help other countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The United States aims to lead global efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions post-2012, with a focus on fulfilling commitments under the UNFCCC. Developing countries' participation hinges on support from industrialized nations. President Bush proposed a significant increase in funding for international climate change programs, emphasizing the US's responsibility in addressing climate change. The US proposed a $400 million increase in funding for the Clean Technology Fund managed by the World Bank to support greenhouse gas emission reductions and climate change adaptation in developing countries. Other countries also pledged funds for the Climate Investment Funds. The Strategic Climate Fund aims to test innovative approaches to climate change, with programs focused on increasing climate resilience in developing countries. Additional programs like the Forest Investment Program and Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program are expected. The funding is intended to support existing commitments of developed countries for financial assistance to developing countries, fostering trust and engagement in new greenhouse gas mitigation efforts. President Bush's request aimed to increase international climate change assistance through USAID by $50 million, from $115 million enacted for FY2008 to a proposed $165 million in FY2009. A Continuing Resolution extended the FY2008 funding level through March 6, 2009. The requested amount would still be lower than the level of $190 million enacted for FY2006, with a decrease due to $28 million eliminated for \"modern energy services\" in Afghanistan. USAID does not distinguish funding for specific climate change actions. In FY2009, international assistance funding included $52 million for the Department of State, with $37 million supporting the Asia Pacific Partnership. Additional funding for the Partnership was requested for the Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, but both the House and Senate rejected the request to fund the Asia Pacific Partnership. This decision aligns with past appropriations, as funds for the Partnership have never been allocated to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) is a voluntary partnership involving the United States, Canada, China, India, South Korea, Australia, and Japan to advance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas intensity. Critics argue it diverts from UN cooperation, but technological advances in developing countries are crucial for reducing emissions. The United States, as a Party to the UNFCCC, committed to providing financial resources for developing countries to meet climate change obligations. In FY2009, the United States allocated $26 million for climate-related contributions to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by the World Bank. The GEF supports projects for clean energy production and efficient energy use. Additionally, the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund) was set up to assist the poorest countries in adapting to climate change, with a proposed $20 million allocation in FY2009 that was not enacted into law. The Continuing Resolution extends funding through March 6, 2009 at FY2008 levels, without explicit contribution to the LDC Fund. Parties established the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) to support adaptation, technology transfer, and economic diversification in developing countries. The United States has not contributed to the SCCF. Additionally, the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol is financed by a surcharge on emission reduction credits and voluntary contributions. The US is not obligated to contribute but may face pressure to do so. Congressional appropriations to developing countries will impact State Department assistance. The Department of State's ability to enhance U.S. credibility and engage developing countries in new GHG mitigation commitments post-2012 may be influenced by financial assistance. However, providing aid alone may not ensure that developing countries view it as measurable, reportable, and verifiable. Controversies may arise over whether financial assistance outside UNFCCC mechanisms fulfills commitments, how multilateral funds are managed, and if financing is considered \"new and additional.\" The U.S. also promotes conservation of tropical rainforests to reduce emissions and protect carbon removal by trees through debt-for-conservation swaps. The FY2009 request included $20 million for debt restructuring for tropical forestry conservation under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. Tax provisions contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by incentivizing investments in technologies emitting less than fossil fuels. OMB's estimates of tax expenditures rose sharply from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007. The estimates for tax expenditures rose sharply from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007 due to expected loss of revenues from tax incentives. OMB projected a decrease to $1.4 billion in FY2009, with further declines through 2013. The continuity of tax provisions over time poses challenges for investors in renewable energy projects, potentially reducing their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Tax incentives aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by stimulating new technologies, rather than supporting non-commercial markets. The effects of these incentives are intertwined with other tax provisions that may worsen climate change, such as support for fossil fuels. The existence of incentives for both low and high-GHG-emitting technologies may offset each other, masking the true cost of energy for consumers. Federal funding for climate change has expanded from scientific research to various programs aimed at technology development, policy foundation, and future planning. Efficiencies could be improved by revising conflicting provisions to meet multiple objectives simultaneously. Federal funding for climate change has expanded to develop and disseminate technologies, build a foundation for future policy actions, plan for adaptation, assist lower income countries, and address additional needs. The current federal effort lacks an overarching policy goal and is built \"bottom up\" from existing programs and initiatives. There is no synthesis to establish how federal funding will lead to achieving a national climate change goal. President-elect Barack Obama emphasized the need for coordination across the government to address climate change. President Obama has designated Carol Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change to coordinate government efforts. He aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is uncertainty on how funding proposals and program alignment will support these goals. The Executive Branch did not provide a consolidated annual report on climate change funding in 2008, and the absence of a cross-cut budget requirement continues into FY2009. Agencies vary in their identification and explanation of climate change activities. The absence of a cross-cut budget requirement continues into FY2009, leading to discrepancies in how agencies identify and explain climate-related activities in their budget justifications. Congress may choose to reinstate a reporting requirement for climate change funding and tax incentives to improve clarity and consistency in reporting. It may be beneficial for budget justifications to clearly outline increases and decreases in activities, stakeholders affected, and priorities to enhance transparency for decision-making. The traditional categorization of agencies' climate change efforts into science, technology, and international assistance programs may not effectively convey the objectives of all activities. A different organization of budgetary information may be necessary to meet Congress's oversight and appropriations needs, especially if annual funding or expenditure reports are required. A different organization of budgetary information may align with climate change legislation in Congress. Evaluation of funded climate change efforts is mainly at the activity level, with limited integrated assessments. The Climate Change Science Program has undergone numerous evaluations, unlike the Climate Change Technology Program. Evaluation of international assistance and foreign policy on climate change is lacking. No comprehensive evaluation of the federal effort has been conducted. Federal funding and tax incentives for climate change activities totaled $7.73 billion in FY2008, showing an 85% increase since FY2001. $2.6 billion of the increase is attributed to technology research and development, while $1.5 billion is due to new tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. Funding for climate change science decreased by 23% after adjusting for inflation. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is the Administration's research program under the Global Change Research Act. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) was established under the Global Change Research Act in 1990 with funding of $1.86 million in FY2008. It represents 29% of federal funding for climate change and 24% of the total budgetary impact. Satellite-based observing systems receive the majority of climate science funding. However, a 23% decline in funding from FY2001 to FY2008 has led to challenges in supporting satellite-based observations and other research elements. External evaluations suggest improvements are needed in leadership, budget coherence, progress metrics, reporting, balance among research elements, and practical applications of knowledge. The CCSP is revising its strategic plan for 2013-2023, with potential legislative options to clarify goals, progress measures, and organization. The federal investment in the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) has more than doubled since FY2001, reaching $4.30 billion for FY2008. Funding for nuclear energy research and development is the largest component of climate change-related programs. Stakeholders agree on the importance of advancing low-emitting technologies, but there are differing opinions on the federal balance of funding across technology types. Some emphasize the need for greater program continuity and incentives consistent with business planning cycles. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) has received increased federal investment, reaching $4.30 billion for FY2008. Stakeholders have differing opinions on funding balance across technology types, with some emphasizing the need for program continuity and incentives aligned with business planning cycles. A 2006 assessment suggested supporting exploratory and revolutionary technologies, as well as more \"enabling\" and \"integrative\" technologies. There is potential to improve federal stimulation of technological advance by strategically reviewing existing climate-related technology programs together. Additionally, evaluating technologies that stimulate greenhouse gas reductions alongside those that may aggravate emissions could lead to more efficient use of federal funds and tax incentives. Climate change funding includes international programs with an enacted amount of $202 million in FY2008, with a proposed increase by President Bush to $2 billion over five years. The challenge lies in negotiating international commitments post-2012 to address climate change and gain global engagement in greenhouse gas mitigation. Developing countries' participation depends on industrialized countries fulfilling their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including financial and technological assistance. The United States, as a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, is seen as having a significant responsibility in addressing climate change. The United States is seen as having a significant responsibility in addressing climate change globally. It committed in 1992, along with other wealthy countries, to provide financial and technological assistance to emerging economies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The US has contributed to the Global Environmental Facility but not to funds for the least developed countries. In 2008, the US Treasury committed $2 billion for the Clean Technology Fund. The United States has committed to providing financial and technological assistance to address climate change globally. At a recent meeting, several countries pledged billions of dollars for the Climate Investment Funds, but the U.S. commitment is pending Congressional approval. The U.S. role in providing assistance and cooperation with developing countries will impact its credibility and engagement in new greenhouse gas mitigation commitments. Providing assistance to developing countries may not ensure that it meets the criteria of measurable, reportable, and verifiable finance, technology, and capacity-building as required by the Bali Action Plan of 2007. There is debate over whether financial aid given outside of UNFCCC mechanisms fulfills commitments under the Convention. Controversies may arise regarding the management of multilateral funds, the definition of \"new and additional\" financing, conditions on funding, and the adequacy and predictability of funds. Tax provisions have been enacted to promote low GHG-emitting technologies, but their continuity over long periods for planning and constructing large projects like renewable energy installations is uncertain. Tax incentives for renewable energy investments faced delays in renewal in 2008, reducing their effectiveness in reducing GHG emissions. The current economic situation hinders the effectiveness of tax credits, especially for those with limited tax liability. Evaluations on the efficiency of tax incentives are lacking, leading to debates on their effectiveness compared to other mechanisms. Tax incentives for both low and high GHG-emitting technologies may offset each other, masking the true cost of energy for consumers. Executive Branch reporting on climate change expenditures focuses on tax incentives. The Executive Branch focuses on tax incentives for climate change expenditures, but lacks data on overall effects on greenhouse gas emissions. Revising tax provisions to align with multiple objectives could lead to more efficient outcomes. The lack of a unifying mission across agencies hinders a cohesive climate change strategy. The Obama Administration is expected to provide more action-oriented leadership in aligning climate-related programs for a cross-agency approach. The current focus is on aligning climate-related programs and funding across agencies to create an effective mission. There are gaps in governance infrastructure, limited resources for economic evaluations, and underfunded programs for assessing climate change impacts and adaptation planning. Efficiency opportunities exist in managing programs addressing issues like carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions estimates. The efficiency of climate change-related programs may be hindered by funding constraints and administrative requirements. Federal officials' expertise and job mobility barriers can also impact program success. Finding funds for interagency teams remains a challenge despite some adjustments. Critics argue that weaknesses still exist in federal programs. Critics argue that weaknesses in federal climate change programs persist, prompting calls for structural fixes. Proposals to restructure and expand these programs may be debated in the 111th Congress, aiming to encourage integrated strategies and minimize legislative fragmentation. With budget pressures and shifting priorities under a new administration, challenges in demonstrating program benefits and competing demands for funding may arise. Improved reporting and strategic federal funding are key considerations in addressing climate change. Improved reporting and strategic federal funding are key considerations in addressing climate change. Opportunities exist to align funding with policy goals and ensure efficient program organization. Various CRS reports provide insights on federal funding of climate change activities and related policies. The Congress did not include statutory language in the FY2008 appropriations law or in the FY2009 Continuing Resolution requiring the Administration to report to Congress on federal expenditures for climate change activities, unlike in previous years. Previous requirements for reporting on climate change obligations and expenditures were included in annual appropriations bills for foreign operations. The Appropriations Act for FY2006 (Section 585(b) of P.L. 109-102) requires the President to submit a report to Congress on climate change expenditures within 60 days after the President's Budget is transmitted. This report must detail all Federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs and activities in fiscal year 2006. The President is required to submit a report to Congress on climate change expenditures, detailing all Federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs and activities in fiscal year 2006. This includes identifying climate change activities, associated costs, and requested funds for promoting clean energy technologies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, carbon capture measures, meeting international responsibilities, and developing climate change response strategies. President George W. Bush announced a goal in 2002 to cut U.S. greenhouse gas intensity. President George W. Bush set a goal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and later aimed to halt increases in GHG emissions by 2025. This would be achieved through regulatory measures, market incentives, and the advancement of clean technologies. Performance targets were set for specific programs, but most climate-related funding requests lacked quantitative targets. President Bush's 2002 strategy aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through regulatory measures and market incentives. The plan included the establishment of a Cabinet-level Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration to oversee research programs. Some stakeholders criticized the policy for proposing emission caps, while others deemed it insufficient. The strategy decentralized program design and management to relevant agencies, leading to concerns about collaboration and accountability. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) was established in 2002 under President Bush's strategy to supplement the U.S. Global Change Research Program (US GCRP). It includes the Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) and the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP), focusing on long-term scientific research and clean energy. The Department of State leads international cooperation efforts, with agencies coordinating through inter-agency working groups. Budget levels are determined through dialogue between agencies and OMB. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) receives funding from various agencies, with NASA contributing $1.20 billion in FY2008, a 12% increase from the previous year. President Bush's FY2009 proposal aimed to increase NASA's CCSP funding by $125.6 million. NASA's share of all CCSP funding remains around 58%, with a focus on space-based observations through satellite acquisitions. President Bush proposed a $125.6 million increase for NASA in FY2009, with $102.3 million allocated for satellite-based observations. This would have raised the satellite share to $769 million (64% of NASA's total budget). Key climate-related data would be ensured through the restoration of the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) and placement of the Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) on the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). These technologies were previously cut from NASA's budget in 2006. Funds were shifted from climate change programs to support the Vision for Space Exploration in FY2005. An NRC report in 2006 criticized the lack of balance in NASA's space and Earth science program. Under the FY2009 proposal, funding for Earth System Science Pathfinder would decrease by 22%. NASA's budget projection included funding for the SMAP mission and a second generation ICESat mission to measure ice topography. NASA has made changes to its accounting methods since 2005, making it difficult to track budget authority across multiple years. Several satellite systems, including Landsat Data Continuity Mission and GRACE, were included in the FY2006 request. NASA is the only agency to present funding for satellite-based climate observations distinctly in its budget submissions. Other agencies, such as NOAA and the Department of Defense, also support satellite-based climate observations. NASA's Earth Science program includes Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and USGS efforts. Applied Sciences and Education bridge NASA's missions with users for societal benefits. FY2009 budget supports climate change adaptation and infectious disease impact assessment. Funding for satellite-based observations has decreased, especially in research and analysis. NRC recommends correcting research program reductions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plays a significant role in the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), with a proposed budget increase of $20 million for climate change science in FY2009. The need for better access to data for NASA users was highlighted, along with concerns about reduced research and analysis efforts for satellite-based observations. Coordination between NASA's applied research and program agencies' needs for climate change missions remains unclear. The FY2009 budget proposal for NOAA includes a $74 million increase for developing key satellite climate sensors, such as the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) sensor and the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) sensor. These sensors aim to distinguish the solar influence from other factors driving climate variability and change. The proposal focuses on observational capacities rather than applied research, assessment, or planning. The Continuing Resolution until March 6, 2009, delays funding redistributions within NOAA. The FY2009 budget proposal for NOAA includes a $74 million increase for developing key satellite climate sensors, reinstating sensors de-manifested in 2006. This increase responds to Decadal Survey recommendations and aims to assure overlapping data series for calibration of measurements. The Administration is counting funding for these items for the first time to provide an accurate picture of climate funding. This addition would raise NOAA's budget authority significantly compared to previous accounting. Proposed reductions include cutting Congressionally directed funding for Regional Climate Centers. The FY2009 budget proposal for NOAA includes a $74 million increase for developing key satellite climate sensors, reinstating sensors de-manifested in 2006. Proposed reductions include cutting Congressionally directed funding for Regional Climate Centers and $19.1 million from the enacted FY2008 level for \"Archive, Access, and Assessment.\" Objectives include developing an integrated earth system analysis capability, creating a high-quality record of the atmosphere and ocean since 1979, and enhancing carbon cycle research on high latitude systems. The FY2009 funding proposal for NOAA includes increases in funding for Climate Data and Information, National Integrated Drought Information System, Water Vapor Process Research, and the creation of a National Climate Service within NOAA. The proposal aims to improve climate forecasting systems and understanding of water vapor distribution in the atmosphere. The proposed Climate Information Services under the National Climate Service aim to enhance seasonal to multi-annual forecasts and drought information. It focuses on improving prediction and responses to drought, hurricanes, fires, floods, and weather extremes. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would see an increase in funding for its contribution to the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) in FY2009. In FY2009, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding for climate change was proposed to increase by $16 million to $220.6 million. This funding would be used for resolving discrepancies in satellite measurements of radiation and providing critical information about aerosols and atmospheric components. The NSF's funding constitutes about 11% of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and was only 3% of total federal funding for climate change in FY2008. The proposed budget included increases for the Geosciences and Office of Polar Programs components of NSF's climate change program. The National Science Foundation (NSF) proposed a $16 million increase in funding for climate change in FY2009, totaling $220.6 million. This funding would address discrepancies in satellite measurements and provide crucial information on aerosols and atmospheric components. The NSF's funding makes up 11% of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and focuses on research infrastructure, educational activities, and data acquisition. Additionally, the Department of Energy (DOE) proposed a $17.6 million increase in funding for the CCSP in FY2009, with a focus on climate forcing research. The Department of Energy (DOE) proposed funding for Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) to study clouds, aerosols, and solar radiation interactions. The funding would support research, infrastructure, and additional mobile facilities. Funding would also go towards research on atmospheric aerosols, Ameriflux for measuring carbon dioxide exchanges, and the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC). In FY2009, the Department of Energy proposed increased funding for climate change modeling, Earth System model development, research on abrupt climate change, and carbon capture and sequestration. The funding included support for experimental studies on the effects of warming, precipitation changes, and CO2 increases on terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, research on carbon capture and sequestration was proposed to increase in the Office of Biological Research. The USGS restructured its climate change science research in 2007, with a budget of $31.4 million for CCSP-related work in FY2009. This included funding for the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive and Biological Research and Monitoring activities. USGS is implementing a new climate change science strategy called the National Climate Effects Research and Monitoring Network, focusing on long-term monitoring and field study sites to assess ecosystem responses to climate change. The USGS proposed expanding use of space-based remote sensing to track environmental changes and developing decision tools for resource managers and policy makers to cope with future climate change. The FY2009 request included eliminating $2.5 million in funding for geologic carbon sequestration assessment and research on hazards, carbon management, and water availability. The Bureau of Reclamation reported climate change-related activities and had a budget greater than many other agencies for impact assessment and adaptation. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $31.9 million for climate change activities, with $19.0 million allocated to the Water for America Initiative. An additional $12.9 million would fund projects for endangered species recovery and investigation programs. Reclamation's efforts focus on planning for the nation's water future and conserving water resources. Collaborative research with other agencies will help manage water resources under changing conditions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services received $46.8 million for climate change science related to health effects of ultra-violet radiation. The Centers for Disease Control is involved in studying climate change impacts on infectious diseases and allergens. Additional research is needed to understand the health effects of global climate change and develop adaptation strategies. The CDC identified 11 priority health actions in response to climate change impacts and developed a policy statement. The World Health Organization released research priorities addressing global health effects of climate change, including interactions with other health determinants, long-term climate change effects, effectiveness of interventions, health impact of non-health sector policies, and strengthening public health systems. The EPA's research on climate change impacts faces funding reductions, risking inadequate future problem-solving and higher costs due to lack of understanding. The EPA's research on climate change impacts faces funding reductions, risking inadequate future problem-solving and higher costs due to lack of understanding. The SAB recommended that EPA adopt long-term GHG reduction objectives to better define their research portfolio. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's funding for climate change science decreased from $64.4 million in FY2008 to $35.7 million in FY2009, with most cuts coming from climate change programs in the Agricultural Research Service. The Agricultural Research Service's carbon cycle activities, including GRACEnet and Agriflux network, aim to understand soil carbon sequestration and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for climate change research in the U.S. Department of Agriculture decreased to $35.7 million in FY2009, with a focus on emissions and impacts on rangelands and agricultural ecosystems. The Forest Service's climate change research funding would be reduced to $18.9 million, while the Economic Research Service's funding remains at $50 thousand. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service's funding would increase to $5.7 million for research on land use and managed ecosystems. CSREES provided grants for research on land use, land cover, and managed ecosystems in terms of carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes. Funding for research on ultraviolet radiation effects on physiology and ecosystems would increase by $0.8 million, and on the carbon cycle by $1.1 million. The FY2009 request proposed $0.5 million for the National Research Initiative. President Bush's FY2009 request for the Climate Change Technology Program is also included in the appendix. The DOE is the largest component of President Bush's CCTP, with proposed changes including reductions in energy efficiency and renewable energy funding, increases in geothermal systems, biofuels, and vehicle technologies, and significant increases in Fossil Energy Research and Development/Efficiency and Sequestration funding. The DOE saw a significant increase in funding for various energy programs, including a tripling of funding for FutureGen, a 71% increase for nuclear energy supply, and a 42% increase for nuclear fusion research. Both the House and Senate passed bills in 2008 covering most of the CCTP appropriations, with deviations from the FY2008 levels and the FY2009 request. The Continuing Resolution added $250 million for weatherization grants. The DOE's budget authority for the CCTP rose from FY2003 to FY2004 due to increased funding for the Clean Coal Power Initiative. The focus of the clean coal program has shifted to improving efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for nuclear energy has increased significantly, making it a large share of CCTP funding. The nuclear energy R&D program aims to develop new technologies to meet energy and climate goals, but critics argue it provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, with the goal of expanding nuclear power while reducing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. However, critics have raised concerns about the proliferation resistance of nuclear recycling technology. Funding for GNEP was sharply criticized in 2008 and eliminated, while funding for advanced nuclear reactors was increased. President Obama has expressed support for safely harnessing nuclear energy to address climate change. Further scrutiny and modifications of nuclear energy initiatives are expected in the future. The CCTP funding levels for FY2008 saw a mix of mandatory and discretionary funding, with a significant increase to about $205 million from $48 million in FY2007. President Bush's proposals for the FY2008 Farm Bill aimed to raise the mandatory share to $151 million. However, President Bush's FY2009 budget projected a $22 million decrease in CCTP funding, primarily from the renewable energy program. Despite this decrease, the overall funding for USDA's CCTP programs had seen a substantial increase from FY2007 to FY2008. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized, modified, and expanded programs for Conservation, Energy, and Rural Development. USDA programs indirectly affect U.S. climate change initiatives, but the impact on overall funding levels for climate change programs is uncertain. Department of Defense funding for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) increased. Department of Defense (DOD) funding for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) rose from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million enacted for FY2008. President Bush's budget proposal aimed to increase funding by an additional $21.4 million in FY2008. DOD appropriations for FY2009 were signed into law on September 30, 2008. The Administration requested to raise Air Force funding for the CCTP by $81.7 million in FY2009, while decreasing funding to the Army and Navy. The DOD would have opportunities to engage in low-greenhouse gas technologies. In 2005, the DOD accounted for 97% of all U.S. Government fuel consumption, costing over $8 billion. The Defense Science Board warned of risks in military operations due to high fuel demand and reliance on a fragile electricity grid. The DOD had not implemented key energy recommendations from a 2001 task force, highlighting the need for leadership oversight. The DoD lacks oversight and accountability for energy usage, with recommendations for senior leadership to establish clear responsibility and measurable goals. Decisions on enhancing energy security could impact greenhouse gas emissions, with controversy over reliance on alternative fuels like oil shale. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 imposed restrictions on agencies procuring alternative fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels, particularly impacting the DoD. The DSB recommended that DoD invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies to address its unique needs, such as producing fuel at forward deployed locations using renewable or waste feedstock to reduce transportation and protection requirements. The DoD should invest in research for alternative, renewable, and low-carbon fuels. DARPA has been praised for its technological advancements and some experts suggest expanding its mission to advance energy technologies. Congress allocated funds for DARPA-E in FY2007, but the Administration proposed to eliminate this funding in FY2009. The 110th Congress amended the DOD authorization to consider the effects of climate change on facilities, capabilities, and missions. The new authorization for military planners includes assessing risks of climate change, updating defense plans, engaging with allies on mitigation strategies, and developing capabilities to reduce impacts. It also requires a review of DOD's capacities to respond to climate change consequences and interagency coordination on national security strategy. EPA's share of funding for climate change programs is proposed to decline. The EPA's budget authority decreased from $105 million in FY2007 to $98 million in FY2009. Funding will continue at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. EPA's role includes inventorying and evaluating greenhouse gas emissions, operating voluntary programs, and providing key scenarios of future emissions. President Bush's proposal would reduce funding for Energy Star programs by $4.0 million. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposal includes cutting $1.3 million by eliminating the Industrial Carbon outreach program and reducing transportation activities by $6.9 million to $11.9 million. The proposal also eliminates funding for a greenhouse gas reporting registry, causing backlash from some Senators. EPA's budget authority decreased from $105 million in FY2007 to $98 million in FY2009, with funding continuing at FY2008 levels. The Greenhouse Gas Registry faced backlash from Senators due to the elimination of funding. Consistent reporting is crucial for emission control programs, with early reporting potentially rewarding leaders in reductions. Various initiatives are being developed for reporting guidelines in anticipation of mandatory requirements. EPA's FY2009 budget includes additional funding for the Asia-Pacific Partnership, previously denied in past appropriations. The EPA and NASA's funding for climate technology initiatives are affected by the FY2008 budget. NASA's CCTP funding is proposed to decrease, with a focus on developing environmentally friendly aircraft. The 2009 defense reauthorization law includes a provision for NASA to support research on environmental issues. President Bush's request would reduce NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program projects to advance environmentally friendly aircraft and technologies such as lithium-ion batteries and regenerative fuel cells. Funding for measuring surface radiation for solar heating would remain constant at $1.6 million. The Bush Administration identified general technologies as \"high priority\" within the Climate Change Technology Priorities, but it is unclear how funding decisions are made for these technologies."
