    "title": "SB 1051",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District are allowed to install automated parking control devices on public transit vehicles for video imaging of parking violations in transit-only lanes. Citations can only be issued during posted hours of operation, with devices focused on capturing violations without unnecessary images of others. Prior to issuing parking violation notices, San Francisco and Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District will have a 30-day warning notice program. Designated employees will review video recordings to identify parking violations in transit-only lanes, subject to civil penalties. The registered owner can review video evidence of alleged violations for free during business hours. The evidence can be kept for up to six months or 60 days after final disposition, then must be destroyed. Video evidence from automated devices without transit lane violations must be destroyed within 15 days. The records are confidential and can only be used for authorized purposes by public agencies. The Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District has authority to enforce parking violations in transit-only lanes until January 1, 2022. Definitions for \"local agency\" and \"transit-only traffic lane\" are provided. If the district implements an automated enforcement system, a report on its effectiveness, privacy impact, cost, and revenue generation must be submitted to the Legislature by January 1, 2021. A report on the effectiveness, privacy impact, cost, and revenue generation of an automated enforcement system for parking violations in transit-only lanes must be submitted to the Legislature by January 1, 2021 in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code. Section 40241 of the Vehicle Code is amended. A designated employee must issue a notice of parking violation to the vehicle owner within 15 days of the violation. The notice must include details of the violation, payment deadline, and procedures for contesting the citation. It should also include the date, time, location of the violation, vehicle details, and instructions for payment or contesting the citation. The notice of parking violation, issued within 15 days of the violation, is considered a record of the City and County of San Francisco or the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District. It serves as evidence of the violation and includes information on how to request a review of the video evidence. The notice of parking violation is served by mail to the registered owner's address. Payment or contesting must be done within 21 days. The local agency can cancel the violation in the interest of justice. Contestants can seek court review after an administrative hearing. The City and County of San Francisco or the contracted law enforcement agency for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District may use a private vendor for processing parking violation notices. They will maintain control of the program. The Legislature deems a special law necessary due to unique circumstances in enforcing parking violations in the district. This act amends the Vehicle Code and limits public access to meetings and writings of public officials for the protected interest. To protect privacy rights, access to images from parking control devices on public transit vehicles owned by Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District will be limited."
