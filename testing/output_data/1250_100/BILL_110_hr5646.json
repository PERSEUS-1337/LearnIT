It addresses the restrictions on possessing firearms in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System, which hinder individuals from exercising their second amendment rights.

No Federal regulation shall restrict any individual from possessing or carrying a firearm or ammunition in these units based on their location. Federal law should clarify that second amendment rights in National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System units will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict individuals from possessing or carrying firearms or ammunition in these units based on their location. The purpose of this section is to require hunting activities as a land use in all Federal land management plans unless clearly incompatible. The head of the agency must ensure hunting is allowed unless incompatible, and reasons for not allowing hunting must be published in the management plan. Charging fees related to hunting activities on Federal land does not constitute unrestricted hunting. Fees charged for hunting activities on Federal land must only recoup management costs and not exceed what is necessary. The definition of hunting includes trapping, netting, and fishing. Management plans for Federal land must include provisions for hunting activities. This section applies to all management plans for Federal land developed, approved, or amended after the enactment date."
