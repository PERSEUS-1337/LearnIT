    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2010\". The Congress declares the increasing accessibility of the Arctic Ocean to shipping due to thinning ice cover and technological advancements. It is in the interests of the United States to ensure safe, environmentally protective, and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. The United States aims to protect its interests in the Arctic by ensuring safe passage for vessels, supporting international cooperation for reliable shipping, and implementing coordinated regulations to address risks posed by increased shipping activity. The United States has interests in the Arctic outside its territorial waters, with proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways. The country relies on icebreaker platforms for research, security, and commercial interests, and may see growth in sovereign interests with a claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers and establishing coordinated shipping regulations are essential for addressing risks in the region. Coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention in the Arctic are crucial for protecting United States interests. International cooperation is necessary, starting with the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council. This is important due to the current extensive use of the Arctic Ocean by vessels from various nations. The Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation is crucial for protecting United States interests in the Arctic Ocean. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and search and rescue. The Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard is encouraged to negotiate agreements through the International Maritime Organization with Arctic nations to coordinate actions for marine safety, oil spill prevention, vessel tracking, and search and rescue. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System is responsible for coordination. The Secretary of Transportation, established under a directive of the President in the Ocean Action Plan, shall coordinate domestic transportation policies in the Arctic. The Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard may enter agreements and contracts to carry out the purpose of this section. Icebreaking for safe maritime navigation and demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic are also promoted. Authorization of appropriations for Arctic operations, including training mariners for ice navigation and prevention of discharges. Funding allocated for seasonal operations, agreements, and demonstration projects. Analysis of Arctic polar ice-breaking mission requirements to be conducted within 90 days of enactment of the Act. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers or constructing new ones for Federal icebreaking missions. Additionally, an analysis of the impact on mission capacity and presence in the Arctic regions through 2020 must be conducted if the icebreaker fleet is recapitalized. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit reports to Congress within specific timeframes, including results of studies and recommendations for Arctic icebreaking mission requirements. The Commandant of the Coast Guard submits reports to Congress with recommendations as required by law. The Commandant of the Coast Guard submits reports to Congress with recommendations as required by law regarding the assessment of needs for additional Coast Guard presence in high latitude regions. The Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to Congress within 270 days, assessing the need for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions. This includes evaluating current assets, projected needs for forward operating bases, and requirements for infrastructure and resources to support operations in these regions. The report to Congress will assess the need for high latitude icebreaking capability and the current condition of Coast Guard assets in those regions. It will also estimate acquisition and maintenance costs for additional prevention and response capability in high latitude areas for all Coast Guard mission areas. The report to Congress will include detailed cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability over a 10-year period, including renovating and modernizing the existing fleet and replacing it. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act is defined the same way as in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
