    "content": "The \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" prohibits the import of spent nuclear fuel into the United States unless approved by Congress, licensed by the appropriate Federal agency, and the repository is operational. National security exceptions are also outlined. SEC. 3 of the \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" outlines national security exceptions for importing spent nuclear fuel, including exemptions for countries suspected of nuclear weapons development. SEC. 4 addresses guidelines for safe shipment of certain materials by port authorities. Port authorities have the authority to establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at marine ports, ensuring public health and safety. Guidelines may include worker training, response plans for emergencies, and community notification. The guidelines established by port authorities for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel include standards for storage, transportation, and prohibitions to minimize radiation exposure and accident risks. Worker radiation exposure levels must not exceed public exposure standards. These guidelines aim to protect public health and safety. The guidelines for safe handling of spent nuclear fuel must prioritize public health, safety, and the environment over other laws. The existence of laws on fuel transfer does not prevent the adoption of stricter guidelines. The Act prioritizes public health, safety, and the environment in handling nuclear materials. It clarifies that the port's liability and indemnification are not affected. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"atomic energy defense activity,\" \"port authority,\" and \"repository.\" The Act of 1982 defines key terms like \"spent nuclear fuel\" according to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982."
