    "content": "The \"Grid Reliability Act of 2014\" is also known as the Grid Reliability Act. It focuses on grid reliability. The Grid Reliability Act of 2014, also known as the Grid Reliability Act, amends Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to address temporary connection and exchange of facilities during emergencies. It ensures that orders issued under this subsection do not conflict with environmental laws and serve the public interest. The Grid Reliability Act of 2014 amends Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to allow temporary connection and exchange of facilities during emergencies. Orders issued under this subsection must comply with environmental laws and minimize adverse impacts. Noncompliance with environmental laws due to following these orders is not subject to liability. The Grid Reliability Act of 2014 allows temporary connection and exchange of facilities during emergencies under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. Orders issued must comply with environmental laws and can be renewed for subsequent 90-day periods as necessary. The Commission consults with relevant federal agencies to minimize adverse impacts when renewing or reissuing orders. The Commission may exclude conditions from renewed or reissued orders if they hinder addressing emergencies adequately. An explanation must be provided publicly if a condition is excluded. If an order is stayed, modified, or set aside by a court, it falls under section 313. The court can modify or set aside an order under section 313 or other laws, but any actions taken to comply with the order remain subject to paragraph (4). Section 202(d) of the Federal Power Act is amended to include municipalities in temporary connections or constructions."
