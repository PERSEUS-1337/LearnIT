Recent studies show that male workers in the top earnings quintile can live up to 12 years longer than those in the bottom quintile. This disparity has sparked interest and concern, leading to further research and policy discussions. Recent studies by various institutions have highlighted the widening gap in life expectancy between the rich and the poor. This disparity has implications for federal programs like Social Security, which aims to redistribute income from high to low earners. Policymakers are concerned about the impact of increasing longevity differentials on such programs. The widening gap in life expectancy between high and low earners has implications for Social Security benefits. Increasing the retirement age could disproportionately affect low earners. Policymakers may need to reconsider reform proposals to protect the interests of lower-earning workers. This report discusses the link between life expectancy, socioeconomic status, and Social Security benefits in the United States. Life expectancy is a measure of population longevity that has an inverse relationship with mortality rates. It can vary across demographic subgroups such as age, sex, or race. Life expectancy is commonly presented as life expectancy at birth or at age 65, but can be calculated at any age. Differential mortality rates across groups result in differential life expectancy estimates. This research discusses the implications of the widening gap in life expectancy between high and low earners on Social Security benefits, particularly in relation to proposals to raise the retirement age. Life expectancy data from the CDC shows differences by sex and race, with life expectancy at birth in 2014 being 76.4 years for men and 81.2 years for women. For blacks, life expectancy was 75.6 years and for whites, it was 79.0 years. At age 65, life expectancy was 18.0 years for men and 20.5 years for women. Blacks had a life expectancy of 18.2 years and whites had 19.3 years at age 65 in 2014. Life expectancy data from the CDC shows differences by sex and race, with life expectancy at birth in 2014 being 76.4 years for men and 81.2 years for women. At age 65, life expectancy was 18.0 years for men and 20.5 years for women, with blacks having a life expectancy of 18.2 years and whites 19.3 years. Life expectancy has increased over time for all groups due to decreases in mortality rates. During the second half of the 20th century, improvements in chronic disease prevention and medical technology have contributed to reduced adult mortality rates. Gaps in life expectancy across sex and race persist, with women generally living longer than men and whites outliving blacks. Researchers attribute these differences to biological, behavioral, and social factors. Researchers have found higher mortality rates for blacks due to health disparities and interactions among factors such as socioeconomic status, behavioral factors, access to healthcare, and environmental surroundings. Disparities in life expectancy by socioeconomic status have been documented, with SES serving as a measure of class and inequality. The gap in life expectancy by SES has been growing over time, particularly in recent decades. SES is commonly measured by income, education, occupation, or a combination of these factors in life expectancy research. In life expectancy research, SES can be operationalized using education or income. The positive relationship between education and life expectancy is well-documented, with a growing gap over time. However, using education as a measure of SES has drawbacks such as reporting errors and being a broad measure that may overlook disparities between subgroups. Shifts in educational attainment in the US over the last century also impact conclusions drawn about time. Recent evidence on life expectancy gaps by income is presented in this report. Income is chosen as a measure of SES due to its detailed measurement and relative comparison capabilities. Using average lifetime income helps capture adult SES, despite potential reverse causality issues. Lifetime earnings, correlated with total income, are particularly selected for analysis. The section discusses recent studies on the relationship between life expectancy and income as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES). Hilary Waldron's 2007 research contributes significantly to understanding trends in life expectancy by earnings, using Social Security data on taxable wages matched with benefits and death records for males aged 60 or older. Hilary Waldron's research analyzes cohort life expectancy at age 65 for male Social Security-covered workers based on earnings distribution from 1912-1941 birth cohorts. The study uses individual's peak lifetime earnings as a proxy for socioeconomic status and highlights differences in life expectancy between the bottom and top halves of the earnings distribution. The research does not address changes in the income distribution itself, suggesting potential disparities between lower and higher earners. The box-and-whisker plot shows the widening life expectancy gap between the top and bottom halves of the earnings distribution from 1912 to 1941 birth cohorts. Men in the top half can expect to live significantly longer than those in the bottom half, with little improvement for the bottom half over time. Waldron's research emphasizes the small gains in life expectancy for the bottom half of the income distribution compared to the top half. The study highlights a widening life expectancy gap between the top and bottom halves of the earnings distribution. Life expectancy increases continuously with lifetime earnings, but the bottom half experiences small gains. Limitations include the sample's health requirements and the inability to draw nuanced conclusions from gross income comparisons. Waldron's assumptions in life expectancy projections may not fully represent the population. Julian Cristia's 2009 study analyzes lifetime earnings trends from 1983-2003, showing a significant increase in life expectancy differentials across income groups. Using data from various sources, Cristia found a substantial rise in the life expectancy gap between the top and bottom earners, with men experiencing a 30% increase and women doubling their gap during this period. The study by Julian Cristia in 2009 revealed a significant increase in life expectancy gaps between income groups from 1983-2003. Men saw a 30% increase in the gap, while women's gap doubled. Cristia raised concerns about the exclusion of unhealthy individuals from the labor force, which could bias the relationship between lifetime earnings and life expectancy. The Congressional Budget Office also studied the life expectancy income gap using a detailed model. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses the CBOLT microsimulation model to estimate period life expectancy at age 65, predicting an increase in life expectancy, especially for individuals with higher lifetime earnings. In 2014, a 65-year-old man in the upper earnings quintile is expected to live over three years longer than someone in the lowest quintile, with a similar trend for women. By 2039, CBO projects a six-year difference for men and a one-year difference for women based on lifetime earnings. In 2039, CBO projects a growing life expectancy gap based on income, with higher-earning individuals living longer. A 2015 NAS study also confirms this trend, using data from 1992-2008 to compare life expectancy between different income groups. The study defines lifetime earnings as Social Security-reported household earnings for individuals aged 41-50 and estimates cohort life expectancy at age 50 for those born in 1930 and 1960. Projections are used to calculate life expectancy beyond 2008, showing a significant difference in life expectancy based on income levels. The study analyzed life expectancy based on income for men in the 1930 and 1960 birth cohorts. Men in the bottom income quintile born in 1930 had an average life expectancy of 26.6 additional years at age 50, compared to 26.1 years for those born in the 1960 cohort. In contrast, men in the top income quintile experienced an increase in life expectancy from 31.7 to 38.8 additional years between the two cohorts. This resulted in a widening gap in life expectancy at age 50 between the lowest and highest income quintiles, from 5.1 years for the 1930 cohort to 12.7 years for the 1960 cohort. The life expectancy gap between the bottom and top income quintiles increased from 5.1 years for the 1930 cohort to 12.7 years for the 1960 cohort. This trend was driven by longevity gains among men in the top income quintile, with a small decline in longevity among men in the bottom quintile also contributing. For women, a similar pattern was observed, with the life expectancy gap between the bottom and top income quintiles expanding from 3.9 years in the 1930 cohort to 13.6 years in the 1960 cohort. The study analyzes demographic data from surveys matched to Social Security data on earnings, benefits, and dates of death to determine life expectancy by income decile. Men in the lowest income decile born in 1920 could expect to live to about 74.3 years, compared to 79.3 years for men in the top income decile. The life expectancy gap by income increases over time, with men born in 1940 in the lowest income decile living to about 76 years compared to 88 years for those in the top income decile. Among men, the life expectancy gap between the lowest and highest income deciles grew from 5 years for those born in 1920 to 12 years for those born in 1940. Women in the lowest income decile showed no increase in life expectancy, while those in the highest income decile gained 6.4 years for the 1940 birth cohort. Results confirm that life expectancy gains are skewed towards higher income individuals. During the 1999-2014 period, higher income is linked to increased life expectancy, with a gap of 14.6 years for men and 10.1 years for women between the bottom 1% and top 1%. The life expectancy gap widened over time, with smaller gains at higher income levels. Limitations include assumptions about future mortality patterns. The Social Security program provides monthly benefits to retired workers, disabled workers, and survivors of workers. Benefits are inflation-adjusted for life, with approximately 94% of workers covered. After meeting eligibility requirements, beneficiaries may claim benefits. In February 2017, 61 million beneficiaries received $76 billion in total benefit payments, with an average monthly benefit of $1,250. Life expectancy and income are key factors in benefit calculations. The impact of life expectancy gaps by income on Social Security retirement benefits is discussed in this section. Full monthly benefits are payable at the full retirement age (FRA), which is age 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954. Benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, with reductions for early claiming and increases for delaying retirement. For example, claiming at age 62 results in a 30% reduction, while claiming at age 70 increases benefits by 24%. The Social Security program aims for social adequacy by providing basic income support to all covered workers and their dependents. It also strives for individual equity by tying benefits to a worker's earnings history and being available without evidence of need. Higher replacement rates of lifetime earnings are awarded to low-earning workers compared to high-earning workers to promote progressivity. The Social Security benefit formula provides higher benefits to higher earners, aiming to maintain a balance between social adequacy and individual equity. The formula calculates the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) based on past earnings indexed to wages. It is progressive, with lower earners receiving a higher percentage of their career-average earnings in monthly benefits. The formula includes \"bend points\" representing different earnings levels. The Social Security benefit formula adjusts bend points annually to the average wage index. As AIME increases, the replacement rate decreases, with benefits replacing 32% of earnings between $885 and $5,336, and only 15% for earnings above $5,336. Redistribution occurs due to declining rate of return on lifetime contributions. There is a cap on earnings subject to Social Security tax, limiting benefits. The replacement rate is a measure of program adequacy, calculated for different worker profiles by SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary. For workers born in 1950 retiring at FRA, the maximum benefit is $2,687. The Social Security program's progressivity is measured by comparing lifetime benefits to lifetime payroll taxes. If lower earners have a higher ratio of benefits to taxes, NPV, or IRR, the program is considered progressive. Life expectancy variations can impact progressivity due to the number of years benefits are received. The value of lifetime Social Security benefits can vary based on individual life expectancies, impacting the net benefits received. Social Security does not currently adjust its initial benefit formula for differences in life expectancy, potentially undermining the program's progressivity. If life expectancy differs by income, lifetime benefits and contributions will also vary, further affecting the redistributive nature of the program. The growing income gap will undermine the redistributive nature of Social Security benefits. Research shows that higher life expectancy for higher-income individuals reduces progressivity but does not reverse the overall progressive nature of Social Security benefits. Adjustments for mortality narrow the difference in rate of return on lifetime contributions between low and high-income groups. Researchers have used newer evidence on widening mortality differentials to provide estimates. Researchers have estimated how income differentials affect Social Security benefits, with higher earners expected to collect higher monthly benefits over a longer period. Studies make assumptions about earnings, benefits, and life expectancy, with a general consensus that higher earners gain more. The NAS study provides estimates of lifetime benefits based on midcareer earnings, showing a widening gap in benefits between income quintiles. Earnings above the taxable maximum are estimated based on the month in which the cap is reached. Lifetime income is adjusted for married couples by dividing the sum of their earnings by an equivalence scale. Social Security benefits are simulated for the 1930 and 1960 birth cohorts, with benefits increasing with earnings. Present values of benefits at age 50 are estimated, adjusted for life expectancy for males and females, showing a correlation between earnings and benefits. The Social Security benefit computation formula allows for lower earners to earn a higher replacement rate than higher earners, but their dollar value of benefits received is lower due to benefits increasing with earnings. Males born in 1930 in the lowest earnings quintile receive $126,000 in lifetime benefits, compared to $229,000 for males in the highest earnings quintile. The lowest earnings groups have seen little improvement in life expectancy, resulting in flat benefits for males born in 1960 in the bottom earnings quintile. Gains in life expectancy increase the difference between the top and bottom earnings quintiles from $103,000 for the 1930 cohort to $173,000 for the 1960 cohort. The Social Security benefit differentials by earnings have increased between the 1930 and 1960 cohorts for both men and women. The gains in benefits are most significant at the highest earnings quintile, with females in the top quintile seeing their benefits increase from $208,000 to $235,000. This increase is driven by gains in life expectancy skewed towards those with higher earnings, observed across all but the bottom two-fifths of the earnings distribution. The 2016 Brookings report analyzed the impact of differences in life expectancy for the 1920 and 1940 birth cohorts on Social Security retirement benefits. Males in the top earnings decile in 1940 gained about 8.7 years in life expectancy compared to the 1920 cohort, while those in the lowest earnings decile gained only about 1.7 years. The study showed a strong positive relationship between life expectancy gains and increases in expected lifetime Social Security retirement benefits. Expected Social Security lifetime benefits increased by 10% for the bottom earnings decile, 24% for the sixth earnings decile, and 40% for higher earners born in 1940 compared to those born in 1920. The study analyzed the impact of differences in life expectancy on Social Security retirement benefits for different earnings deciles. Females in the top earnings decile in 1940 gained about six years compared to the 1920 cohort, with no increase in life expectancy for women in the lowest earnings decile. Benefits for females increased by 12% for the sixth earnings decile and 26% for the topmost earnings decile. The highest earnings decile of the 1940 male cohort receives 3.3 times the benefits of the lowest earnings decile, compared to 2.6 times for the 1920 cohort. For females, the disparity in benefits is 1.9 times for the 1940 cohort, compared to 1.5 times for the 1920 cohort. The 2016 GAO study found widening differentials in Social Security retirement benefits by earnings. Using the SSA \"Quick Calculator,\" they estimated lifetime retirement benefits for hypothetical individuals based on income percentiles from the 2015 CPS. Lower-income males see a projected reduction of 11% to 14% in benefits, while higher-income males see an increase of 16% to 18% compared to those with average life expectancy. Differential life expectancy results in smaller (bigger) estimated lifetime benefits for lower- (higher-) income groups. In a 2011 study, Gopi Shah Goda, John Shoven, and Sita Slavov analyze the progressivity of Social Security for retired worker benefits considering differential mortality patterns. They use metrics like net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) to assess outcomes. Women generally have higher IRRs and NPVs than men due to longer life expectancies and lower earnings. Later cohorts have higher IRRs and NPVs than earlier cohorts. Differential mortality has a larger effect on outcomes for later cohorts. The study shows that while Social Security remains progressive for women, it becomes regressive for later birth cohorts of men due to increasing mortality inequality. Uneven gains in life expectancy impact lifetime retirement benefits, widening the gap between low and high earners. High earners will continue to see an increase in lifetime benefits and returns to contributions made to the Social Security program. Increased longevity is a sign of progress in the population, but it poses a policy challenge on how to fund additional years in retirement. The shift in age distribution from 2010 to 2030, due to lower birth rates and increased life expectancy, is a key factor driving up costs for public programs like Social Security. Disability and survivor benefits remain strongly progressive, but progressivity in retirement benefits may erode as high earners continue to see higher lifetime benefits and returns to contributions. Increased longevity and increased life expectancy are driving up costs for public programs like Social Security. Various options exist to address Social Security's financing challenges, including slowing benefit expenditure growth, changing benefit formulas, indexing initial benefits for price changes, changing the retirement age, and increasing program revenue through changes in the taxation of earnings. One proposed option is to increase the Full Retirement Age beyond 67 to account for the population's ability to work to older ages in the future. Increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) can result in fewer months of benefits and a reduction in total lifetime Social Security benefits received. The 1983 Social Security amendments raised the FRA but not the earliest eligibility age, leading to a penalty for claiming benefits early. Various proposals suggest gradually raising the FRA and maximum benefit age, with the Bipartisan Policy Center Commission recommending increasing the FRA to 69 and the maximum benefit age to 72. Additionally, bills in the 112th Congress proposed raising the FRA to 69 and the earliest eligibility age to 64. The Fiscal Sustainability Act of 2013 and the Social Security Reform Act of 2016 proposed increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) to 69. The Simpson-Bowles Commission also recommended raising the FRA and the Early Eligibility Age (EEA), with projections showing the EEA reaching 64 and the FRA reaching 69 by 2070. Research discusses the impact of increasing retirement ages and the limitations of hardship exemptions for low earners. The 2015 NAS study simulated the effects of raising both the EEA and FRA. The study simulates the policy impact of increasing Social Security's Early Eligibility Age (EEA) and Full Retirement Age (FRA), considering both mechanical and behavioral effects on benefits. The first policy simulation increases the EEA from age 62 to 64, resulting in a reduction in monthly benefits for those claiming early. Claiming at the EEA of 62 currently leads to a 30% benefit reduction compared to claiming at the FRA of 67. Raising the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) from 62 to 64 would lead to individuals who would have claimed at ages 62 or 63 now claiming at age 64, receiving higher monthly benefits for fewer years. This policy change would not affect those who claim at the Full Retirement Age (FRA) or higher. For low-income earners, the average lifetime Social Security benefit would rise by a modest amount after the policy change, making it close to being actuarially fair. High earners also claim at the EEA, but the change in expected lifetime benefits is smaller for them. Increasing the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) from 62 to 64 would result in higher monthly benefits for high earners due to their higher life expectancy. This policy change would skew the distribution of Social Security benefits in favor of high earners, as shown in a simulation using 2008 SSA data. Waldron's 2013 study examines the effects of this policy change on individuals born between 1937 and 1945. Waldron's study from 2013 analyzes the impact of increasing the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) on individuals born between 1937 and 1945. She challenges the idea of using income thresholds to determine eligibility for exemptions, finding a strong link between income and mortality even above these thresholds. Waldron's research shows that higher earnings are associated with lower mortality risk, except for the top 20% of earners where this link weakens. For an income threshold to effectively protect individuals from adverse effects of EEA increases, mortality risk must remain relatively constant. A graduated income threshold that phases in changes in the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) may be a potential remedy to protect individuals from adverse effects of policy changes. Another popular policy proposal is an increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) to ensure not all additional years of life are spent in retirement. A study found that increasing the FRA to age 70 would reduce benefits for all retirees, with the lowest income quintile experiencing a 25% reduction and the highest income quintile a 22% reduction. The study by Chetty et al. in 2016 analyzed IRS income data to show that life expectancy increases with income, with no clear dividing line. Higher earners can delay retirement benefits longer, resulting in a smaller drop in lifetime benefits. Increasing the Full Retirement Age would widen the gap in lifetime benefits between income quintiles. Policy proposals to increase the retirement age may benefit higher earners more, as they can delay benefits longer, resulting in smaller drops in lifetime benefits. However, research shows that the positive association between income and life expectancy weakens only around the top fifth of the income distribution. Implementing a simple hardship threshold based on low earnings may not adequately protect all individuals affected by uneven gains in life expectancy, especially women who tend to live longer but have lower lifetime earnings compared to men. One potential solution to address the uneven gains in life expectancy is to focus on a graduated income threshold that phases out at higher earnings levels. The Bipartisan Policy Center's 2016 report on retirement security offers various Social Security reform proposals, including increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA). Recent research highlights a growing gap in life expectancy by income, with individuals with lower lifetime earnings experiencing shorter lives compared to those with higher earnings. This gap has widened over recent decades. The evidence indicates a growing gap in life expectancy by income, with higher earners experiencing longer lives and collecting Social Security benefits for longer periods. Public policy proposals to increase the retirement age may impact the progressivity of benefits, as life expectancy continues to rise with income. A hardship income threshold may need to be carefully constructed to protect low earners as life expectancy increases with income, suggesting no simple income cutoff point. Other policies may be necessary to mitigate the impact of a higher retirement age on low lifetime earners."
