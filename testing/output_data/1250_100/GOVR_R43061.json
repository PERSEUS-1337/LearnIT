    "content": "Many congressional policymakers are concerned about the adequacy of the U.S. science and engineering workforce to meet various national needs. Congress funds programs to improve STEM skills, encourage students to pursue science and engineering degrees, and provide research experiences at universities. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and potential changes to immigration policies related to visas and green cards for the S&E workforce. The report provides data on employment, wages, and unemployment for the science and engineering (S&E) workforce, including computer occupations, mathematical occupations, engineers, life scientists, physical scientists, and S&E management occupations. It covers current statistics for 2016, recent trends from 2012-2016, and projections for 2016-2026 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for changes in the S&E workforce from 2016-2026 are analyzed, along with stakeholder perspectives on ensuring an adequate workforce for the 21st century. Definitions of the S&E workforce vary, with different occupations included in different analyses. The size of the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce varies depending on included occupations, with estimates ranging from 6 million to over 21 million. The debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce focuses on computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. The S&E workforce includes life scientists and management occupations but excludes social scientists and S&E-related technicians. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million, categorized into six occupational groups including computer occupations, mathematical occupations, and engineers. The S&E workforce in 2016 consisted of various occupational groups, including engineers, life scientists, physical scientists, and science and engineering managers. The report provides detailed descriptions of each occupation and educational composition, based on federal government data. The report relies on federal government data sources such as the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey for employment and wage data from 2012-2016. The survey covers over 800 occupations and defines \"employees\" as part-time and full-time workers paid a wage or salary. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage.\" Unemployment data is sourced from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The BLS's Employment Projections provide occupational and industry employment data for 10-year periods, including wage and salary employment patterns. The projections cover the 2016-2026 period and include data from the OES survey and CES data. The report also discusses recent trends in employment, wages, and unemployment from 2012 to 2016. The biennial employment projections for the 2016-2026 time frame consider various factors affecting the U.S. S&E workforce, such as economic conditions, technology development, funding for research, and changes in labor force skills. The report does not attribute changes in the workforce to specific factors. Comparing OES data over time may pose challenges due to survey methodology limitations. The OES data poses challenges for time series comparisons due to changes in classification systems, data collection methods, and mean wage estimation. The CRS used data from 2012-2016 to enhance comparability and provide current trends in S&E occupations. The OES survey maintained consistent occupational categories throughout this period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics considers various factors in developing employment projections, including population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, and technological innovation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics considers various factors such as economic growth, technological innovation, changes in business practices, and expected employment changes in different industry segments for its occupational projections. BLS replaced its methodology for estimating occupational replacement needs with a new methodology for estimating occupational separations due to identified issues. Other factors affecting occupational projections include immigration laws, trade laws, technological advances, consumer tastes, wars, and disasters. In 2016, 6.9 million people were employed in the United States as scientists and engineers, accounting for 4.9% of total U.S. employment. Computer occupations and engineers made up 81% of S&E jobs. Scientists and engineers have a mean annual wage higher than the national average. In 2016, scientists and engineers in the United States had a mean annual wage of $94,450, higher than the national average. S&E managers had the highest mean annual wage at $144,270, followed by engineers, mathematical occupations, computer occupations, physical scientists, and life scientists. Unemployment rates for S&E occupations ranged from 0.2% to 5.2%, with most below the overall rate of 4.9%. During 2012-2016, S&E employment grew by 747,040 jobs, reaching 6.9 million, with a 2.9% annual growth rate. Computer, engineering, and mathematical occupations saw the most growth. Table 3 provides employment data for each S&E occupational group. During 2012-2016, S&E employment grew by 747,040 jobs, reaching 6.9 million, with a 2.9% annual growth rate.

Among life scientists, medical scientists had the largest employment growth. Computer and information systems managers, as well as natural sciences managers, experienced growth in S&E management occupations. In contrast, architectural and engineering managers declined. The 10 S&E occupations with the largest employment growth included computer, engineering, mathematics, and S&E management occupations. The occupation with the greatest employment loss was computer programmers, possibly due to reclassification. Mathematical science occupations had the fastest growth rate, followed by operations research analysts and computer occupations. Between 2012 and 2016, S&E employment grew by 747,040 jobs, reaching 6.9 million with a 2.9% annual growth rate. Mathematical occupations had the fastest growth at 8.5% CAGR, with operations research analysts leading at 12.1% CAGR. S&E managers had the fastest wage growth at 2.5% CAGR, followed by computer occupations at 2.4% CAGR. All other S&E occupational groups had smaller wage growth rates than all occupations. Between 2012 and 2016, S&E employment grew by 747,040 jobs, reaching 6.9 million with a 2.9% annual growth rate. Mathematical occupations had the fastest growth at 8.5% CAGR. Life scientists, engineers, physical scientists, and mathematic occupations experienced wage growth rates below 1.4% CAGR. Mathematical occupations saw a small decline in mean wages. S&E occupational groups had lower unemployment rates compared to the overall workforce, but were comparable or higher than other selected professional occupations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. This growth rate is higher than the projected rate for all occupations. Additionally, 1.439 million scientists and engineers are expected to exit the workforce during this period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. Additionally, there will be 3.7 million openings created by occupational transfers in S&E positions during this period. The projections methodology allows for multiple occupational transfers from the same position during the 10-year projection period. Table 10 provides information on employment projections for science and engineering occupational groups. Computer occupations are expected to see the largest increase in employed individuals, accounting for 64.0% of the total growth in S&E occupations by 2026. Mathematical occupations are projected to have the fastest employment growth at a rate of 2.5% CAGR. Computer occupations are projected to have the fastest employment growth at a rate of 2.5% CAGR, increasing their share of total S&E employment slightly from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2026. Other occupational groups like S&E Managers, Engineers, Life Scientists, and Physical Scientists are expected to account for a smaller share of total S&E job growth compared to their share of total 2016 S&E employment. The projected share of 2026 S&E employment is expected to be 3.7%. The number of new jobs created is significantly lower than the number needed to replace those exiting the labor force. For S&E occupations, the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce is less than twice the number of new jobs created. Labor force exits exceed the number of projected new jobs in nearly all S&E occupational groups. Job growth in engineering occupations is projected to be lower than labor force exits, while mathematical occupations are expected to have more job openings resulting from growth than exits. Figure 6 and Figure 7 illustrate the composition of projected job openings by job growth, labor force exits, and occupational transfers for each S&E occupational group for the 2016-2026 period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects job growth and labor force exits for S&E occupations from 2016-2026. The top 10 S&E occupations with the highest job growth include computer occupations, civil engineers, and mechanical engineers. Computer programmers are the only occupation projected to see a reduction in jobs. Table 13 displays the 10 fastest-growing S&E occupations, including statisticians, software developers (applications), and mathematicians. These occupations have growth rates ranging from 2.6% to 2.9% CAGR, outpacing the overall job growth rate for all occupations. Table 14 lists the 10 S&E occupations with the slowest job growth rates, with rates below the overall average. This includes engineering occupations and architectural and engineering managers. Table 15 highlights the 10 S&E occupations with the most projected job openings. Table 15 displays the top 10 S&E occupations with the highest projected job openings, including computer occupations, engineering occupations, and mathematical occupations, accounting for 60.8% of all job openings. In contrast, Table 16 shows the 10 S&E occupations with the lowest projected job openings, representing less than 1% of all job openings. Scientists and engineers are crucial for U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and societal needs, with Congress expressing concerns about the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce for over 60 years. The Congress has been concerned about the science and engineering workforce for over 60 years, enacting programs to support education and development in STEM fields. There are diverse views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce, including debates on shortages and policy interventions. The federal government may need to intervene to address a potential shortage in the science and engineering workforce. Some argue that there is a shortage, which could impact U.S. leadership in various sectors. Others believe there is no shortage based on employment and wage data. Regardless, increasing the number of scientists and engineers could benefit innovation, economic performance, and job creation. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is seen as beneficial for innovation, economic performance, and job creation. However, government interventions to address perceived shortages may lead to inefficiencies in the labor market. Workforce projections for S&E occupations are unreliable, which could result in an oversupply or undersupply of students with S&E degrees. Projections for S&E workforce may lead to mismatches between education and market needs due to various factors like technological changes, retirement behavior, and government policies. Shortages may occur in certain industries or occupations, but the labor market will resolve these needs through wage adjustments and increased supply. The potential adverse consequences of even discrete shortages in the S&E workforce require government interventions to prevent the loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and diminished national security. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to lower labor costs and increase current knowledge through increased supply of young, lower-cost graduates. The real issue lies in a skills mismatch, not a shortage of people, leading to difficulties in meeting specific workforce needs. Expanding immigration to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States can help address the skills mismatch between employers and S&E workers. However, it may also depress wages, increase unemployment, and discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. as students lag behind their foreign counterparts. This disparity may lead to fewer talented scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Standardized tests do not accurately reflect U.S. students' STEM knowledge or their preparedness for S&E degrees and careers. There are differing opinions on the role of the federal government in fostering the S&E workforce, including increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees and admitting foreign scientists and engineers to the U.S. The text discusses various strategies to bolster U.S. competitiveness in science and engineering, including admitting foreign scientists and engineers, increasing diversity in STEM fields, improving K-12 STEM education, and enhancing career counseling for high school students. Data on the educational composition of S&E occupations is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using the American Community Survey. The report illustrates S&E occupations using charts, aggregating educational levels below associate's degrees into a category called \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category includes \"less than high school diploma,\" \"high school diploma or equivalent,\" and \"some college, no degree.\""
