    "content": "Intelligence officials and Congress are discussing reducing intelligence spending while maintaining core capabilities. DNI James R. Clapper Jr. warned that sequestration could lead to a 7% cut, or $4 billion, in the National Intelligence Program budget, impacting global coverage and intelligence collection. He highlighted the negative effects of past budget cuts in the 1990s, which distorted the intelligence workforce. Congress passed the FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation in December 2012, signed into law in January 2013. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 created a Director of National Intelligence to oversee the intelligence community and advise the President. This was in response to the increased intelligence threats following the 9/11 attacks. The final bill for FY2013 was signed into law in January 2013, reflecting funding above the President's request but below the previous year's appropriation. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence to improve coordination in the intelligence community following the 9/11 attacks. The act addressed the findings of the 9/11 Commission regarding inadequate coordination and the need for a more agile information gathering network. Congress debated the recommendations of the commission, particularly focusing on the authorities of the DNI in managing and budgeting for technical collection systems. Ultimately, many of the commission's recommendations were adopted with a compromise provision to respect existing statutory authorities. The intelligence community, as defined by 50 U.S.C. 401a(4), includes various agencies such as the CIA, NSA, NGA, and FBI, among others. For more details on intelligence community reform and oversight issues, refer to Appendix A of the report. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Department of Homeland Security, along with other intelligence offices/agencies in Cabinet departments, support intelligence community activities. The CIA remains central to analytic efforts globally, producing studies for national security policymakers and conducting covert actions as directed by the President. The Department of Defense houses three major intelligence agencies - NSA, NRO, and NGA. The National Security Agency (NSA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) are key players in the national intelligence budget. NSA focuses on signals intelligence globally, NRO operates reconnaissance satellites, and NGA provides geospatial data for military precision targeting. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) handles defense attach\u00e9s and analytical products for the Department of Defense. The Intelligence Reform Act gives budgetary authority to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) but does not remove the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is known for high-quality analysis. The FBI's key intelligence functions focus on counterterrorism and counterintelligence, with a significant increase in importance post-September 2001. The organization has hired new analysts and reorganized to prioritize intelligence functions over traditional law enforcement efforts. Law enforcement information, including counterterrorism and counterintelligence data, is now shared with other intelligence agencies for comprehensive analysis. Military intelligence services and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) provide supplementary analysis on military and technical issues, enhancing the work of CIA analysts. The Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to fuse law enforcement and intelligence information. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for fusing law enforcement and intelligence information on terrorist threats. The FBI and DHS work together to ensure state and local law enforcement receive intelligence on terrorist threats. The Coast Guard, now part of DHS, focuses on maritime security. The Energy Department analyzes nuclear weapons programs and energy security. The Treasury Department collects information on fiscal and monetary policies and terrorist financing. Intelligence authorization bills were enacted from FY1979 to FY2005, providing guidance to intelligence agencies. No intelligence authorization legislation was enacted between December 2004 and October 2010. Between December 2004 and October 2010, there was a lack of intelligence authorization acts, leading to key intelligence issues being addressed in defense-related acts. However, in recent years, Congress has passed Intelligence Authorization bills for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, which included classified authorizations and were signed into law. The most recent bill, S. 3454 for FY2013, was signed into law in January 2013. Key issues debated during the passage of these bills included... The Intelligence Authorization bills for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 were passed into law between December 2004 and October 2010. Key issues debated during the passage of these bills included the adequacy of DNI authorities, GAO audit authority over the Intelligence Community, and measures to combat national security leaks. The DNI is tasked with eliminating waste and unnecessary duplication within the intelligence community, but some believe this responsibility has been neglected, leading to redundancy in intelligence organizations. Redundancy in intelligence serves important functions, such as ensuring due diligence in identifying and disrupting terror plots. Competitive analysis helps check biases and avoid single points of failure in strategic analysis. Maintaining a balance between eliminating unnecessary redundancy and fostering a competitive environment is crucial for effective intelligence operations. The 113th Congress faces the challenge of maintaining effective intelligence operations by balancing the need to eliminate unnecessary redundancy while fostering a competitive environment. Reforms such as the USA Patriot Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 have improved information sharing within the intelligence community. Intelligence successes and failures indicate progress in this area, with a focus on maximizing access to intelligence information. The 113th Congress is working on maintaining effective intelligence operations by balancing the need to eliminate redundancy and foster competition. Reforms like the USA Patriot Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 have improved information sharing within the intelligence community. Intelligence successes and failures show progress in maximizing access to intelligence information. John Brennan highlighted the high level of sharing between intelligence agencies, DOD, and law enforcement partners. The challenge now is dealing with information overload rather than a lack of sharing. Analysts must connect small data points within large volumes of intelligence traffic. In the Senate report on the Christmas day bombing attempt, Senators noted the challenge analysts faced in searching through vast amounts of terrorism-related intelligence. This problem was also seen after the 2009 Foot Hood shooting. The fusion of domestic and foreign intelligence, along with new information technologies, has made it harder to sift through data. Congress may need to review changes made by the intelligence community since 2009 to address this issue. Intelligence is now deeply integrated into military operations, requiring analysts to sift through large volumes of data. The Persian Gulf War highlighted the importance of intelligence in military operations, including satellite systems. Despite technical difficulties, improvements have been made with congressional support. A 2012 report by the President's Intelligence Advisory Board raised concerns that the CIA and the intelligence community have become too focused on tactical military operations, neglecting strategic intelligence gathering. The DNI is responsible for establishing intelligence community priorities and ensuring proper allocation of resources. Some argue that the focus on counterterrorism may not accurately reflect resource allocation. Intelligence agencies collect vast amounts of information daily, aiding in military capabilities. The intelligence community can provide knowledge quickly, but some mysteries remain unknowable. The emergence of international terrorism has posed challenges to intelligence agencies. The emergence of international terrorism has posed challenges to intelligence agencies, leading to the establishment of the National Clandestine Service at the CIA to enhance human intelligence capabilities. Congressional concerns also exist regarding major technical systems like reconnaissance satellites, with budgetary implications. Intelligence agencies and their targets now heavily rely on commercial technologies. The intelligence community faces challenges in acquiring new satellites and providing accurate analysis in a timely manner. There are debates on the quality of analysis, with some pointing to past failures like the 9/11 attacks and flawed estimates of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Congressional committees have noted weaknesses in analysis, language skills, and a focus on current intelligence over strategic analysis. Funding for analytical offices has increased since 9/11, and the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 includes provisions to address these issues. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 includes provisions to improve analysis, such as red team analyses, ensuring timely and objective intelligence products, and providing support for analysts. However, challenges remain in training analysts, maintaining tradecraft standards, and avoiding groupthink. The quality of intelligence analysis may be tested by emerging national security challenges like Iran's nuclear program. The 113th Congress faces national security challenges related to Iran's nuclear program and budgetary issues affecting intelligence activities. Oversight of the Intelligence Reform Act implementation, monitoring the DNI and CIA Director relationship, and assessing post-9/11 intelligence elements are key areas of congressional interest. Future satellite procurement programs, unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and efforts to prevent such disclosures are ongoing concerns for Congress. The committee called for new provisions to prevent unauthorized disclosures and urged the executive branch to investigate and prosecute those responsible. The CIA's role in targeted killings may face scrutiny as transparency and accountability are balanced with the need to combat al-Qaeda. The Benghazi attack raised intelligence issues, with debates focusing on whether it was a terrorist attack and if there was a protest prior to it. The intelligence community's analytic judgments were questioned regarding the incident. The intelligence community initially assessed incorrectly that a protest had occurred after the Benghazi attack on September 12, but later revised their assessment to confirm it was a deliberate terrorist attack. Analysts faced challenges in making judgments based on incomplete information, with the nature of intelligence work requiring assessments to evolve as new information emerges. This incident highlighted the need for improved performance following past failures in providing advance warning of attacks and flawed intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The Benghazi attack assessment highlighted the need for improved intelligence analysis. Congressional oversight focuses on the intelligence community's analytic tradecraft and past failures. Oversight questions include the validity of the initial protest judgment and the credibility of protest information. U.S. counterterrorism efforts heavily rely on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for intelligence collection and targeted strikes. These drones provide real-time intelligence and can launch weapons at designated targets, operated remotely to avoid direct combat and diplomatic complications. Military services and intelligence agencies use UAVs based on operational and statutory considerations. The use of UAVs in targeted attacks has raised concerns about legality, effectiveness, and potential backlash. Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of targets, international law violations, and the legal basis for strikes against U.S. citizens. Critics warn that drone attacks may fuel opposition to U.S. policy goals and bolster terrorist ranks. Former DNI Blair highlighted the risk of civilian casualties and negative perceptions in countries like Pakistan. In the aftermath of the September 2001 attacks, the FBI faced criticism for its failure to prioritize the terrorist threat, collect and analyze intelligence strategically, and share information with other agencies. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III implemented reforms to enhance the agency's intelligence capabilities, but Congress remains concerned about the effectiveness of these changes and the FBI's information technology acquisition efforts. These issues were highlighted after the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, where the FBI had prior information about the shooter but did not fully share it with the Department of Defense or other agencies. The Senate investigation into the Fort Hood shooting found that the FBI's transformation to become intelligence-driven is incomplete, facing internal challenges like cultural barriers. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within the Department of Homeland Security to identify and assess terrorist threats. The Directorate has since been divided into two components, with intelligence functions falling to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A). The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was established in January 2003 under the DCI and later transferred in accordance with Executive Order 13354 and the Intelligence Reform Act. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) was established as the focal point for assessing terrorist threats from all sources, distinct from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A). The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) has significant authorities for directing intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense, including coordination with special forces for human intelligence collection efforts. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) has considerable intelligence budgetary and hiring authority, sometimes rivaling or exceeding that of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The relationship between the USD(I) and the DNI is influenced by personal relationships and temperament, raising concerns about institutional arrangements and statutory responsibilities. This dynamic may continue to be a focus of congressional interest. Some observers are concerned about potential interference between DOD and CIA humint collection efforts. Intelligence officials claim there is no unnecessary duplication and emphasize coordination. DOD's administration of intelligence personnel has been questioned, leading to the creation of a Defense Clandestine Service to focus on humint operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee moved to limit DOD's human intelligence growth in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2013 froze funding for DOD's human intelligence personnel growth, despite significant expansion post-9/11. Concerns were raised about DOD's unmet needs and the requirement for Congress to be informed of intelligence activities. The House Intelligence Committee proposed removing the \"Gang of Eight\" provisions for covert actions, requiring all committee members to be briefed on intelligence activities unless the committee decides otherwise. This has sparked controversy, with some arguing that all committee members should be notified of non-covert intelligence activities as well. The Administration opposed Section 321, arguing it restricts the President's ability to protect sensitive intelligence activities. The FY2010 intelligence authorization bill requires notification of covert actions and intelligence activities, with frustration expressed by Members over lack of consultation. Members demanded to see legal opinions on the targeted killing program during John Brennan's confirmation as CIA Director. The Administration faced scrutiny over its targeted killing program and the withholding of legal opinions. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information led to tighter restrictions in the Senate Intelligence Authorization legislation. The bill focused on preventing leaks, defining consequences, and revising the definition of \"intelligence agency.\" Most provisions related to unauthorized disclosures were removed from the final bill. The White House released a National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding to address unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The Government Accountability Office has the authority to audit public funds but has exceptions for intelligence activities. Some members believe the GAO should have a role in intelligence oversight, but administrations have resisted expanding its responsibilities. The Bush and Obama Administrations have opposed proposals to expand the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) role in intelligence oversight. Despite this opposition, provisions for an expanded GAO role were included in the Senate and House FY2011 Intelligence Authorization bills. An amendment was added to the FY2011 Defense Authorization bill requiring the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide the GAO with necessary information for analysis. The approved version of H.R. 2701 mandated the DNI to issue a directive by May 2011 governing GAO access to intelligence agency information. The DNI issued Intelligence Community Directive Number 114 on April 29, 2011, to encourage cooperation between GAO and intelligence agencies. However, the directive restricts information access for GAO audits of core national intelligence capabilities. GAO expressed concerns that broad interpretation by intelligence agencies could hinder their work. Congress may need to assess the impact and interpretation of ICD 114 on GAO access to intelligence information. The NSA at Fort Meade, MD is responsible for sigint collection, which has evolved to target terrorist groups using advanced encryption systems. Lieutenant General Michael Hayden initiated a reorganization of the agency to adapt to changing conditions, including early retirements and outsourcing functions previously done by career personnel. The NSA at Fort Meade, MD is responsible for sigint collection, targeting terrorist groups with advanced encryption systems. Lieutenant General Michael Hayden reorganized the agency, leading to early retirements and outsourcing functions. The imagery discipline, collected by satellites, manned aircraft, and UAVs, faces changes with a greater number of collection targets. Commercial satellite imagery raises questions about meeting intelligence agencies' requirements. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) was established in 1996 to manage imagery processing and dissemination previously undertaken by separate agencies. NGA's goal is to use imagery and geospatial information to describe physical features and activities on Earth. The CIA is the primary collector of human intelligence (humint), but the Defense Department also plays a role through defense attach\u00e9s and other agents. Critics argue that inadequate humint has been a systemic issue, contributing to the lack of prior knowledge of the 9/11 plots. The changing nature of the international environment has led to criticisms of the inability to gain prior knowledge of the 9/11 plots. Today, the need for humint collection is to seek information from clandestine terrorist groups or narcotics traffickers. Placing U.S. intelligence officials under \"nonofficial cover\" presents significant challenges due to complicated administrative mechanisms. The responsibilities of operatives under nonofficial cover to the parent intelligence agency must be balanced with those to private employers, leading to potential conflicts of interest and corruption. Concerns about CIA agents' involvement with terrorist groups or smugglers in Central America led to the establishment of guidelines by the then-Director of Central Intelligence in 1995. These guidelines, which remain classified, aimed to govern the recruitment of informants with questionable backgrounds. The FY2002 Intelligence Authorization Act directed the DCI to rescind and replace these guidelines, as they were believed to create a \"risk averse\" atmosphere hindering the acquisition of valuable information on terrorist plans. The intelligence community faces challenges in humint collection due to a lack of personnel trained in needed languages. Various solutions have been considered, such as using civilian contractors, military reservists, and offering bonuses for language proficiency. The National Security Education Program provides scholarships for individuals pursuing careers in national security agencies. Masint, a technical discipline involving analytical refinements to information collected by sensors, has gained importance in recent years. Masint, undertaken by DIA and other DOD agencies, faces challenges in retaining personnel with expertise. Open source information (osint) is increasingly important for gathering information about various regions and topics. Intelligence agencies should be more aggressive in using osint, which may reduce the need for certain collection efforts. The availability of osint raises questions about the necessity of intelligence agencies to collect information that could be obtained directly by user agencies. The Intelligence Reform Act called for the establishment of an Open Source Center to coordinate the collection and dissemination of open source intelligence. Challenges in sharing data among different intelligence agencies have been attributed to technical issues and security concerns. The Intelligence Sharing Environment (ISE) was mandated to improve the sharing of terrorism-related information. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 removed barriers between foreign intelligence and law enforcement information, allowing for sharing of law enforcement information with intelligence agencies. The Homeland Security Act and subsequent creation of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center aimed to combine information from both sources. The Intelligence Reform Act established the National Counterterrorism Center to analyze and integrate all intelligence for counterterrorism efforts. The National Counterterrorism Center is responsible for analyzing and integrating intelligence related to terrorism and counterterrorism for the US Government. Intelligence spending is divided between the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), with most of the $50+ billion in national intelligence spending hidden within the Department of Defense budget. Intelligence programs are described in classified annexes to legislation. Intelligence spending is authorized in intelligence authorization acts, with most spending authorized by a \"catch-all\" provision in defense appropriations acts when legislation is not enacted. Attempts to make total intelligence spending public were unsuccessful, with only limited information disclosed in response to a lawsuit. The National Counterterrorism Center analyzes terrorism-related intelligence, with most of the $50+ billion national intelligence spending hidden within the Department of Defense budget. Intelligence programs are detailed in classified annexes to legislation. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2007 required the DNI to disclose the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The NIP budget for FY2008 was $47.5 billion, FY2009 was $49.8 billion, and FY2010 was $53.1 billion. In 2009, DNI Blair stated that total annual intelligence spending, including military intelligence activities, was $75 billion. The NIP budget for FY2010 was $53.1 billion, with subsequent announcements stating that the MIP appropriations for FY2010 were $27 billion. In FY2011, the MIP budget was $24 billion, a $3 billion reduction from the previous year. The NIP budget for FY2011 was $54.6 billion, and for FY2012 it was $53.9 billion. The requested NIP budget for FY2013 was $52.6 billion. The Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over the NIP, while the House Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over both NIP and MIP programs. Intelligence spending is mainly done by agencies within DOD, involving the armed services committees in both chambers. The oversight process for intelligence agencies involves various committees in Congress, including the armed services committees and appropriations committees. Funds for intelligence activities are included in national defense appropriations acts, with specific allocations for agencies like the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA. There have been discussions about establishing a dedicated Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence, but this has not been implemented. The House approved a select panel within the appropriations committee to oversee intelligence program appropriations, but it was not continued in the 112th Congress. Intelligence budgeting issues have been a key focus in intelligence reform legislation debates. Budgeting issues were central to the 2004 debate on intelligence reform legislation. The goal was to make the new DNI responsible for the National Intelligence Program budget, separate from the Defense budget. The final version of P.L. 108-458 granted broad budgetary authorities to the DNI, with guidelines to respect statutory responsibilities of other agencies. The Intelligence Reform Act granted budgetary authorities to the DNI, aligning intelligence budget submissions with the Defense Department. Congressional acts in 2011 further facilitated the DNI's management of intelligence accounts and strengthened oversight. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the Senate and House intelligence committees conducted a joint investigation into the attacks. The inquiry found that while there were general indications of a possible terrorist attack, the Intelligence Community did not have specific information prior to 9/11. The findings were published by the committees. The Joint Inquiry by the intelligence committees after 9/11 found a steady stream of intelligence on possible terrorist attacks in the US. It highlighted the lack of preparedness in the intelligence community and recommended creating a separate Director of National Intelligence position. The Joint Inquiry after 9/11 recommended creating a separate Director of National Intelligence position with greater authority over intelligence agencies in the Defense Department. A new domestic surveillance agency similar to Britain's MI5 was also suggested. An independent commission on the 2001 terrorist attacks was established, with the report published in July 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing a National Intelligence Director (NID) to manage the National Intelligence Program and oversee agencies contributing to it. The NID would submit a national intelligence program budget, nominate heads of major intelligence agencies to the President, and assign paramilitary operations to the DOD instead of the CIA. The commission also suggested a separate annual appropriations act for intelligence, a single intelligence committee in each house of Congress, and President Bush signed executive orders addressing these recommendations in August 2004. Bush addressed key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission by signing executive orders to reform intelligence, including establishing a National Counterterrorism Center and providing new authorities for the DCI. Legislative proposals were introduced to create a National Intelligence Director separate from the CIA Director. The Intelligence Reform Act, signed into law in December 2004, focused on the authorities of the Director of National Intelligence regarding budgets and operations of major intelligence agencies in the DOD. Ongoing implementation of the Act will continue to receive oversight during the 113th Congress. In December 2005, media reports of NSA electronic surveillance outside of FISA parameters led to criticism of the Bush Administration. The Administration defended the monitoring of communications involving suspected Al Qaeda members in the US based on constitutional authority and the Joint Resolution of September 18, 2001. Some argued that FISA should have governed such surveillance. In March 2006, an agreement was reached with intelligence committees to address the issue. In 2006, an agreement was reached with intelligence committees to enhance oversight of NSA surveillance. The Bush Administration informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that electronic surveillance would now require FISC approval. The Administration also proposed revising FISA to adapt to modern communication technologies, sparking differing views among Senate Intelligence Committee members. In 2007, the FISA legislation was debated due to differing views on surveillance technologies. A judge ruled that FISC approval was needed for surveillance of foreign communications passing through the US. The DNI argued against court orders for collecting foreign intelligence. The Protect America Act excluded certain surveillance from FISA's definition of electronic surveillance. The Protect America Act, which expired in 2008, allowed the DNI and Attorney General to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons outside the US, including US persons. The DNI and AG had to certify that this acquisition did not constitute electronic surveillance, with oversight and reporting requirements to congressional committees. The Protect America Act (P.L. 110-55) expired on February 1, 2008, and efforts to extend it failed. The House rejected H.R. 5349 on February 13. Acquisitions authorized under the PAA can continue until their expiration. The RESTORE Act (H.R. 3773) was passed to clarify that court orders are not required for certain communications acquisitions. The RESTORE Act aimed to increase oversight on intelligence agencies and required quarterly audits by the Justice Department's Inspector General. The Senate Intelligence Committee proposed a FISA amendment allowing targeting of individuals outside the US for foreign intelligence information. FISC approval would be needed for targeting US persons believed to be outside the US. The Senate bill aimed to allow intelligence agencies located outside the US to conduct electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence information, with FISC oversight. It also included retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies. The central issue was the role of the judiciary in overseeing surveillance involving US persons. The Senate bill aimed to allow intelligence agencies outside the US to conduct electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence information with FISC oversight. The House approved an amendment requiring judicial review by the FISC for targeting non-US persons located outside the US, even if not believed to be communicating with a US person. The House-passed amendment required FISC approval for targeting non-U.S. persons outside the U.S., with a 90-day period for acquisition renewals. It did not grant retroactive immunity to telecom companies but allowed them to defend themselves in court. Additionally, it proposed establishing a commission on warrantless electronic surveillance activities post-9/11. Between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, electronic surveillance activities were conducted. A new bill, H.R. 6304, was introduced on June 19, 2008, strengthening the role of the FISC in intelligence surveillance approval. It provided telecom companies a chance to prove their actions were in response to executive branch requests. H.R. 6304 was passed by the House and Senate in 2008, becoming P.L. 110-261. FISA provisions were extended multiple times until June 1, 2015. Between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, electronic surveillance activities were conducted. A new bill, H.R. 6304, was introduced on June 19, 2008, strengthening the role of the FISC in intelligence surveillance approval. It provided telecom companies a chance to prove their actions were in response to executive branch requests. H.R. 6304 was passed by the House and Senate in 2008, becoming P.L. 110-261. FISA provisions were extended multiple times until June 1, 2015. Various intelligence-related acts and reports were issued by the U.S. Congress during this period, including the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006. Between 2005 and 2011, several Intelligence Authorization Acts were passed by the U.S. Congress, including those for fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Additionally, a report on Counterterrorism Intelligence Capabilities and Performance Prior to 9-11 was issued by the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security in July 2002. Several Intelligence Authorization Acts were passed by the U.S. Congress between 2005 and 2011 for fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Additionally, a report on Counterterrorism Intelligence Capabilities and Performance Prior to 9-11 was issued by the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security in July 2002. The U.S. Congress passed several Intelligence Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Additionally, reports on the Attempted Terrorist Attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 and FBI Security Programs were issued."
