    "content": "A presidential transition involves the transfer of executive power from the incumbent President to the successor, starting with pre-election planning and continuing through inauguration day. It includes vetting candidates, familiarizing the incoming Administration with operations, and developing a policy platform. The importance of a well-organized transition was highlighted after the 9/11 attacks. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security emphasized the need for transition planning to prevent security vulnerabilities. The challenges and risks of presidential transitions have increased since 2010. Historically, transitions lacked advance planning and cooperation from the sitting president. Candidates often avoid pre-election planning to avoid criticism or resource strain. Recognizing the importance of a well-planned transition is growing. The necessity of a well-planned transition to a new Administration has led to a shift in stakeholders' perspectives. Pre-election planning has become crucial due to the limited time between the general election and inauguration day. Legislation like the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 aims to normalize and facilitate pre-election transition planning for a successful transition process. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 and its amendments provide services and facilities to transition teams, establishing formal mechanisms for presidential transitions. The Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 authorizes support for eligible candidates, establishes transition councils, and provides facilities and services to the incoming Administration. This commitment highlights the importance of a successful presidential transition for the continuity of government operations. The incoming President is responsible for over 4,000 appointments and managing a $4 trillion budget with 2 million employees across various missions. The complexity of the federal government is evident in the numerous agencies and departments. In 2008, there were 7,854 positions to be filled by the President and White House staff, including appointees requiring Senate confirmation, judicial appointees, White House staff, and noncareer positions. During the 2009 presidential transition, national security was a major concern due to potential terrorist threats. The FBI briefed senior officials on a possible attack on the National Mall during Barack Obama's inauguration. Despite the robust federal government, adversaries perceived vulnerabilities during transitions. Amendments to the Presidential Transition Act aimed to enhance preparedness for such threats. Amendments to the Presidential Transition Act have addressed the federal government's readiness for transition-related incidents and the incoming Administration's responsibility for national security post-inauguration. The most recent amendment, P.L. 114-136, required a report on threats and vulnerabilities during a presidential transition. Another amendment mandates officials to provide a summary of specific threats to national security and military operations to the President-elect. For a sitting President not reelected, election day marks the beginning of the end of their presidency. Howell and Mayer argue that a lame duck President can still make significant policy changes through executive orders and other directives before the inauguration day. The level of activity of an outgoing President is influenced by the party of their successor, with more urgency seen when the successor is from a different party. During the last one hundred days of a presidential administration, the incumbent may enact policies and make changes that could hinder his successor. This period of political certainty occurs when the outgoing president knows who will succeed him and rushes to implement last-minute policies. Throughout history, there have been 18 presidential transitions, with 11 being interparty transitions. Regardless of the incumbent's intentions, his decisions during this time can have a significant impact. During the last one hundred days of a presidential administration, the incumbent may enact policies and make changes that could hinder his successor. This period of political certainty occurs when the outgoing president knows who will succeed him and rushes to implement last-minute policies. The President can issue executive orders, appoint individuals to positions, influence agency rulemaking, and make significant decisions regarding records. Some actions may question the propriety of an outgoing Administration's actions during the presidential transition period. During the transition period, the incoming President faces challenges in adjusting from campaigning to governing, including staffing, management, agenda setting, and policy formulation. They can use tools like executive orders, agency rulemaking, and political appointments to establish their policy agenda and potentially overturn or modify predecessor's policies. The submission and revision of the budget by the sitting President also add to the tasks of the newly elected President. The transition period is crucial for the President-elect as they navigate the shift in power and make key decisions. Since the modern presidency, actions taken by presidents-elect before inauguration day have been crucial for their success in office. Congress plays a role in presidential transitions through appointee confirmations, budget processes, and oversight of agency rulemaking. Other activities like executive orders, record disposition, and pardons may also be of interest to Congress. The sections in this report are grouped into three categories, covering various transition-related topics and issues. The report categorizes transition-related issues into three groups: those involving the outgoing Administration (personnel, government records, executive clemency), cybersecurity and national security issues, and issues spanning both outgoing and incoming Administrations (agency rulemaking, appointments, executive orders, budget submission). \"Burrowing in\" refers to the practice of appointees transitioning from noncareer to career positions, following laws and regulations. These conversions often occur during the transition period between Administrations. The curr_chunk discusses the different types of positions within the government, such as Schedule C, noncareer SES, and limited tenure SES, each with varying salary levels and job security. Career employees are selected based on merit and have more job stability compared to noncareer employees. Paul Light's study in 2007 highlighted the differences in pay, benefits, and job security between career and noncareer positions. The conversion of individuals from noncareer to career positions in government may lead to concerns about limiting opportunities for other employees and potential conflicts with new administrations. This practice, known as \"burrowing in,\" can create tension between noncareer and career staff, hindering the effective operation of government. The importance of effective working relationships between noncareer and career staff in public administration is emphasized. The Senior Executives Association highlights the role of career executives as the link between policy and implementation. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by laws and regulations. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch must adhere to strict procedures to prevent prohibited personnel practices and ensure fairness. Department and agency heads are responsible for enforcing civil service laws and regulations, including the 9 merit principles and 13 prohibited personnel practices. Regulations such as Civil Service Rules 4.2 and 7.1 prohibit discrimination and govern appointing officers' discretion in filling vacancies. During the Presidential Election Period from June 1, 2016, to January 20, 2017, certain appointees, including noncareer SES, Schedule C employees in policy-determining roles, and limited-term appointees, are prohibited from receiving financial awards. Career positions conversions must adhere to strict procedures to prevent prohibited personnel practices. OPM and GAO oversee conversions of employees from noncareer to career positions to ensure proper procedures are followed. OPM requires approval for political appointees in competitive service positions during a Presidential election year. In a significant change to the policy, departments and agencies now need prior approval from OPM to appoint current or recent political appointees to competitive or non-political excepted service positions. This policy took effect on January 1, 2010, requiring a written authorization from OPM for such appointments. OPM requires agencies to review proposed career SES selections involving political appointees before presenting them to the QRB for certification. Director John Berry emphasized the importance of upholding merit system principles and delegated decision-making authority to career Senior Executives at OPM to avoid political influence. Pre-Appointment Checklists were included as attachments to the OPM memorandum for the 2016 presidential election year. In January 2016, OPM issued a memorandum cautioning departments and agencies against creating vacancies solely to appoint political appointees or removing elements of a position to facilitate such appointments. The memorandum also reiterated policies from a November 2009 memorandum and referenced the Presidential Transition Guide for Federal Human Resources Management Matters. Additionally, the Edward \"Ted\" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvement Act of 2015 requires the OPM Director to provide annual reports to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental. The OPM Director is required to provide annual reports to Senate and House committees on requests for political appointees to civil service positions. Quarterly reports are also required, with the last one covering January 1 to January 20 of the following year. The Director can exclude names of appointees if deemed appropriate. The GAO conducts periodic reviews of conversions from political to career positions at federal agencies. A recent evaluation covered the period from January 1, 2010, to October 1, 2015, and found that 69 conversions occurred at 30 agencies. The majority of conversions took place in six agencies, with individuals being converted to various career positions. The GAO reviewed conversions from political to career positions at federal agencies, finding that 69 conversions occurred at 30 agencies from 2010 to 2015. Eight agencies converted 17 political appointees to career positions without OPM approval due to difficulty understanding the policy. Congress monitors these conversions before and after presidential elections, with oversight ongoing for the 2016 election. Representative Ken Buck introduced H.R. 1132 regarding political appointee conversions. Representative Ken Buck introduced H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, to establish a two-year prohibition on certain appointees from moving to career Civil Service positions. This aims to maintain merit-based hiring standards in the federal civil service. Additionally, Representative Jason Chaffetz requested information on job openings and hiring practices at various government agencies. Representative Chaffetz raised concerns about the acceleration of hiring for civil service positions and the potential influence of political factors. Senators Johnson and Tillis urged President Obama to consider a hiring freeze for career civil servant positions, except those related to public health or safety, to prevent unfair advantages and potential undermining of the new president's policies. Senator Johnson requested a list of federal employees who converted from political appointments to career positions to ensure merit-based federal employment and protect the independence of the civil service. Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady also sought information on personnel conversions of noncareer employees from various government departments. The Members of Congress requested information on conversions of noncareer employees within government agencies from January 1, 2009, to present. They also asked for a list of corrective actions requested by OPM and their status. Additionally, they requested the GAO to review political appointee conversions to career federal civil service positions from June 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015. The Members of Congress requested a review by GAO on political appointee conversions to career civil service positions from June 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015. The review was prompted by concerns about political appointees 'burrowing in' to positions that should be awarded based on merit, potentially compromising the integrity of the federal workforce. Timothy Dirks of the Senior Executives Association supported the review, emphasizing the importance of expertise and experience in senior government positions. Some political appointees may be placed in Senior Executive positions for which they are unqualified, leading to non-meritorious selections. Transparency in the conversion process can help prevent abuse. GAO's findings prompted a joint press release emphasizing the importance of following rules. The watchdog's findings revealed that a quarter of political appointees who burrowed into the executive branch did not follow the rules, prompting concerns about favoritism and bias in government operations. Lawmakers emphasized the need for proper procedures to ensure hiring decisions are free from political interference and based on merit. GAO's recommendation for a more stringent verification process for conversions was supported to uphold the integrity of a merit-based federal workforce and prevent cronyism. The practice of burrowing in was criticized for threatening the integrity of the federal workforce and the importance of hiring based on merit rather than political beliefs was highlighted. The administration must ensure fairness and competition in federal service by potentially amending policies and increasing penalties for violating civil service laws. Congress may direct OPM to report on conversions from appointed to career positions and assess the need for changes in financial awards to senior politically appointed officers during the Presidential Election Period. The penalties for violating civil service laws may be increased, including creating a misdemeanor offense for agency personnel who violate federal hiring statutes. Congress could direct OPM to provide training on policies to federal managers and supervisors. Additionally, standardized reports on conversions from appointed to career positions could be requested to ensure oversight. The laws and policies governing government records, including agency federal records and presidential records, are overseen by the Archivist of the United States. The transition between presidential administrations raises concerns about the preservation and access of federal records. The transition between presidential administrations raises concerns about the preservation and access of federal records, especially with the updated definition of federal records introduced in 2014. This new definition broadens the scope of what constitutes a federal record, encompassing all recorded information made or received by a Federal agency in connection with public business. The amended definition of federal records broadens the scope to include all recorded information regardless of form or characteristic. Federal agency staff must ensure proper capture and retention of records. The transition to a new President may not directly impact federal records collection and retention at executive branch agencies. The transition to a new President may not directly impact federal records collection and retention at executive branch agencies. Political appointees must ensure proper management and preservation of federal records created during their tenure. The Obama Administration's use of various electronic platforms has made record collection and retention more complex. Various guidance on records collection and retention was issued during the Obama Administration. Federal government agencies are required to implement NARA's records management guidance for existing and new federal records. The 2012 \"Managing Government Records Directive\" mandated that executive branch agencies manage all email records electronically by 2016 and all permanent electronic records by 2019. GAO reported in 2015 that 5 out of 24 agencies had not met these requirements. NARA established the Capstone approach in 2013 to help agencies manage email electronically by treating senior officials' emails as permanent records. Guidance was also released on managing social media records and unlawful removal of records. NARA issues bulletins to remind agencies of proper records management regulations, including which records must remain in custody during presidential transitions. The 2008 bulletin allowed departing officials to remove records with approval, but restricted materials must be maintained according to agency requirements. Criminal penalties exist for unauthorized removal or destruction of federal records. NARA re-issued guidance in 2016 on proper management of federal records, emphasizing employees' responsibilities. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 established that presidential records are government property and transfer to the Archivist when a President leaves office. NARA works with various White House offices to manage records dating back to President Reagan. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 dictates that presidential records are government property and transfer to the Archivist when a President leaves office. White House offices and the Office of the Vice President coordinate on moving records and artifacts, preparing them for eventual transfer to NARA. Presidential records include various materials created or received by the President and their staff, with no limitation on format. The Act does not affect any constitutionally-based privilege available to an incumbent or former President. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 dictates that presidential records are government property and transfer to the Archivist when a President leaves office. The Act does not affect any constitutionally-based privilege available to an incumbent or former President. Successive presidential Administrations have interpreted the Act differently, with the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 codifying some parts of the Act. This includes providing a 60-day review period to the incumbent and applicable former President before the Archivist can publicly release previously unreleased presidential records. The Presidential Records Act of 1978 mandates that presidential records become government property and are transferred to the Archivist when a President leaves office. The Act allows for a 60-day review period for the incumbent and former President before releasing unreleased records. The law also requires any claim of executive privilege to be made by the former or incumbent President. Additionally, P.L. 113-187 prohibits individuals convicted of mishandling NARA records from accessing presidential records. NARA has faced challenges managing the increasing volume and varied electronic formats of records from each Administration. The volume of digital records created by administrations poses a challenge for organization and accessibility. The George W. Bush administration transferred 77 terabytes of data to NARA, much more than the Clinton administration. NARA is responsible for preserving records of former Presidents, including social media content. The George W. Bush Library and Museum received over 70 million pages of textual records, 43,000 artifacts, 200 million emails, and 4 million digital photographs. The transfer of electronic records during presidential transitions is complex due to the increasing volume and variety of records generated. Executive clemency, including presidential pardons, commutations, remissions, and reprieves, is granted by the President for federal offenses. The President has broad discretion in exercising executive clemency, with limitations only applying to violations of federal laws. The President has broad discretion in granting executive clemency for federal offenses, with limitations only applying to violations of federal laws. Presidents historically increase clemency grants in the final months of their term, with controversial acts sometimes being granted during this period. In the final months of an Administration, controversial acts of clemency have been granted, potentially impeding ongoing investigations into executive branch officials. President G.H.W. Bush pardoned key figures in the Iran-Contra affair, effectively ending a criminal investigation. President G.W. Bush commuted the sentences of Border Patrol agents convicted of shooting a Mexican citizen, despite opposition from Mexico. The commutation of sentences for Border Patrol agents by President G.W. Bush was criticized by Mexico's assistant foreign minister for North American affairs. The importance of U.S. cybersecurity as a critical element of national security has been highlighted in various national security strategies and assessments. The presidential transition period may present challenges in cybersecurity, especially if a cybersecurity incident occurs during the transition. The federal government faces challenges in filling cybersecurity positions promptly. A coordinated incident response architecture is crucial for preparing for and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. Presidential Policy Directive 41 outlines principles for incident response, emphasizing shared responsibility, risk assessment, and safeguarding sensitive information. Presidential Policy Directive 41 outlines principles for incident response, emphasizing shared responsibility, risk assessment, and safeguarding sensitive information. The directive establishes federal agency lines of effort, with the Department of Justice leading Threat Response, Department of Homeland Security leading Asset Response, and intelligence support activities for threat and asset response. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) leads threat and asset response activities, with the Department of Defense (DOD) as the lead for the Defense Industrial Base critical infrastructure sector. PPD-41 does not specify agencies' unique responsibilities beyond incident response. The intelligence community provides briefings to presidential candidates aligned with the \"Worldwide Threat Assessment\" report. The 2016 \"Threat Assessment\" report to Congress highlighted cybersecurity threats, including challenges from the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and targeting of personally identifiable information. Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and nonstate actors were identified as the top threat actors. Concerns were raised about the cybersecurity qualifications of executive branch political appointees, particularly agency heads, and the responsibility of all federal agency heads to protect their systems, data, and networks. In recent years, agency heads have been included in cybersecurity hearings by Congress, highlighting their managerial responsibilities for budget and resource prioritization. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) have explicit responsibilities for information technology security in federal agencies. The Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) addresses cybersecurity vacancies and the need for agencies to plan for them. PPD-41 establishes coordination groups to address cybersecurity incidents. The presidential transition period poses both opportunities and risks to national security. During the presidential transition period, collaboration between the current and new Administration is crucial for safeguarding U.S. interests and national security. The change in leadership can impact policies and international security, creating opportunities for those who wish to harm U.S. security interests. During the presidential transition period, collaboration between the current and new Administration is crucial for safeguarding U.S. interests and national security. The timing of potential security threats may be influenced by an entity's capability and perceived opportunity. Enhanced cooperation and communication between Administrations are essential for national security and foreign policy concerns during transitions. During the presidential transition period, effective and seamless transitions are crucial to address risks and ensure national security. Modern transition activities extend beyond the election to the establishment of a national security team and policies by the new President. Collaboration between outgoing and incoming Administrations is essential to prevent and respond to any incidents affecting the transition. During presidential transitions, collaboration between outgoing and incoming Administrations is crucial to address risks and ensure national security. The newly elected President's response to challenges will heavily depend on transition planning and learning. Activities during transitions include consulting with experts, providing information to the President-elect, offering operational briefings on national security matters, preparing briefing books, and expediting security clearances for transition team members. Agencies are delegated rulemaking authority by Congress to implement statutes. During presidential transitions, collaboration between outgoing and incoming Administrations is crucial for national security. Agencies are delegated rulemaking authority by Congress to implement statutes, following procedures such as publishing notices in the Federal Register and taking comments on proposed rules. \"Midnight rulemaking\" refers to the increased issuance of regulations by outgoing Administrations, raising concerns about political accountability. During presidential transitions, collaboration between outgoing and incoming Administrations is crucial for national security. Agencies are delegated rulemaking authority by Congress to implement statutes. \"Midnight rulemaking\" refers to the increased issuance of regulations by outgoing Administrations, raising concerns about political accountability. Concerns include the quality of regulations suffering, overwhelming new Administrations, and the need for sufficient time to review public comments. Previous Presidents have imposed controls on rulemaking at the start of their Administrations. During presidential transitions, collaboration between outgoing and incoming Administrations is crucial for national security. Agencies are delegated rulemaking authority by Congress to implement statutes. The imposition of a moratorium on new regulations from executive departments and independent agencies is a common practice at the start of new Administrations. This can include postponing the effective dates of certain rules issued at the end of the previous President's term and withdrawing proposed rules not yet published as final rules. Once final rules are published, a new Administration must go through the rulemaking process again to eliminate or change them. President Reagan and President Clinton both implemented moratoriums on rules issued by their predecessors, highlighting the importance of controlling rulemaking during transitions. During presidential transitions, outgoing Administrations have attempted to protect rules issued in their final months by establishing effective dates before the new Administration takes over. For example, the G.W. Bush Administration delayed the implementation of rules issued by the Clinton Administration, while the Obama Administration requested a postponement of rule effective dates. This practice aims to prevent rules from being rendered ineffective by the incoming Administration. President Obama's OIRA Administrator, Howard Shelanski, urged deputy secretaries to complete high-priority rulemakings by summer 2016 to avoid rushed end-of-year regulations that could lower quality. Congress has the power to overturn or amend regulations, even those already in effect, by changing statutory authority or providing additional instructions to agencies during rule development. Congress has the power to overturn or amend regulations through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or by adding provisions to agency appropriations bills. The CRA requires final rules to be submitted to Congress and the Government Accountability Office before taking effect, allowing members of Congress 60 days to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn regulations within a specific timeframe. Once a joint resolution is passed by both houses and signed by the President, the rule is invalidated and cannot be reissued without authorization. The President can veto a joint resolution, which Congress can override with a two-thirds vote. The Congressional Review Act has only been used once to disapprove a rule. There may be a window at the start of a new administration for Congress to overturn rules. During the period at the start of a new administration, Congress could overturn rules using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or add provisions to agency appropriations bills to impact rulemaking. These provisions often restrict the use of funds for rule development, finalization, implementation, or enforcement. While appropriations provisions can influence agency activities, they do not nullify existing regulations like CRA resolutions do. Regulated entities must comply with federal regulations outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, even if appropriations acts restrict funds for enforcement. Restrictions on fund usage in appropriations acts are typically binding for a specific period and may apply to specific agencies or be government-wide. These restrictions can impact agency rulemaking but do not overturn existing regulations like the Congressional Review Act. The installation of executive branch political appointees and concerns about presidential activity in the last months of an Administration, including the potential for recess appointments that extend into the succeeding presidency, are areas of interest for Congress. Federal regulations may be enforced by state or local governments with independent funding sources, not restricted by appropriations provisions. The President and the Senate share power in appointing top government officials. The appointment process involves nomination by the President, Senate consideration, and confirmation leading to the appointee being sworn in. The President can make temporary appointments if a position is vacant during Senate recess. The President can make temporary appointments during Senate recess, known as recess appointments, which expire at the end of the following Senate session. Recent developments have made it harder for a departing President to use this power, with scheduling practices preventing long enough recesses for appointments. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that recess appointments can only be made during a recess of 10 days or longer, except in rare circumstances. Appointees to executive branch positions usually serve at the pleasure of the President, meaning they can be removed at any time for any reason. Congress can set specific terms or restrictions on the President's power of removal for certain positions. Fixed terms and removal restrictions are more common for regulatory boards and commissions to establish independence from the President. Appointees to executive branch positions typically serve at the pleasure of the President, but some positions with fixed terms and removal protections may span multiple presidencies. The incoming President may only remove appointees with statutory grounds. Outgoing Presidents have made recess appointments to positions without removal protections, with tenure similar to Senate-confirmed appointees. Recess appointees to positions with fixed terms and removal protection may serve until the term expires or the recess appointment ends. A President could use a recess appointment to fill a fixed-term position beyond their presidency. Outgoing Presidents may install controversial appointees who may not be confirmed by the new President or Senate. The possibility of a departing President making a recess appointment, especially when facing opposition in the Senate, raises arguments for and against the practice. Supporters argue that the President has full constitutional authority until the end of their term and should be able to act accordingly. However, critics argue that such appointments could undermine the incoming President and bypass Senate oversight. The Appointments Clause in the Constitution outlines the process for appointing federal judges, where the President nominates and the Senate confirms. This process remains unchanged over centuries, with vacant judgeships awaiting nominations at the start of a new Administration. There are dozens of vacant lower federal court judgeships awaiting nominations by a new President. A vacancy on the Supreme Court exists at the start of a new presidency, which may not be filled before January 20, 2017. The large number of vacant judgeships is due to the Senate approving fewer judicial nominations during an outgoing President's final year in office. The number of vacant circuit court judgeships on January 20 of a newly elected President's first year ranged from 5 to 26 in recent presidencies. During a new presidency, vacant district court judgeships range from 27 to 93, with a lengthy pre-nomination evaluation process involving the White House Counsel's Office, Department of Justice, FBI, and American Bar Association. The selection process can take several months before nominations are submitted to the Senate. During presidential transitions, concerns may arise about the volume, timing, and content of executive orders. There is a perception that outgoing Presidents may increase unilateral actions during this period. Executive orders carry the force of law unless revoked. Executive orders have the force of law and allow the President to establish control over policymaking quickly and forcefully. They can be used to shape the national agenda, bypass a hostile Congress, or secure a President's legacy. Howell and Mayer have observed that outgoing Presidents often utilize executive orders to enact policy changes. When a President's successor is from the opposition party, he may rush to implement last-minute policies to limit the new President's options. Executive orders issued by an outgoing President lack legitimacy and democratic accountability. An incoming President may use executive orders to quickly enact his policy agenda and overturn his predecessor's actions, especially if they are from different parties. During transition periods, incoming Presidents may issue executive orders to quickly enact their policy agenda and amend their predecessor's actions. Comparing data within each column of executive orders issued by Presidents Obama, G.W. Bush, Clinton, G.H.W. Bush, Reagan, and Carter shows variations in the number of orders signed. Trump signed 33 executive orders during the incoming period, nearly doubling Reagan's count. The pre-election period also saw variations in executive orders issued, with Carter leading with 20 orders. The lame duck period showed the greatest variation in executive orders issued. During the lame duck period, Presidents Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, G.W. Bush, and Obama issued fewer than 20 executive orders each. Clinton issued 22, and Carter issued 36, with a third related to the Iran hostage crisis. A study from April 1936 to December 1995 found that outgoing Presidents issued more executive orders, especially when succeeded by a different party. This suggests a policy-driven motive for last-minute orders. During transition periods, Presidents issue executive orders for various purposes, ranging from symbolic gestures to significant policy changes. The number of executive orders signed can increase during reelection campaigns, with Presidents using them to establish policy, reorganize agencies, and impact legislation interpretation. Unilateral actions during transitions can result in a mix of executive orders in terms of significance and scope. For example, President Carter selected an FBI director and closed the government, while President Bush designated tasks. During transition periods, Presidents issue executive orders for various purposes, ranging from symbolic gestures to significant policy changes. President Reagan brought agency rulemaking under OMB control and required cost-benefit analyses for proposed rules. President Carter issued executive orders related to the release of American hostages in Iran. The transition from one presidential Administration to another raises special issues regarding the annual budget submission. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with the current deadline set between the first Monday in January and the first Monday in February. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution mandates that each new Congress convene on January 3, aligning with the beginning of a President's four-year term. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with the current deadline set between the first Monday in January and the first Monday in February. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution mandates that each new Congress convene on January 3, aligning with the beginning of a President's four-year term. Under the legal framework, outgoing Presidents were obligated to submit a budget before the 1990 change in the deadline. Since then, outgoing Presidents have the option to leave the budget submission to their successors. President Obama submitted the FY2017 budget, and if he follows his predecessors, the FY2018 budget would be the responsibility of his successor. During presidential transitions, outgoing Presidents have the option to submit a budget before the statutory deadline. In the past, Congress has extended deadlines for budget submissions, but in recent years, some original budgets were submitted late without authorization. For example, the FY1991 budget was submitted a week after an extended deadline, and the FY1989 budget was submitted 45 days late. For FY1989, the budget was submitted 45 days after the deadline without any deadline extension. Transition-year budgets for FY1994, FY2002, and FY2010 were submitted 66, 63, and 98 days late, respectively. Presidents Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama submitted their budgets in April or May of their first year in office. Obama submitted his detailed budget information in May 2009. Since 1921, incoming Presidents have typically assumed office with their predecessor's budget in place. However, some Presidents, such as Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan, chose to submit revisions shortly after taking office. Others, like Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, and G.H.W. Bush, did not submit revisions. Carter and Reagan were the only Presidents since FY1977 to submit revisions of their predecessors' budgets. George H.W. Bush did not officially revise Reagan's FY1990 budget but presented similar elements in a document to Congress during his first State of the Union Address. The State of the Union Address included elements from budget revisions submitted by previous incoming Presidents."
