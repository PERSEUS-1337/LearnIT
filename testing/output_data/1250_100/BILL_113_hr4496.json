Each State must operate a qualified State reinsurance program or a qualifying State high-risk pool by January 1, 2015, funded by State premium assessments. States without a current high-risk pool must establish one to meet the requirement. States must operate a qualified State reinsurance program or a qualifying State high-risk pool by January 1, 2015, funded by State premium assessments.

The State may use premium assessment funds to transition from operating a high-risk pool to a qualified State reinsurance program. If the high-risk pool is financially healthy, it meets the requirements. A qualified State reinsurance program provides reinsurance for health insurance in the small group market.

It must satisfy HIPAA requirements and be deemed a qualified high-risk pool. A qualifying State high-risk pool must offer at least two coverage options, including a high deductible health plan with a health savings account, and be funded stably. The high-risk pool must be funded stably and eliminate waiting lists for eligible residents. It should cover individuals who would be eligible for Medicare after a disability waiting period and limit premiums to 150% of the average standard risk rates.

Verification of citizenship or nationality is required for participation in a qualifying State high-risk pool receiving funds under the Public Health Service Act.
