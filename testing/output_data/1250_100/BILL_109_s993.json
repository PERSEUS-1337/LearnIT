The excise tax of 100 percent applies to acquisition costs of an interest in an applicable insurance contract by exempt organizations or individuals under Section 4965 of the Internal Revenue Code. This includes fees, commissions, charges, or other amounts paid in connection with the acquisition, regardless of the payee. Timing of payments is important, with the tax imposed each time costs are paid or incurred over multiple calendar years. An interest in the contract encompasses any rights related to it, whether as an owner, beneficiary, or otherwise, including indirect interests in entities holding the contract. In the context of applicable insurance contracts, any interest in the contracts involved in an exchange is treated as an interest in all contracts. Increasing an interest in such a contract is considered a separate acquisition. Acquiring an interest before it becomes applicable is taxable once it becomes applicable. Applicable exempt organizations include those described in specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax imposed by this section shall not be included in investment in the contract. Regulations may exempt certain contracts from treatment as insurance contracts based on specific factors and provide appropriate rules for the application of this section. The Secretary may prevent abuse in cases deemed necessary. The tax imposed by this section aims to prevent multiple taxes on the same interest and avoid avoidance of the section's purposes.
