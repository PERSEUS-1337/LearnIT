    "content": "The \"Waterways Are Vital for the Economy, Energy, Efficiency, and Environment Act of 2012\" or the \"WAVE4 Act\" recognizes the importance of the inland waterways navigation system for the nation's economy, energy reliability, efficiency in transportation of bulk commodities, and environmental protection. The \"WAVE4 Act\" aims to improve program and project management for navigation projects on inland waterways, optimize system reliability, minimize project completion delays, and prioritize investments for maximum system-wide benefits and reduced risk. The \"WAVE4 Act\" defines qualifying projects as construction or rehabilitation projects for navigation infrastructure on inland waterways funded by the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Major rehabilitation projects involve restoring features with costs exceeding $100,000,000. Additionally, the Act includes project delivery process reforms. The Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, mandates formal project management training and certification for project managers of qualifying projects. Personnel assigned as project managers must be fully certified. Cost estimation for qualifying projects must be risk-based with a confidence level of at least 80 percent. Independent external peer review is required for qualifying projects with estimated total costs exceeding $45,000,000, public safety concerns, or high complexity. The Chief of Engineers determines projects of significant interagency interest or requested by a Governor. Inland Waterways Users Board members are appointed to project development teams, receive quarterly project updates, and sign project management plans. Lessons learned from past projects are applied to improve on-time and on-budget completion of qualifying projects. The Secretary may evaluate early contractor involvement acquisition procedures to improve project delivery performance. Additional measures may include implementing practices from military construction, creating design centers, using standard designs for locks, full-funding contracts, and establishing procedures for new project construction starts. SEC. 6. 20-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must submit a 20-year program for capital investments on inland waterways to Congress. This program should be based on national project-selection criteria and updated annually with any changes to project-specific recommendations. The Secretary of the Army, with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must review and update the capital investment program for the Inland Marine Transportation System every 5 years, making revisions as needed and submitting a strategic review to Congress. SEC. 7. COST SHARING FOR QUALIFYING PROJECTS. One-half of the construction cost of a qualifying project is funded from the general fund of the Treasury, and the other half from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Dams are an exception, with costs covered only by the general fund. SEC. 8. LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES FROM THE INLAND WATERWAYS TRUST FUND. Section 9506 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to limit expenditures from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund for construction or rehabilitation of dams and any rehabilitation expenditure below $100,000,000. Additionally, the Fund cannot be used to cover costs exceeding the total authorized cost of a Federal project. The Public Law authorizes adjustments for inflation and additional amounts for inland waterways projects as agreed upon by the Secretary and the Inland Waterways Users Board. SEC. 9. REVISION TO INLAND WATERWAYS USER FEE. Amendment to the Inland Waterways Trust Fund financing rate, increasing the tax per gallon to 26 cents after 2012."
