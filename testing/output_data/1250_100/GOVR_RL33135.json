The Global Fund, established in January 2002, includes representatives from donor and recipient governments, NGOs, the private sector, and affected communities. With a small Secretariat in Geneva, the Fund mobilizes resources for disease control through coordinated applications from recipient countries. The Global Fund was established in January 2002 to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. It includes representatives from various sectors and uses coordinated applications from recipient countries to allocate funds. The applications are reviewed by independent experts, and grants are given to Principal Recipients for implementation. The Fund operates in \"Rounds\" to ensure continuous funding for projects. PEPFAR was launched by President George W. Bush in 2003 to support international AIDS projects. The United States initiated bilateral international AIDS projects through USAID in the mid-1980s. The Clinton Administration's LIFE initiative expanded efforts with other agencies like the CDC. PEPFAR, authorized in 2003, consolidated these efforts under a Global AIDS Coordinator. Randall Tobias was appointed to this role. PEPFAR pledged $9 billion over five years for 15 countries and $5 billion for ongoing bilateral AIDS programs. Funding is managed through the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative directed by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator. PEPFAR promised $5 billion over five years for ongoing bilateral AIDS programs in 105 other countries, as well as $1 billion in contributions to the Global Fund. Overall, PEPFAR represented $10 billion in \"new money\" for combating the global AIDS pandemic. The initiative aims to support treatment for 2 million HIV-infected people by 2008, prevent 7 million new HIV infections, and provide care for 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS. As of March 2005, PEPFAR was supporting antiretroviral therapy for over 235,000 AIDS patients in focus countries. In September 2004, 1.7 million people were receiving care, including 630,000 Orphans and Vulnerable Children. Prevention messages reached 120 million people, with 96 million condoms distributed for high-risk behavior programs. The Global Fund had put 220,000 patients on HIV therapy, tested 2.5 million people, and supported 397,000 orphans. Donors pledged $3.7 billion at a conference in London in September 2005. The Global Fund estimated needing $7 billion for existing grants and future applications. At a pledging conference in London in September 2005, donors pledged $3.7 billion to the Global Fund. Without additional pledges, the Fund may only be able to fund existing grants and not bring new resources to fight the AIDS pandemic. The Board approved 26 grants totaling $382 million over two years, with 37 more grants pending additional pledges in 2006. The United States made contributions totaling $275 million from FY2001 and FY2002, with increased requests in subsequent years. The Administration raised its request for Global Fund contributions to $300 billion for FY2006, reflecting Congress's preference for larger contributions. Funding for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund has been primarily through Foreign Operations Appropriations legislation and appropriations for Labor/HHS. In FY2004, $87.8 million of the appropriated amount was not provided due to legislative restrictions. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations legislation directed withheld funds to be provided in FY2005, subject to the 33% contribution limit. The Senate-passed Foreign Operations bill for FY2006 includes $100 million transferred from the Economic Support Fund. The U.S. contribution to the Global Fund is estimated at about 29% for 2005. U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Randall Tobias pledged at least $600 million for 2006 and 2007, with Congress expected to determine the final amount. The $600 million offered represents 16% of total pledges for the two years. The U.S. contribution to the Global Fund is a strategic priority of PEPFAR, with both programs seen as partners in the fight against AIDS. The Global Fund is described as the multilateral arm of PEPFAR, complementing U.S. bilateral programs worldwide. U.S.-Global Fund cooperation is emphasized for increased treatment numbers in the coming years. The U.S. has a significant stake in the Global Fund, with U.S.-Global Fund cooperation highlighted through key leadership roles. The Global Fund complements PEPFAR by mobilizing resources to fight AIDS globally, including within the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative focus countries. The U.S. leverages its investment by contributing to the Global Fund, allowing other donors to also support the fight against the pandemic. The Global Fund complements PEPFAR by mobilizing resources to fight AIDS globally, allowing other donors to participate in the pandemic response. Through cooperation with local institutions, the Global Fund helps build indigenous capacities for long-term health challenges, while PEPFAR provides emergency assistance in heavily affected countries. Both organizations work closely together to address the pandemic at the local level. The Global Fund and USAID cooperate at both local and headquarters levels to provide technical assistance and antiretroviral treatment for AIDS patients. Despite emphasis on partnership, some suspect US officials are not entirely happy with the Global Fund, possibly due to the choice of a non-American Executive Director in 2002. The lead-up to the 2003 war in Iraq influenced the Administration's attitudes towards the Global Fund, leading to requests for less funding than Congress was willing to provide. Despite initial skepticism, there is now a new spirit of cooperation between PEPFAR and the Global Fund, symbolized by a $300 million request in FY2006. However, the level of U.S. contributions remains a point of contention among Fund supporters. The United States is unlikely to increase its contributions to the Global Fund unless it boosts its support. Other donors see the U.S. contribution as a benchmark and believe they should provide two-thirds of the funding while the U.S. provides the rest. The U.S. would need to contribute $2.3 billion in FY2006 and FY2007 combined to persuade other donors to meet the Fund's $7 billion need. Some argue that the U.S. has already been generous and should not be expected to do more. The United States is contributing significantly more than all other donors combined to the Global Fund and is on track to exceed the initially promised $1 billion over five years for PEPFAR. Despite criticism at a meeting in Bankok, the U.S. remains the largest contributor to global pandemic efforts, providing 45.4% of funds committed by G7 nations and the European Communities for international AIDS programs. The United States is a significant contributor to international AIDS programs, providing more funding than all other donors combined to the Global Fund. Despite criticism, the U.S. remains the largest contributor, exceeding the initially promised amount for PEPFAR. The Kaiser study showed that the U.S. ranked third in funding, behind Britain and Canada, but ahead of France, Germany, and Japan. Donors are falling short of the total resources needed to fight AIDS, with the U.S. implementing a one-third rule for contributions as a safeguard. Other donors may not be following this rule for 2006 and 2007 pledges. Supporters of a larger U.S. contribution to the Global Fund argue that it would affirm the country's leadership in the fight against AIDS and have diplomatic benefits. They praise the Fund's innovative and multilateral approach, contrasting it with PEPFAR's more centralized efforts. Many stakeholders support the Global Fund as the primary component of the U.S. response to the pandemic, praising its institution-building contributions in developing countries. They prefer the Global Fund over PEPFAR's bilateral programs due to perceived restrictions and requirements, such as the allocation of funds for abstinence-until-marriage programs. Some question the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage programs and worry about the impact of the prostitution pledge on NGOs working with key HIV populations. Ambassador Tobias rescinded a requirement for NGOs funded through the Global Fund to sign the pledge in 2005. Opponents of increasing U.S. contributions to the Global Fund argue that PEPFAR's bilateral efforts are superior, emphasizing the experience and coordination of U.S. agencies like USAID and CDC. They believe PEPFAR's embassy-based approach allows for better local considerations and capacity building. PEPFAR advocates argue that the program's restrictions reflect U.S. values and helped secure $10 billion in funding. They point to Global Fund program difficulties as a reason for caution in contributing more. In contrast, Global Fund supporters emphasize the effectiveness of their programs despite occasional mismanagement issues in specific countries. The Global Fund's oversight mechanisms are effective and transparent, leading to grant suspensions in cases of mismanagement. Grants to Ukraine and Uganda have been resumed with conditions for improved governance and grant management. Early stages of grant implementation may face challenges, but capacity for grant administration tends to improve over time. Advocates suggest finding a way to support the Global Fund without detracting from bilateral efforts like PEPFAR. The United States has contributed significantly to the Global Fund, with concerns that a failure to mobilize resources for the AIDS pandemic would reflect poorly on U.S. policy. There are doubts about PEPFAR meeting its objectives without supporting the Global Fund. Challenges exist in increasing U.S. contributions to the Global Fund due to finite resources in appropriations bills. Executive branch agencies tend to prioritize bilateral programs over multilateral ones in budget discussions. The Global Fund has strong supporters in Congress, leading to appropriations above the Administration's request but not at the scale needed. Advocates suggest increasing funding for Foreign Operations and/or Labor/HHS to allow for a larger contribution to the Global Fund. Some argue for repealing legislative provisions limiting the U.S. contribution to 33% to avoid future fund withholding. Another option is for the U.S. to persuade other donor countries to contribute more. Some suggest that the United States should persuade other donor countries to increase their contributions to the Global Fund. This could be done by highlighting the U.S.'s efforts in the fight against AIDS through PEPFAR and encouraging other countries to participate by giving more to the Global Fund. It is also proposed that private sector donors, foundations, and the general public should be encouraged to contribute to the Global Fund, as Ambassador Tobias did at a pledging conference in 2005. Some suggest hosting music events similar to Live Aid to raise funds for the Global Fund, as current contributions are relatively low. The Gates Foundation has donated $150 million, while corporations have given $1.9 million and individuals/groups/events have contributed $3.3 million. There is potential for larger contributions from alternative sources to boost Global Fund resources for combating the Global AIDS pandemic."
