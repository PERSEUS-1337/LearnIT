    "content": "The Act titled \"No Funds for Cyber Coordination with Russia Act of 2017\" includes sections on short title, definitions, purpose, findings, funding prohibition, sense of Congress, and termination. The Act defines key terms related to cyber coordination with Russia. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"Cybersecurity\" is defined as protecting cyberspace from cyberattacks, and a \"cybersecurity unit\" is any organization focused on cybersecurity. Cyberspace is the global domain of interconnected information systems, including the Internet and telecommunications networks. Significant activities undermining cybersecurity involve efforts to disrupt or steal information without authorization for influence operations. Significant activities undermining cybersecurity include unauthorized access to information for influence operations, misappropriation of funds or resources, destructive malware attacks, and denial of service activities. The purpose of this Act is to protect United States cybersecurity and critical infrastructure by preventing the President from establishing a cybersecurity unit with the Government of the Russian Federation, a known foreign adversary. Congress finds that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election were ordered by President Vladimir Putin to undermine public faith in the democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and support President-elect Trump. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13757 on December 29, 2016, amending Executive Order 13694 to address malicious cyber-enabled activities. The new order allows for sanctions against individuals and entities involved in tampering with election processes or institutions. The Russian Federation has launched cyber-attacks against US agencies, including the Department of State, Department of Defense, and the White House. In 2017, Russian FSB officers were charged for hacking Yahoo and US citizens' email accounts. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated that Russia's influence activities in the 2016 election were unprecedented. Former FBI Director James Comey testified that the Russian government used various methods to influence American thinking, voting, and actions. President Trump expressed concern about Russia's attempts to undermine America's credibility and democratic system. President Trump strongly confronted President Putin about Russian election meddling, with Putin vehemently denying it. They discussed forming a Cyber Security unit to prevent hacking and negative activities, aiming to move forward in constructive cooperation with Russia. SEC. 5. FUNDING PROHIBITION.\n\nNo Federal funds may be used to establish a cybersecurity unit with the Government of the Russian Federation.\n\nSEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\nIt is the sense of Congress that the President should endorse the assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, not engage in cyber coordination with Russia, and establish a commission to investigate Russian cyber operations.\n\nSEC. 7. TERMINATION. SEC. 7. TERMINATION.\n\nThe Act's prohibitions end when the President certifies that Russia has stopped undermining democracies worldwide and acknowledges interference in the 2016 US election."
