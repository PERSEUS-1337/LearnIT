The District's appropriations act is now included in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. District appropriations typically include special federal payments for specific initiatives, the operating budget for day-to-day functions, and funds for long-term capital outlays. The District's operating budget expenditures are funded by local taxes, federal funds, and fees. General provisions in the budget cover fiscal directives, administrative controls, and restrictions on lobbying and social policy. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included $677.8 million in federal payments to the District, with a focus on courts and criminal justice. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included $677.8 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a focus on courts and criminal justice. This funding covered various aspects such as court operations, Defender Services, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the public defender's office, and costs associated with investigating judicial misconduct complaints. Additionally, the budget allocated funds for education initiatives, including support for elementary and secondary education, the D.C. National Guard college access program, and college tuition assistance. In 2012, the District of Columbia Council approved an FY2013 budget of $11.4 billion in operating funds and $1.1 billion in capital outlays. The mayor signed the measure on June 15, 2012, which included a provision for budget autonomy in the absence of a federal appropriations act. This provision was supported by the Administration and included in various bills considered during the 112th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3301, its version of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2013, recommending $676.2 million in special federal payments to the District. This was $10.6 million more than FY2012, with increased funding for court operations but less for elementary and secondary education initiatives. The bill allocated funds for public school improvements, support for public charter schools, and a private school voucher program, which was not included in the Administration's budget request. The Senate bill, S. 3301, included provisions for a school voucher program and restrictions on the use of federal funds to support District statehood or voting representation. It also included changes sought by city officials. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2013, H.R. 6020, with $673.7 million in special federal payments to the District. This included changes in provisions sought by city officials, such as lifting the prohibition on District funds for abortion services but maintaining restrictions on federal funds for certain programs. The House bill for the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2013 included $60 million in funding for education in the District of Columbia, with allocations for public schools, charter schools, and private school vouchers. It also included provisions for budgetary controls and required the Chief Financial Officer to submit a revised operating budget within 30 days. Additionally, the bill addressed statehood and congressional representation issues for the District. H.R. 6020 would have provided funding for the office of Statehood Representative and Statehood Senator in the District of Columbia, while prohibiting the use of District and federal funds for abortion services. It also continued to restrict federal funds for needle exchange programs and the medical use of marijuana. Despite this, the city certified four medical marijuana dispensaries in 2012, with the first one opening in June 2013. The Obama Administration urged the House to allow the District to use its own funds if Congress failed to approve the District budget before the fiscal year. The statement objected to provisions in the budget that restricted federal funds for the District's needle exchange program and abortion services, citing conflicts with current law and home rule principles. Congress passed a continuing resolution (P.L.112-175) to fund federal programs at 0.612% above FY2012 levels until March 27, 2013, allowing the District to spend locally-raised funds as outlined in the Budget Request Act of 2012. The District of Columbia Budget Request Act of 2012 appropriated $24.7 million in special federal payments for emergency planning and security costs, including $9.8 million for expenses related to the Presidential Inauguration.

The District's FY2013 General Fund Budget totaled $11.4 billion, with $9.4 billion for operating expenses and $1.9 billion for enterprise funds. Of the $11.4 billion budgeted for operating expenses, $998.2 million was projected to be derived from federal grants and $1.672 billion from Medicaid payments. The controversy surrounding funding a needle exchange program in the District for FY2013 touches on issues of home rule, public health policy, and government sanctioning of illegal drugs. Proponents argue that such programs reduce HIV spread among drug users, while opponents believe it sanctions drug use. Another view focuses on the city's ability to use local funds for such programs free from congressional restrictions. The District of Columbia faced restrictions on using federal and local funds for needle exchange programs, with limitations set by Congress in various Appropriations Acts. The prohibition on using funds for needle exchange was eventually lifted in the FY2002 Act, allowing private funding for such programs. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act lifted the prohibition on using District funds for needle exchange programs. The FY2004 bill allowed the use of private funds for needle exchange programs and required tracking of funds separately. The FY2008 Appropriations Act modified the needle exchange provision from previous acts. The FY2008 Appropriations Act modified the needle exchange provision to allow the use of District funds for a program aimed at reducing HIV/AIDS spread among drug users.

P.L. 113-6 maintained the ban on federal funds for needle exchange programs in the District. The city's medical marijuana initiative faced controversy, with a provision in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 prohibiting the counting of ballots for a voter-approved initiative for medical marijuana use. Congress's power to block the initiative was challenged in court, with a ruling that Congress did not have the authority to stifle political speech. The ruling allowed the city to tally the votes from the November 1998 ballot initiative on medical marijuana. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent the initiative's implementation. Language prohibiting the initiative's implementation was included in the District of Columbia Appropriations Acts for FY2000 and FY2002. Opponents argued that such actions undermined home rule. Legal challenges were made to Congress's power to block the initiative's implementation, with groups seeking injunctive relief to put another medical marijuana initiative on the ballot. The District's Board of Elections and Ethics faced obstacles in putting a medical marijuana initiative on the November 2002 ballot due to a congressional ban on using public funds for such purposes. A U.S. district court judge later deemed this ban unconstitutional, but the decision was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the authority to regulate interstate drug marketing. The District of Columbia has legislation regulating the medical use of marijuana, with dispensaries set to open in 2012.

Congress has placed limitations on the use of public funds for abortion services for District residents since 1979. The District of Columbia has faced restrictions on public funding for abortion services since 1979. In 1989, President Reagan and later President George H. W. Bush imposed limitations on the use of District and federal funds for abortion services, only allowing them in cases where the woman's life was endangered. The District successfully lobbied for the removal of these restrictions in the FY1994 appropriations act, reinstating public funding for abortion services in cases of rape and incest. The District of Columbia faced restrictions on public funding for abortion services since 1979. In FY2010, Congress lifted the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services, but maintained restrictions on federal funds. However, the position was reversed in FY2011 and FY2012 appropriations acts, limiting the use of both federal and District funds for abortion services.

In FY2010, Congress lifted the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services, but maintained restrictions on federal funds. However, in FY2011 and FY2012 appropriations acts, limitations were placed on both federal and District funds for abortion services. The Senate bill, S. 3301, supported the Administration's position on restricting federal funds for abortion services, while the House bill, H.R. 6020, included language that would restrict both federal and District funds for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the woman's life. P.L. 113-6 allows the District to use its own funds for abortion services only in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the pregnant woman is at risk. During the 112th Congress, bills were introduced in the House to ban or restrict abortion services in the District of Columbia. The House Judiciary Committee ordered reported H.R. 3803, the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act on June 17, 2012. The bill aimed to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, except in cases of physical danger to the woman. It would have imposed penalties on doctors performing abortions after the 20th week and allowed civil actions against them. Physicians would have been required to report specific information on abortions to the District health agency. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, P.L. 108-199, authorized funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program, a school voucher program for the District of Columbia. It also provided funding for DC Public Schools, public charter schools, and vouchers, known as the \"three-prong approach\" to supporting education in DC. The program was reauthorized through the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act. The Opportunity Scholarship program in DC was reauthorized through the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act, with appropriations authorized for FY2012 through FY2016 at $60 million each year. The program's funding is divided evenly among DCPS, public charter schools, and the Opportunity Scholarship program. The Obama Administration's proposed budget for FY2013 did not include funds for the Opportunity Scholarship program. S. 3301 proposed $53.5 million for school improvement, with $20 million each allocated for DCPS and public charter schools. The funding allocation for education in DC included $20 million for DCPS, $20 million for public charter schools, and $13.5 million for the Opportunity Scholarship program. H.R. 6020 distributed $59.8 million evenly among the three initiatives."
