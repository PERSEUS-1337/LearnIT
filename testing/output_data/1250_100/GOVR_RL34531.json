    "content": "The United States is involved in Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) which govern the rights and privileges of U.S. military personnel in foreign countries. These agreements determine criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel, with some allowing shared jurisdiction with the host country. SOFAs do not cover mutual defense or security agreements, specific exercises, or wartime laws. They also do not affect the parties' right of self-defense under the law of war. The United States is party to over 100 Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) that govern the rights of U.S. military personnel in foreign countries. SOFAs are specific to individual countries and can be amended or canceled. The Department of State and Department of Defense negotiate the terms of these agreements, with the NATO SOFA being the only one concluded as part of a treaty. The NATO SOFA was ratified on March 19, 1970, with reservations stating the US's right to exclude or remove individuals deemed a security threat. Senate reservations include conditions on criminal jurisdiction and procedural safeguards for US servicemembers tried in receiving states. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement among NATO member countries, with 26 countries having ratified or acceded to it. Another 24 countries are subject to the NATO SOFA through the NATO Partnership for Peace program, which aims to increase stability and security relationships. The United States has common SOFA agreements with approximately 58 countries through NATO. The United States has agreements in over 115 countries worldwide, with NATO SOFA and NATO PfP SOFA accounting for half of them. Department of Defense Directive 5525.1 outlines policies to protect U.S. personnel subject to foreign trials and imprisonment. Reservations to NATO SOFA apply to future SOFAs, ensuring similar safeguards for U.S. personnel abroad. SOFAs cover various topics like jurisdiction, uniforms, taxes, weapons, radio frequencies, licenses, and customs regulations. There are no formal requirements for SOFA content or length. The United States has SOFAs with over 115 countries, with NATO agreements accounting for half. SOFAs cover topics like jurisdiction, uniforms, taxes, weapons, radio frequencies, licenses, and customs regulations. Agreements can range from one page to over 200 pages, addressing legal protection for U.S. personnel in foreign countries. The United States has agreements with over 115 countries known as SOFAs, which cover various topics including jurisdiction. These agreements determine whether the U.S. or the host country has criminal and civil jurisdiction over U.S. personnel in foreign countries. Jurisdiction can be exclusive or shared, allowing the U.S. to request jurisdiction in certain cases. This jurisdiction applies even when individuals are off military installations, providing immunity from foreign laws. The United States has agreements with over 115 countries known as SOFAs, which cover jurisdiction. These agreements determine whether the U.S. or the host country has jurisdiction over U.S. personnel. The U.S. can request jurisdiction in certain cases, providing immunity from foreign laws. The agreement with Mongolia allows U.S. military authorities to exercise criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction over U.S. personnel in Mongolia. Mongolia can request the U.S. to waive jurisdiction in cases of alleged criminal behavior unrelated to official duty. NATO SOFA is an example of shared jurisdiction among member countries. The NATO SOFA allows for shared jurisdiction among member countries. Article VII outlines the jurisdictional framework, where a country can request another to waive its right to jurisdiction. Exclusive jurisdiction is granted in specific circumstances, with concurrent jurisdiction used when offenses violate the laws of both countries. The United States has entered various SOFAs with basic rules for determining jurisdiction. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations establishes classes of personnel with varying legal protections. SOFAs treat U.S. personnel as administrative and technical staff, granting immunity from criminal jurisdiction in the receiving country. While SOFAs do not authorize military operations, the right of self-defense is always preserved. Language in the SOFA defines the agreement's scope, such as in the SOFA with Belize applying to personnel involved in military exercises and training. The SOFA with Belize grants legal protections to U.S. personnel involved in military activities and training, including immunity from criminal jurisdiction. It addresses administrative and operational matters such as wearing uniforms, carrying weapons, and customs regulations. This agreement does not authorize specific operations but provides the legal framework for U.S. personnel in Belize. The United States has concluded agreements with foreign nations related to security commitments and assurances, including SOFAs which are often part of comprehensive security arrangements. These agreements may include collective defense agreements, consultation requirements, legal rights to military intervention, and other non-binding arrangements. The United States has entered into security agreements with various countries, including SOFAs as part of comprehensive security arrangements. After the 9/11 attacks, the US initiated Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, leading to the ousting of the Taliban regime and the signing of security agreements with the new Afghan government in 2002. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the provision of defense articles, services, and training to friendly countries like Afghanistan through the IMET program. It aims to promote foreign policy, security, and economic development while assisting in international peace and security efforts. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes the President to provide military assistance to friendly countries or international organizations to strengthen U.S. security and promote world peace. This includes defense articles, services, and noncombatant personnel, with personnel in Afghanistan having a status equivalent to U.S. Embassy staff under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. The U.Sa. Embassy technical staff in Afghanistan are immune from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. The agreement allows the U.S. government to exercise criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel, and Afghanistan cannot surrender them without U.S. consent. The agreement remains in force under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, but does not provide immunity for contract personnel. Military operations in Afghanistan are ongoing, authorized by Congress. Congress authorized military force in Afghanistan in 2001 to target those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The UN Security Council approved the deployment of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to Afghanistan. ISAF works closely with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), the US-led coalition conducting military operations in Afghanistan. OEF operates with implicit recognition and support from the UN Security Council. In 2004, the United States and Afghanistan entered an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) to provide logistic support to foreign militaries. The Secretary of Defense can enter into an ACSA with NATO countries, the United Nations, or other international organizations for national security interests. President Hamid Karzai and President Bush issued a \"joint declaration\" in 2005 outlining a future agreement between the US and Afghanistan, involving US military support for Afghan security forces. The declaration does not mention the status of US forces in Afghanistan, but a status of forces agreement is expected if an agreement is concluded. In 2008, President Karzai called for a review of foreign forces in Afghanistan after civilian casualties from US airstrikes. The Obama Administration committed to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan, planning to transfer security responsibility to the Afghan government by 2014. Representative Lynn Woolsey introduced a bill requiring the negotiation of a Status of Forces Agreement with Afghanistan. The agreement with Afghanistan must state that U.S. forces are temporary, with all troops withdrawing within one year. Prior agreements with Germany and Japan also outlined defense assistance and operational details. In 1952, the United States and Japan signed a security treaty and administrative agreement, which included provisions on jurisdiction over offenses committed by U.S. forces in Japan. In 1957, a U.S. Army member was indicted for the death of a Japanese civilian, with the U.S. initially claiming jurisdiction but later agreeing to hand over the member to Japanese authorities. In Wilson v. Girard, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed jurisdictional provisions in an administrative agreement related to a writ of habeas corpus for a U.S. Army member indicted for the death of a Japanese civilian. The Court determined that Japan had ceded jurisdiction to the U.S. for trying American military personnel, with conditions for waiver of jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court addressed jurisdictional provisions in an administrative agreement related to a writ of habeas corpus for a U.S. Army member indicted for the death of a Japanese civilian. The Court concluded that the Constitution or legislation did not prohibit carrying out the jurisdictional provisions, leaving the determination of the arrangement to the Executive and Legislative Branches. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, concluded in 1960 and amended in 1990, grants the U.S. the use of facilities in Japan for security purposes. A separate agreement, known as a SOFA, was concluded in 1960 to govern the use of facilities and the status of U.S. Armed Forces. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America and Japan, concluded in 1960 and amended in 1990, grants the U.S. the use of facilities in Japan for security purposes. A separate agreement, known as a SOFA, was also concluded in 1960 to govern the use of facilities and the status of U.S. Armed Forces in Japan. The SOFA has been modified at least four times since its original agreement. In 1954, the United States and the Republic of Korea entered into a mutual defense treaty, granting the U.S. the right to dispose forces in South Korea. This led to the signing of a SOFA between the countries in 1966, which was later amended in 2001. The court ruled in favor of the servicemember, stating that the U.S. did not have authority to release him to Korea for trial. The SOFA diminished Korea's role in enforcing its laws, and the U.S. did not waive jurisdiction over offenses committed on its territory. Senate approval was deemed unnecessary as it would not affect Korea's grant of jurisdiction. The servicemember argued that the Constitution and UCMJ provide the only methods for trying servicemen abroad, which the court agreed with. The court ruled that the U.S. cannot release a servicemember to Korea for trial if there has been a violation of the foreign jurisdiction's criminal laws. The primary jurisdiction lies with the nation where the crime was committed, and the UCMJ only applies if the foreign nation waives its jurisdiction. In 1947, the U.S. and the Philippines entered into an agreement for military assistance, which was extended and amended in 1953. A mutual defense treaty was also signed in 1951 between the two countries. The United States and the Philippines entered into a mutual defense treaty in 1951 to defend against external armed attacks. In 1993, they also signed a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) which was later extended multiple times. Additionally, agreements were made in 1998 and 2006 regarding the treatment of U.S. Armed Forces visiting the Philippines and Republic of Philippines personnel visiting the United States. The United States and the Philippines have agreements regarding the treatment of personnel in each other's countries. The agreement with the Philippines allows U.S. authorities to request jurisdiction over offenses committed by Philippine personnel in the U.S., but the U.S. retains the right to exercise jurisdiction if needed. The United States and Iraq signed a Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship, aiming to replace the UN mandate for security in Iraq. The agreement included plans for political, cultural, economic, and security cooperation, including training and equipping Iraqi forces. The security agreement aimed to support the Iraqi government in training, equipping, and arming the Iraqi Security Forces to provide stability and fight terrorism. It also included security assurances to deter external aggression. Congressional interest was sparked due to concerns about the agreement not being submitted for approval. Multiple hearings were held in the 110th Congress regarding the proposed security agreement. In October 2008, Congress passed the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, requiring a report on any completed U.S.-Iraq agreement. On November 17, 2008, the Strategic Framework Agreement and the Agreement on the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces were signed by U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Iraq Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari. The Strategic Framework Agreement and the Agreement on the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces from Iraq differ from the long-term security arrangement originally planned. The agreements require the withdrawal of U.S. forces by December 31, 2011. The Strategic Framework Agreement is a nonlegal, political agreement focusing on cooperation in various fields. The Security Agreement outlines defense and security cooperation between the United States and Iraq. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq outlines the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government, with provisions for the withdrawal of all forces by December 31, 2011. It includes rules on civil and criminal jurisdiction, weapons, uniforms, entry and exit procedures, taxes, customs, and claims. The Agreement is legally binding and can be terminated within three years by either Party. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq includes provisions for combat operations by U.S. forces, requiring approval and coordination with Iraqi authorities. It allows for arrests or detentions during operations and strategic deliberations in case of threats. The agreements entered into force on January 1, 2009, without Senate approval as a treaty. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq allows for combat operations by U.S. forces, including arrests and strategic deliberations. There is debate on whether congressional authorization is needed for the agreement to be legally binding under U.S. law, given that Congress has already authorized military operations in Iraq. The last major combat unit was withdrawn from Iraq on August 31, 2010. The U.S. Army's 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division allowed Iraq to take over combat operations. Operation New Dawn focused on advising and training Iraqi Security Forces. By December 18, 2011, U.S. forces completed their withdrawal from Iraq, transferring security responsibility to the Iraqi government. The NATO SOFA is a multilateral agreement applicable to NATO member countries. The NATO Partnership for Peace program involves 24 non-NATO countries adhering to the NATO SOFA for increased stability and security. The United States has SOFAs with Japan, Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, established under ratified treaties between the countries. The United States has SOFAs with Australia and the Philippines, established under ratified treaties. These agreements cite general obligations under previously concluded treaties, while agreements with Japan and Korea cite specific authorities. Additionally, the US has military assistance agreements with Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras, expanding on status protections through later SOFAs. The United States has established SOFAs with various countries, including the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, Korea, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. These agreements provide status protections for U.S. personnel in leased locations or through military assistance agreements. The United States has entered into Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) with various countries to support specific activities or exercises. These agreements are sole executive agreements, not based on treaties or congressional action. For example, the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) introduced by the Clinton Administration in 1997 led to SOFAs with many African countries, limiting the agreements to U.S. personnel temporarily in the country for ACRI activities or other agreed-upon activities. The SOFA remains in force even without the ACRI. SOFAs are agreements entered as sole executive agreements with broad language of applicability. They may apply to U.S. personnel \"present\" or \"temporarily present\" in a country, with activities ranging from \"official duties\" to specific classes like humanitarian, exercises, and training."
