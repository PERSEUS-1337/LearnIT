The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a child tax credit equal to $500 multiplied by the number of qualifying children, plus $3,000 multiplied by the number of applicable individuals for whom the taxpayer is an eligible caregiver. Additional credit is given to taxpayers with 3 or more qualifying children or applicable individuals. The caregiver tax credit is increased for taxpayers with 3 or more qualifying children or applicable individuals. Amendments are made to section headings in the Internal Revenue Code. The caregiver tax credit is increased for taxpayers with 3 or more qualifying children or applicable individuals. Section 24 regarding the Family Care Credit is amended in the Internal Revenue Code. Sec. 24 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to define a \"qualifying child\" as an individual under 17 years old who the taxpayer can claim a deduction for and has a specified relationship to the taxpayer. The term \"applicable individual\" is defined as someone certified by a physician as needing long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days within a taxable year. An \"applicable individual\" must be certified by a physician as needing long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days within a taxable year. Unless a physician certifies that an individual meets certain requirements within a specified period, they will not qualify for long-term care benefits. Individuals with long-term care needs must be at least 6 years old and unable to perform certain activities of daily living without assistance or supervision to protect their health and safety. The individual must meet specific criteria to qualify for long-term care benefits, including being unable to perform certain activities of daily living without assistance. This includes individuals aged 2-6 who have a loss of functional capacity in eating, transferring, or mobility, and those under 2 who require durable medical equipment due to a severe health condition. An eligible caregiver must be available for individuals with specific conditions, as outlined in the tax code. This includes the taxpayer, their spouse, and dependents for whom they can claim a deduction. An individual may qualify for additional standard deductions under specific clauses if they meet certain requirements, including the residency test of having their principal place of abode at the taxpayer's home. An individual may qualify for additional standard deductions under specific clauses if they meet certain requirements, including being a member of the taxpayer's household for over half the taxable year or the entire taxable year if they are not an ancestor, descendant, or spouse of the taxpayer. If more than one person is an eligible caregiver for the same individual, the taxpayer can claim the deduction if each caregiver files a declaration stating they will not claim the individual. The section outlines rules for determining the eligible caregiver for tax credit claims, based on modified adjusted gross income. If multiple caregivers are eligible, the one with the highest income is chosen. For married individuals filing separately, the caregiver determination follows the same rules. Identification requirements are specified in the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to require taxpayers to include the name, taxpayer identification number, and physician identification number of applicable individuals on their tax return to claim a credit. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
