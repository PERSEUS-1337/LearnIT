    "content": "Credit for payments or contributions to certain cooperative research organizations. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures. Qualified cooperative research expenditures are defined as contributions to research consortia for qualified research. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified contributions to research consortia for qualified research, subject to limitations on private source funding. The organization's gross receipts for the preceding taxable year determine the qualified contributions ratio, with limitations on certain types of contributions not being taken into account. Contributions exceeding 25% of salary and benefits allocated to services performed by taxpayer's employees are considered overhead. Contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium exceeding one-third of the consortium's total nongovernmental support may be eligible. If a consortium has fewer than 5 participants, contributions are reduced by 20%. The term 'qualified cooperative research consortium' refers to an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, with specific criteria regarding contributors and their contributions. The text chunk discusses rules for nongovernmental contributions to qualified cooperative research consortiums, including limitations on contributors and special rules for noncash contributions and overhead costs. The taxpayer's employees must include overhead properly allocable to services. Amounts for qualified cooperative research expenditures cannot be used again under another subsection. Prepaid contributions to research consortia for future research are treated as paid during the research period. Each consortium must report certification, funding ratio, and other required information to the Secretary and contributors. Each consortium must provide a report to each contributor. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
