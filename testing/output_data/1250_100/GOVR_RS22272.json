    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds for such activities. The FEC regulations exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation, leading to a lawsuit by BCRA sponsors Shays and Meehan. The U.S. District Court agreed with the sponsors in Shays v. FEC, overturning the FEC's initial regulations on political communications on the Internet. The court found that the FEC's definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's use of the phrase \"general public political advertising\" in the BCRA. It upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a public communication but criticized the FEC for not providing adequate notice in its 2002 NPRM. The court left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" on the Internet. The Shays court found that FEC's rule exempting Internet communications from \"public communications\" definition meant they couldn't be considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation. Court remanded the case to FEC for action consistent with its decision. FEC published NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements. The FEC requested comments on proposed rules to include paid Internet advertisements in the definition of \"public communication,\" along with seeking feedback on related definitions and regulations. After a public hearing in June 2005, the FEC delayed consideration of Internet regulations pending congressional action. In March 2006, the FEC unanimously approved new regulations in response to the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision. The FEC proposed rules to include paid Internet advertisements in the definition of \"public communication,\" while seeking to exclude all other Internet communications from regulation. The Commission aimed to uphold the importance of preventing corruption while recognizing the unique role of the Internet in promoting free speech and information exchange. The FEC regulations include the regulation of paid Internet ads as \"public communications,\" requiring disclaimers on political committee websites for ads advocating for or against federal candidates and soliciting contributions. The regulations apply when money is exchanged for Internet campaign ads, subjecting them to FECA limitations, source restrictions, and reporting requirements. The FEC regulations require disclaimers on political committee websites for ads advocating for or against federal candidates and soliciting contributions. Disclaimers are not needed on e-mails unless sent by political committees. Payments to bloggers from candidates must be disclosed on candidate statements. Coordinated internet ads placed on another website for a fee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA regulations. The media exemption applies to news stories and editorials distributed through broadcasters, newspapers, and periodicals. During Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002, the subject of communications over the Internet was not addressed, but it was discussed during debate on a previous version of what became BCRA during House consideration of H.R. 417 (Shays-Meehan) in the 106th Congress. An amendment to exempt communications over the Internet from regulation under FECA was defeated. Several bills in the 109th Congress proposed to exempt all Internet communications from regulation under FECA. During the 109th Congress, proposals were made to address concerns about the Online Freedom of Speech Act potentially allowing FECA circumvention. Bills such as H.R. 4194 and H.R. 4900 aimed to regulate Internet communications and advertisements, but House floor action was postponed indefinitely after new FEC regulations were approved in March 2006. During the 110th Congress, there was no major legislative action on regulating political communications on the Internet. H.R. 894 and H.R. 5699 were introduced, with the former extending disclaimer requirements to Internet communications and the latter exempting certain Internet services from being considered contributions or expenditures. H.R. 5699 also aimed to exempt blogs and electronic publications from expenditure regulations. No similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress regarding the general media exemption for broadcast stations and newspapers."
