    "content": "United Nations reform is a key policy issue for the United States, with Congress responsible for appropriating funds and imposing conditions on payments. Reform efforts have been cyclical, focusing on inefficiencies, duplication, and fraud within the organization. United Nations reform efforts have evolved over time, reflecting political, economic, and cultural climates. In the 1950s and 1960s, focus was on increasing membership on key councils. In the 1970s, structural changes were considered to address economic disparities. Reforms in the 1980s and 1990s targeted financial and structural issues, influenced by the United States. Since the early 2000s, reform has been driven by budgetary challenges, mismanagement controversies, and allegations of abuse. The report examines U.N. reform priorities from various perspectives, including Members of Congress, the Obama Administration, member states, and the U.N. Secretary-General. It discusses congressional actions, mechanisms for implementing reform, and challenges facing U.S. policymakers. U.N. reform efforts gained momentum in 2005 with the World Summit Outcome Document, leading to reforms in U.N. management structures, the Security Council, U.N. system coordination, and the creation of a new Human Rights Council. Member states have worked towards implementing these reforms with varying success. The report discusses U.N. reform efforts and the varying success of implementing reforms. Congress supports the U.N. mission but can be critical and use legislative tools to influence U.S. policy at the U.N., such as placing financial conditions on funding. Congress has used financial conditions to influence U.N. policy, withholding funds for programs it disapproves of, such as those related to the Palestine Liberation Organization. This includes withholding funding from UNESCO since 2012 due to the admission of \"Palestine\" as a member. The share of assessed payments for U.N. programs depends on the funding source. If funded by the U.N. regular budget and the U.S. withholds contributions, the program may be covered by surplus funds. Some programs are funded from multiple budgets, making U.S. withholdings less impactful. However, if the U.S. withholds funds from programs primarily funded by member states, the impact could be greater. Congress can also enact legislation to adjust U.S. assessment levels or link payments to favored policies. In October 1993, Congress capped U.S. payments for peacekeeping assessments at 25%, lower than the UN's level. Legislation like the Helms-Biden Agreement tied U.S. assessment levels and arrears payment to reform benchmarks. Some lawmakers propose shifting U.S. funding from assessed to voluntary contributions, but opponents fear it may weaken U.S. influence at the UN and impact diplomatic relations. Critics argue that withholding U.S. funds could breach treaty obligations and isolate other UN member states. Unrealistic U.N. reform proposals are also a concern. Advocates of linking U.S. funding to specific U.N. reforms believe it can push for comprehensive reform, citing past successful legislation like the Kassebaum-Solomon amendment. They argue that tying funding to reform may motivate countries to find common ground on divisive issues and lead to substantive changes in U.N. operations. Congress's influence over funding is seen as a powerful tool for furthering U.S. reform policy at the United Nations. Some strategies for Congress to advocate U.N. reform include proposing resolutions, working with the U.N. Secretary-General, and collaborating with other member states. These approaches have been used by past and current Members of Congress to further U.S. reform policy interests. The United States may collaborate with other U.N. member states to build consensus on reform policies, focusing on key priorities and compromising on lesser issues. The 114th Congress should monitor ongoing reform initiatives and consider future proposals for U.N. reform. The United States generally supports the mission and mandate of the United Nations, playing a key role in its establishment in 1945. Some Administrations have advocated for reform of the organization, with President Obama's Administration focusing on \"re-engaging\" with the UN through various initiatives such as elevating the status of the U.S. Permanent Representative to a Cabinet-level position and addressing budget processes and transparency issues. The Obama Administration has implemented initiatives to improve transparency and accountability within the United Nations, including freezing staff salaries, reforming human resources practices, and overhauling business practices. Additionally, they have supported the U.N. Transparency and Accountability Initiative and worked on evaluating and improving the U.N. system. In September 2010, the IO Bureau hired an advisor to review the effectiveness of international organizations, including U.N. entities. The Administration has resisted legislation tying U.S. contributions to specific U.N. reforms. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized U.N. reform efforts, focusing on management, budget, oversight, and fiscal discipline. The Bush Administration prioritized U.N. reform efforts, focusing on management, oversight, and fiscal discipline. However, some reform initiatives were not approved by the General Assembly, leading to dissatisfaction with the pace and effectiveness of reform efforts. Finding common ground on U.N. reform is challenging due to disparate definitions held by stakeholders, resulting in debates over past and current initiatives. Identifying policy priorities in the reform debate can help determine stakeholder perspectives. Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. Secretary-General, has made U.N. reform a top priority during his tenure. His efforts include restructuring departments, establishing a \"Change Management Team,\" and proposing staff mobility improvements. However, the effectiveness of his reforms is still uncertain, with some experts criticizing his lack of comprehensive reform pressure on member states. Ban Ki-moon's reform efforts as U.N. Secretary-General are limited by member states' authority, with concerns that his initiatives may undermine their power. Developed countries, major contributors to the U.N. budget, prioritize peacekeeping and efficiency, while developing countries, represented by the Group of 77, have differing views on reform. Developed countries prioritize peacekeeping and efficiency at the U.N., seeking greater flexibility for the Secretary-General in implementing reforms related to oversight and human resources. They emphasize the effective use of their larger financial contributions. In contrast, developing countries, represented by the Group of 77, focus on development-oriented policies and are wary of reforms that may shift power away from the General Assembly. This difference in reform philosophy has led to deadlocks in decision-making processes. The difference in reform philosophy between developed and developing countries has caused deadlocks in the General Assembly, delaying management and budget reforms. In December 2005, developed countries led by the United States and Japan tried to link the U.N. budget to management reforms, imposing a spending cap of $950 million. The General Assembly's Fifth Committee voted on a resolution in May 2006, approving some reforms but delaying others, disappointing the developed nations. The budget cap was eventually lifted in June 2006 to avoid a shutdown of the United Nations. Since 1945, various groups have been formed to improve the United Nations, including the Volcker Commission, U.S. Institute of Peace U.N. Reform Task Force, and Kofi Annan's 2005 report. They all recommended enhanced internal oversight, Secretariat reform, staff buyouts, financial disclosure requirements, and streamlining of the U.N. system. In April 2004, an independent high-level commission led by Paul Volcker was appointed to investigate corruption in the U.N.-led Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. The commission recommended fundamental administrative reform in the United Nations, including the establishment of an Independent Oversight Board, a Chief Operating Officer position, fair compensation for third parties, and expanded financial disclosure requirements for U.N. staff. Congress later directed the U.S. Institute of Peace to create a bipartisan task force to examine ways to improve the United Nations. The bipartisan task force, funded by Congress with $1.5 million, recommended key reforms for the United Nations to address security and human rights challenges. These reforms included creating an independent oversight board, establishing a Chief Operating Officer position, setting up a U.N. Ethics Office, enhancing whistle-blower protection, and implementing results-based budgeting. The task force also proposed the creation of a new U.N. Human Rights Council to replace the Commission on Human Rights. On March 21, 2005, Secretary-General Annan released his report, In Larger Freedom, in response to the High-Level Panel's findings. The report proposed various management reforms, including reviewing U.N. mandates, implementing a staff-buyout, establishing a Cabinet-style decision-making body, and enhancing the Office of Internal Oversight Services. Annan also suggested institutional and programmatic changes, such as modifying the U.N. Security Council's composition and replacing the Commission on Human Rights with a new Human Rights Council. Annan recommended streamlining the General Assembly agenda and committee structure for faster decision-making. U.N. reform initiatives involve organizational changes through Charter amendments or non-Charter reforms. Charter amendments require approval by two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratification by two-thirds of member states. The Charter was last amended in 1973 to increase ECOSOC membership. The U.N. Charter, last amended in 1973, allows for possible reform initiatives such as increasing Security Council and ECOSOC membership. A General Conference can be convened to review the Charter, with revisions requiring a two-thirds vote and ratification by two-thirds of member states. Despite reforms to its processes, a Charter review conference has never been held. The General Assembly and the Secretary-General have implemented various reforms within the United Nations, including restructuring departments and establishing new bodies like the Peacebuilding Commission. Achieving comprehensive U.N. reform remains a significant challenge for member states. The 114th Congress should consider possible obstacles to reform when drafting legislation. Some U.N. member states use reform proposals to advance their own policy goals, causing distrust among countries. The inability to prioritize reform initiatives and reach consensus can lead to delays or failures in reform efforts. Secretary-General Annan proposed reforms in 2005 to be adopted as a package, but some argue for a more selective approach by member states. Some argue for a selective approach to UN reform, prioritizing certain initiatives for adoption and implementation. Concerns exist about a \"culture of inaction\" within the UN, with resistance to new programs and changes. Lack of clear implementation plans and follow-up could hinder the success of reforms. Without proper implementation plans and follow-up, U.N. member states may struggle to assess the effectiveness of reforms. Challenges include the limited U.N. budget for reform initiatives and complex relationships among member states outside the U.N. system. Factors like military conflict, religious differences, and geography can impact reform priorities and cooperation among member states. Selected Reform Legislation: Congress may wish to explore past legislative approaches like the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment and the Helms-Biden Agreement, which may have influenced U.N. reform measures. The Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment in 1986 required a reduction in the U.S. assessed contribution to the U.N. regular budget unless major contributors had a greater say in the budget process. This legislation led to changes in U.N. policies. In 1993, concerns about oversight and accountability within the U.N. system led Congress to withhold 10% of U.S. assessed contributions until the establishment of an independent oversight office. The U.N. General Assembly then established the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in 1994, providing auditing, investigation, and consulting services. The Helms-Biden Agreement of 1999 authorized payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations based on specific reform benchmarks. The U.S. agreed to pay $819 million in arrears and forgive $107 million in peacekeeping costs if the UN applied it to U.S. arrears. Congress required reductions in the U.S. assessment for contributions to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping. The UN General Assembly reduced the regular budget assessment level to 22% and the peacekeeping share to 28%. The UN General Assembly reduced the regular budget assessment level to 22% and the peacekeeping share to 28%. The current arrears are close to 26.5%. Key U.N. Reform Recommendations and Proposals are outlined in the appendices."
