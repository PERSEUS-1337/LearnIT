    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, while the Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion. The House committee bill and the Senate bill for FY2019 would result in different levels of inflation-adjusted funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT) compared to FY2018. DOT's funding structure is unique, with most of its funding coming from trust funds and a significant portion being mandatory budget authority. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund have been major sources of funding for DOT in recent years. In FY2018, DOT's funding proportion changed significantly due to increased discretionary funding from trust funds. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget primarily not for grants. DOT's funding mainly comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with reauthorizations and budget apportionments being significant. Highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020. The authorization for federal aviation programs is set to expire on September 30, 2018, potentially impacting structure and funding. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal dollars. Adjusted for inflation, funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015, then began rising again in FY2016. Real funding in FY2016 and FY2017 was similar to FY2006, lower than FY2007-FY2011. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, supported by the federal motor fuels excise tax. The Highway Trust Fund has faced a shortfall due to stagnant federal gas tax rates since 1993. Revenues fall short of expenditures, leading to transfers from the general Treasury fund to maintain solvency. The fixed gas tax per gallon has not kept up with inflation or increased fuel efficiency, impacting the fund's sustainability. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption through 2024. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts flat gasoline consumption through 2024, offsetting increases in miles driven with fuel efficiency gains. Highway Trust Fund revenues are projected at $39-41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure grants in FY2018, with the Senate proposing $1 billion and the House recommending $750 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern over the Department of Transportation's criteria for grant selection. The TIGER grant program, originally called \"national infrastructure investment,\" aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding. It provides discretionary grants for projects with national or regional impacts. The program's selection criteria are under scrutiny, with the Senate Committee on Appropriations expressing concerns. The committee report prohibits the Department of Transportation from using an applicant's willingness to create new revenue sources as a selection criterion. The program is seen as crucial for projects like Amtrak's Gateway Program in the Northeast Corridor. The Gateway Program aims to replace a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. The $13 billion project is primarily funded by New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with a focus on regional and metropolitan projects due to congressional directives. The BUILD/TIGER program provides grants for transportation projects with low minimum grant thresholds. It is oversubscribed and receives many more applications than available funding. Congress has directed a portion of funding to go to rural areas, with the percentage increasing over the years. In FY2019, the House Appropriations Committee recommended that 33% of funding should go to rural projects. The BUILD/TIGER grant program allocates funding for transportation projects in major seaports and urban areas over 200,000 in population. The funding process has followed a consistent pattern in recent years, with the Trump Administration requesting no funding in FY2018 but Congress funding the program. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization of $140 million for FY2019 financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines. The Essential Air Service program in the U.S. seeks to maintain commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable flights. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for FY2019, $62 million less than FY2018. The House committee bill recommended $175 million, $20 million more than FY2018. The Senate-passed bill also recommends $175 million. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008, partly due to airlines reducing routes and adding new communities to the program. Congress made changes in 2012, including no new entrants and capping per-passenger subsidies. The Essential Air Service program in the U.S. aims to maintain commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable flights. Changes were made in 2012, such as capping per-passenger subsidies and limiting communities close to hub airports. Supporters argue it promotes economic development, while critics point out high subsidy costs and low passenger numbers at some airports. Congress also mandated positive train control installation on certain rail segments by 2015. The Positive Train Control (PTC) system aims to prevent incidents caused by train operator or dispatcher error. Freight railroads have spent billions to meet this requirement, with most tracks not in compliance by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for extension to 2020. Funding has been provided by Congress in recent years, but the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects for grants. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants, providing separate funding for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. Three new grant programs were authorized for intercity passenger rail development. The FY2019 budget allocated $738 million for Amtrak, with no funding for the new grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. In FY2017, Congress provided $98 million for three new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. Funding for intercity passenger rail development has historically been limited, with occasional increases such as the $10.5 billion appropriated in FY2009 and FY2010 for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants. The majority of the Federal Transit Administration's funding is directed towards state and local transit projects. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) allocates roughly $13 billion in funding to state and local transit agencies through various programs, including the Capital Investment Grants program (CIG), also known as the New Starts program. CIG funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions, with three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. Additionally, there is an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects seeking up to a 25% federal share. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, $1.6 billion less than FY2018. Funding is typically disbursed over years, with a focus on projects with multiyear grant agreements. Congress has expressed concern over the Administration's approach to the CIG program, which aims to fund projects with existing full funding grant agreements. The House Committee recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than FY2018, while the Senate-passed bill would provide $2.553 billion. The Trump Administration has not requested funding for new transit projects in its FY2018 or FY2019 DOT budget requests, taking the stance that state and local governments should fund these projects without federal assistance. However, Congress has not supported this policy proposal and has provided more than twice the funding requested by the FTA for the CIG program in both FY2018 and FY2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee report also highlighted FTA's failure to comply with congressional directives regarding improvements to the CIG program. The FTA has not complied with congressional directives to improve the CIG program due to lack of funding requests for new projects. Concerns have been raised about unnecessary delays in project development, with Transportation for America accusing FTA of deliberately prolonging the review process for transit projects, leading to increased costs for project sponsors. FTA denies these allegations. The FTA is facing criticism for delays in project reviews and funding limitations for New Starts grants. Congressional directives have lowered the federal share for New Starts projects, with the House proposing a limit of 50%. Critics argue that this makes highway projects more attractive, while advocates believe it allows FTA to support more projects with available funding. The challenges of funding transportation infrastructure include the distribution of federal funding by mode and state, making it difficult for projects involving multiple modes to receive significant federal funding. This situation is exemplified by Amtrak's Gateway Program, specifically the Hudson Tunnel replacement project. The Gateway Program aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for the project is limited, with the largest rail grant program in FY2017 funded at $68 million, increasing to $593 million in FY2018. In FY2018, the Capital Investment Grants program had $2.6 billion in funding, with intense competition. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by a previous agreement to share costs for the Hudson Tunnel project. Congress would need to provide the necessary funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 reports, but recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $240 million for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account, exceeding Amtrak's request for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion in grants for WMATA, with additional funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The FY2018 grant was the final installment of the $1.5 billion commitment, with the Administration requesting $120 million for FY2019. The House and Senate recommended $150 million, with a directive to extend the authorization for the grant. WMATA is facing maintenance backlog and safety concerns, leading to restrictions on federal funding usage. FTA assumed oversight of WMATA's safety compliance practices in 2015, conducting inspections and directing funds towards safety improvements. FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that 5% of their FY2017 transit funds would be withheld until they establish a new State Safety Oversight Program. The jurisdictions passed legislation to create the Metrorail Safety Commission, but funding will only be released once the agency is operational. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, but Congress would need to grant FRA the authority."
