    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1797.172 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to establish minimum standards for EMT-P training and scope of practice. Approval by the commission is required for adoption. The authority is solely responsible for EMT-P licensure and renewal. Each application for EMT-P licensure or renewal requires the applicant's social security number for identity verification. Criminal record information is used to determine eligibility for licensure. Fingerprint submission may not be necessary for renewal if previously submitted and no lapse in license. The authority charges fees for EMT-P licensure and renewal to ensure quality care. The basic fee is $125, subject to adjustment based on actual costs. Additional fees may apply for specific services. The authority may charge for services not shared by all applicants for licensure and renewal, such as specific services. The authority may charge fees for specific services related to EMT-P licensure, including competency testing, fingerprint checks, out-of-state training equivalency, continuing education verification, and replacement of lost licensure cards. Fees for individual services should not exceed the actual total cost of the licensure program. Additionally, the authority may provide nonconfidential information on EMS programs upon request, with fees not exceeding the cost of providing the information. Fees collected for the authority by a contracted entity for EMT-P services must be deposited into the Emergency Medical Services Personnel Fund within 30 days, unless specified otherwise in the contract."
