    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2655 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to specify the weekly benefit amount based on the individual's highest quarter wages. Weekly benefit amounts are specified in Section 2655 of the Unemployment Insurance Code based on the individual's highest quarter wages. The amounts range from $1,450 to $1,749.20. For disabilities starting between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 1991, if an individual's highest quarter wages exceed $1,749.20, the weekly benefit amount will be 55% of those wages divided by 13, not exceeding $266 or the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount. If the benefit is not a multiple of $1, it will be rounded up to the next dollar. For disabilities starting between January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2000, the weekly benefit amount is 55% of the individual's highest quarter wages exceeding $1,749.20, divided by 13, not exceeding $336. For disabilities starting between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2018, the weekly benefit amount is 55% of the individual's highest quarter wages exceeding $1,749.20, divided by 13, not exceeding the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount. For disabilities starting between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2022, the weekly benefit amount is $50 if the individual's highest quarter wages are less than $929. If the benefit is not a multiple of $1, it will be rounded up to the next dollar. When an individual's highest quarter wages are $929 or more but less than one-third of the state average quarterly wage, 70 percent of those wages divided by 13 is the weekly benefit amount, rounded up to the next dollar if necessary. An individual's weekly benefit amount is determined based on their highest quarter wages during the disability base period. It is calculated as either 23.3 percent of the state average weekly wage or 60 percent of the highest quarter wages divided by 13, whichever amount is greater. The weekly benefit amount cannot exceed the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount set by the Department of Industrial Relations. For disabilities starting on or after January 1, 2022, the weekly benefit amount is 55% of the highest quarter wages, not exceeding the maximum set by the Department of Industrial Relations. The state average quarterly wage is calculated as the state average weekly wage multiplied by 13. The state average quarterly wage is determined by multiplying the state average weekly wage by 13. A report on paid family leave and disability insurance utilization, benefit costs, and supplemental disability insurance contribution rates must be submitted to the Legislature by March 1, 2021. The report on paid family leave and disability insurance must include benefit costs, supplemental disability insurance contribution rates, and projections for the following three years. It should be submitted to specific legislative committees by March 1, 2021, and this section will be repealed on January 1, 2024. Section 3303 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to provide family temporary disability insurance benefits for bonding with a minor child or caring for a family member. Eligibility criteria include making a claim, a seven-day waiting period, and filing a required certificate. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2018.
