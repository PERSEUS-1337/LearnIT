    "content": "The \"Helping College Students Cross the Finish Line Act\" provides grants to institutions to assist undergraduate and vocational students with financial need in completing degree and certificate programs. The Secretary awards grants to institutions of higher education to establish financial assistance programs for eligible students. The program must award funds to at least 100 students per academic year who are enrolled at least half-time and academically able to complete their degree or certificate program within a year. The financial assistance program established by institutions of higher education awards grants to eligible students who are enrolled at least half-time, in good academic standing, have outstanding tuition payments, and are at risk of discontinuing their program due to financial constraints. The grant amount is determined by the institution. The financial assistance program at institutions of higher education awards grants to eligible students based on financial need. The grant amount is capped at $1,000 or the tuition amount the student cannot afford for a semester. Students can only receive grants for up to two semesters. The institution must also provide information on other financial aid options to students. The term 'covered student' refers to a student who receives a financial assistance award from a higher education institution but still has outstanding tuition. The Secretary requires these students to complete an online financial literacy survey covering budgeting, saving, student loan debt, and career planning. Additionally, institutions must submit annual reports to the Secretary detailing the number of students who received financial assistance awards. The institution that received an award under a financial assistance program must report the number of students who completed their degree or certificate program, those who enrolled in a higher-level program, those who obtained full-time employment with average salary, and any other necessary information to the Secretary. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of this section. Congress requires a report on the implementation of the financial assistance program, including aggregate data from all institutions, program analysis, suggestions for improvement, and any other necessary information. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2015 through 2020."
