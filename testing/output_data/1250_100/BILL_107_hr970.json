    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allocate $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent years for the implementation of an Effective Prevention Program. Subparts and sections are redesignated for clarity and organization. SEC. 4121 allocates $25,000,000 for the implementation of a Comprehensive Prevention Technical Assistance Grants program. The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to States for prevention programs meeting high scientific standards. States must submit a plan detailing grant selection criteria, funding only well-documented programs, disseminating research-based materials, and providing technical assistance. The State educational agency must evaluate the implementation of prevention programs, ensure local programs meet requirements, supplement other funds, and meet additional criteria as required by the Secretary. SEC. 4122. RESERVATIONS AND ALLOCATIONS. The Secretary reserves and allocates funds among States for implementing programs under this subpart. If a State does not meet plan requirements, funds are reallocated to other States. Funds can only be used for program implementation. SEC. 4123. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. Each State educational agency receiving funds under this subpart must provide competitive grants to local educational agencies. Priority is given to agencies with demonstrated need, grants must support startup costs for prevention plans, and awards should be distributed equitably across different regions and school types. The State educational agency can use up to 5 percent of funds for administrative expenses, evaluation, and technical assistance. This includes informing local educational agencies about effective prevention approaches. \"SEC. 4124. LOCAL AWARDS.\" To be eligible for a subgrant, a local educational agency must submit an application and plan to the State educational agency. The grant must be used for implementing prevention programs based on reliable research, addressing various aspects of children and adolescents' health, and providing developmentally appropriate activities. The interventions for prevention programs must assist children and adolescents in improving cognitive, affective, and behavioral skills, ensure active engagement, involve parents and professionals in planning, provide staff training, set measurable goals, utilize external support, and coordinate resources effectively. The State will use all resources available to coordinate services for a comprehensive prevention effort."
