    "content": "During hard and soft market cycles in the insurance industry, prices and underwriting standards fluctuate. Consumers may struggle to find affordable insurance during hard markets, leading to legislative attention at the state level. Alternative market entities have been created to increase insurance availability. The alternative market, consisting of risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups, was authorized by Congress in 1981 to expand insurance supply by simplifying state regulations. Interest in these groups has grown due to challenges in accessing affordable insurance. Some suggest expanding the Liability Risk Retention Act to increase insurance supply beyond current liability coverage. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address this issue. Legislation (H.R. 2126) introduced in the 112th Congress aims to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws to allow risk retention groups to cover commercial property risks. It also includes changes to enforcement mechanisms and additional corporate governance requirements for risk retention groups. The director of the Federal Insurance Office could issue determinations on state regulation of RRGs and RPGs. Corporate governance standards would include independent directors, audit committees, written governance standards, and limited service provider contracts. H.R. 4802, introduced in 2010, expanded consumer disclosure and imposed a fiduciary duty on RRG directors. The bill H.R. 4802 introduced in 2010 by Representative Dennis Moore, along with other representatives, included changes such as replacing the \"Secretary of the Treasury\" with the \"Director of the Federal Insurance Office\" for overseeing state compliance with federal law. A section calling for a study by the Comptroller General was deleted, but a similar study was requested from the Government Accountability Office. The bill was discussed in a hearing on insurance regulatory reform and marked up by the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises. H.R. 5792, introduced in the 110th Congress, aimed to expand LRRA exemptions for commercial property insurance and implement corporate governance standards for Risk Retention Groups (RRGs). The bill required RRGs offering property coverage to be U.S.-licensed insurance companies and mandated governance practices like independent directors and audit committees. RRGs are state-chartered insurance companies allowed to insure commercial liability risks but not property/casualty risks. Risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups are entities formed by businesses or government entities facing similar risks to purchase insurance. Risk retention groups are not regulated in the same way as traditional insurance companies and operate outside of the state where they are chartered. The advantages of forming such groups include different regulatory treatment and potential cost savings. Insurers operating outside their domiciliary state must comply with multiple state regulations, creating a burden due to varying laws. Some in the insurance industry advocate for a federal charter to replace or supplement the current state system. Risk retention groups are exempt from licensing requirements in all states, allowing them to do business freely after registering with state regulators. Risk retention groups are exempt from most state insurance laws, but must still comply with laws on fraudulent practices and unfair claim settlements. They are subject to state premium taxes and financial oversight, although less stringent than for regular insurers. In case of insolvency, policyholders cannot rely on state guaranty funds. Risk purchasing groups have a limited exemption from state laws. The \"Product Liability Risk Retention Act\" of 1981 exempted risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups from state insurance laws, allowing them to purchase insurance for their members without restrictions. This act was created in response to difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance and aimed to provide alternatives to the traditional insurance market. The 1981 \"Product Liability Risk Retention Act\" exempted risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups from state insurance laws, allowing them to purchase insurance without restrictions. The act limited membership to specific business entities and required groups to be chartered as insurers in certain jurisdictions. It preempted state laws that hindered purchasing insurance and aimed to provide alternatives to traditional insurance markets. In 1983, a Clarification of the Risk Retention Act was passed to address discrepancies in defining \"product liability\" between state tort laws and the federal statute. This clarified that the federal definitions would control for the Risk Retention Act. Congressional interest in insurance issues continued in the mid-1980s as the market hardened, leading to reconsideration of the 1981 act and the introduction of bills to expand provisions for consumers. Congress passed S. 2129 (P.L. 99-563), renaming the 1981 act the \"Liability Risk Retention Act\" and expanding the scope of insurance to include most types of commercial liability insurance. The law allowed any business, state or local governments, or governmental entities to form groups as long as members were engaged in similar business activities or risks. Foreign-based risk retention groups were not retroactively included, limiting expansion into other commercial liability insurance types. Increased oversight measures were also implemented, such as filing documentation in non-chartering states. The Liability Risk Retention Act allowed businesses and entities to form groups for commercial liability insurance, with oversight measures like filing documentation in non-chartering states. Market reaction was swift, with 52 risk retention groups created by 1988, growing to 79 in 1991. The number plateaued at 72 in 2001, but the total premium amount continued to increase to $944 million. In the period from 1987 to 2001, 142 risk retention groups were formed and 73 retired. Reasons for retirement varied, including insolvency, status changes, and market affordability. The insurance market hardened in 2001 due to interest rate and stock market downturns, as well as losses from the September 11 attacks. Interest in risk retention groups increased as insurance prices rose, with the number of groups and premiums steadily rising from 2001 to 245 groups and $2.6 billion in premiums. The number of Risk Retention Groups (RRGs) increased steadily from 72 groups and $994 million in premium in 2001 to 245 groups and $2.6 billion in premiums in 2006. The number of RRG insureds fluctuated, declining to 139,837 in 2002 before growing to nearly 218,000 in 2006. Growth in RRGs during the early 2000s was prominent in the health care sector, with nursing homes showing significant growth. This growth was driven by difficulties in obtaining medical malpractice insurance. The growth of Risk Retention Groups (RRGs) has not been without problems, as seen in the decline of insured individuals from 2001 to 2004 due to the liquidation of three Tennessee-domiciled groups. This was caused by the insolvency of a Virginia-based insurer who provided reinsurance for these RRGs. Individual policyholders of regular insurance may not be protected in case of insurer insolvency if they are reinsured by this company. The Virginia company's insolvency led to the decline of insured individuals from 2001 to 2004, affecting policyholders of companies reinsured by this company. These policyholders are considered creditors, not insureds, with lower priority claims on assets. Risk retention groups are prohibited from state guaranty funds, leading to class action lawsuits seeking protection and damages. The insolvency of National Warranty Insurance Risk Retention Group, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, also drew attention. The National Warranty Insurance Risk Retention Group, with approximately 580 members, sold vehicle service contracts through over 5,000 auto dealerships in 49 states. The group's insolvency blurred the line between insureds and owners, as it acted as both an administrator and insurer. Efforts have been made to expand the Risk Retention Act to include commercial property and casualty insurance. The National Warranty Insurance Risk Retention Group faced insolvency, leading to discussions about expanding the Risk Retention Act to include commercial property and casualty insurance. The National Conference of Insurance Legislators and Consumer Federation of America support the expansion, while some insurance regulators, like Lawrence Mirel and Leonard Crouse, have also expressed support. However, doubts have been raised, with former Nebraska insurance director Tim Wagner opposing the expansion due to concerns about consumer protection and regulatory authority. The NAIC has yet to adopt a resolution on the matter. The Risk Retention Working Group was created to address issues with risk retention groups, proposing corporate governance standards. The U.S. Government Accountability Office highlighted problems in risk retention groups in a 2005 report. The debate on LRRA expansion revolves around availability vs. reliability of insurance, with arguments for expansion focusing on market failures and regulatory shortcomings. Arguments against expansion emphasize the risks of selling insurance without proper regulatory standards. The debate on LRRA expansion revolves around the dangers of selling insurance without proper regulatory standards. Recent legislation in Congress has addressed concerns about the reliability of risk retention groups through provisions on corporate governance and disclosure. Arguments for expansion focus on market failures, while arguments against emphasize the risks of inadequate regulation. The debate on LRRA expansion revolves around the impact of risk retention groups, which are unaccountable to state regulators. Doubters question their significance in the property/casualty market. The arguments for and against expansion center on the level of regulation needed in insurance markets, with some viewing insurance as a public good requiring heavy regulation, while others advocate for a more market-driven approach. Congress faces the challenge of balancing availability and reliability in insurance regulation. The market for commercial insurance is usually less regulated due to the perceived sophistication of businesses, while individual consumer insurance markets, like homeowners and auto, tend to be more regulated. Internationally, insurance markets are generally less regulated compared to the United States. State guaranty funds operate with low caps on payouts to policyholders from insolvent insurers, reflecting differential regulatory approaches based on consumer sophistication. The low caps on guaranty fund payouts to policyholders imply that consumers with low claims are fully protected, while those with high claims are only partially protected. This affects risk retention groups, where businesses face potentially large claims. Despite risk retention groups having a small market share compared to the overall insurance market, they can still impact prices and availability. Anecdotal cases, like the Pennsylvania nursing home risk retention group, suggest that the act is expanding availability. The Risk Retention Acts have expanded insurance availability, especially in local areas with supply difficulties. The federal role in insurance regulation has been a topic of debate, with some advocating for increased federal involvement. The Dodd-Frank Act includes insurance provisions, but the discussion on the federal role in insurance regulation is expected to continue. The Risk Retention Acts aimed to address supply issues in the insurance regulatory system by enforcing mutual state recognition without extensive federal regulation. These acts offer insight into how Congress approaches insurance regulation problems today."
