The Congress finds that the Joint Declaration between the UK and China on Hong Kong's reversion to China in 1997 is a binding agreement ensuring Hong Kong's autonomy and human rights.

Despite assurances of autonomy and respect for basic rights in Hong Kong, there have been attempts by Chinese officials to infringe upon the region's autonomy. This includes proposals to obtain confidential files on civil servants and dissolve the democratically elected Legislative Council in 1997. The reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997 led to the appointment of a provisional legislature, delineation of permitted speech and association, warnings to religious institutions, and the repeal or amendment of certain Hong Kong ordinances. This has significant implications for the United States.
