The country has a long history of promoting an open and rules-based system that benefits both the U.S. and foreign investors. The Trump Administration has not yet outlined its foreign investment policy, but has expressed a welcoming stance towards foreign investment. In 2016, the U.S. had around $6.4 trillion in inward foreign direct investment, out of a total global inward direct investment of $26.7 trillion. In 2016, the United States had around $6.4 trillion in inward foreign direct investment, making it the largest investor globally. The total global inward direct investment position was recorded at approximately $26.7 trillion. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment position: historical cost, current cost, and market value. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. increased by $876 billion at market value in 2016, reaching a total cumulative FDI of $7.4 trillion. In 2016, the United States had $7.4 trillion in investment position at market value, with $4.0 trillion at current cost and $3.5 trillion at historical cost. The United Kingdom and Japan compete as the largest foreign direct investors in the U.S. economy. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. dropped in 2014 due to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone. Foreign direct investment flows have not fully recovered since 2007, but investments in the U.S. surpassed 2007 levels in 2015 and 2016. Foreign direct investment in the United States increased in 2016, with a 10% drop in net equity investments by foreign-owned firms. Equity capital accounted for 53.0% of foreign direct investment in the U.S., raising questions about the impact on the economy. Global flows in 2015 grew by 38% to $1.76 trillion, below the peak in 2007. Foreign direct investment in developed economies increased by 85% in 2015, while investment in developing countries increased by 9.5%. Foreign direct investment in the United States increased in 2016, with a 10% drop in net equity investments by foreign-owned firms. Foreign firms relied heavily on equity investment, accounting for nearly 67% of investment funds in 2016. Intercompany debt shifted from a net outflow in 2015 to positive inflows in 2016. U.S. direct investment abroad rose by 1.5% in 2015 to reach $349 billion. The U.S. direct investment abroad for 2016 is projected to increase by 2.4% to $357 billion, with reinvested earnings accounting for 87% of the total. Foreign firms' investment spending in the U.S. decreased to 8.2% in 2013 from 10.4% in 2012. Better credit conditions and economic growth led to increased mergers and acquisitions. U.S. trade involves significant intrafirm trade, with total trade in 2014 amounting to $1.6 trillion in exports and $2.3 trillion in imports. Foreign direct investment in the United States by multinational companies totaled $315 billion in exports and imports, with intrafirm trade accounting for 31% of exports and 35% of imports. Developed economies dominate investment spending, particularly in the manufacturing sector, valued at $1.2 trillion in 2015. Other sectors attracting foreign direct investment include finance, insurance, wholesale trade, and information. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector is concentrated in chemicals and transport, accounting for half of all investments. Labor productivity in the manufacturing sector has doubled from 1993 to 2010, outperforming other sectors and advanced economies. Unit labor costs in the U.S. decreased by 15% from 2002 to 2011, while rising in 18 other countries. Additionally, there was a significant increase in investments in commercial real estate in 2015. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. saw a significant increase in the commercial real estate sector in 2015, with a one-third rise compared to 2014. Investments in manufacturing also rose by nearly one-fourth, while the banking sector experienced a 10% decrease in foreign direct investment spending. The United Kingdom is the largest foreign direct investor in the U.S., followed by Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, and France. This suggests a form of international specialization in investment patterns among foreign multinational firms. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is dominated by countries like the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Canada across various sectors such as petroleum, wholesale trade, retail trade, information, banking, and finance. These countries account for a significant portion of investments in the manufacturing sector, with Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, France, and Germany leading the way. Canada's $62 billion investment in the U.S. finance and insurance sectors leads foreign direct investment, employing over 6.6 million U.S. workers. New investments, including greenfield investments, totaled $421 billion in 2015, showing a 68% increase. In 2015, foreign investors acquired 791 existing U.S. firms, accounting for 43% of foreign direct investment. Acquisitions of existing U.S. firms made up over 96% of new foreign investments. U.S. affiliates of foreign firms typically accounted for over 80% of total transactions. Acquisitions of existing U.S. firms also accounted for 99% of employment associated with foreign investment in 2015. National security concerns have become more prominent in investment policies in recent years. Security-related concerns have led countries to adopt new measures to restrict foreign investment, with a focus on national security reviews. The United States addresses these concerns through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews transactions to assess threats to national security, foreign government control, and critical infrastructure control. The President has the authority to block proposed transactions. The CFIUS process allows the President to block foreign investment transactions that threaten national security. In a report to Congress, CFIUS noted that a significant portion of notified transactions were in the manufacturing sector, with investments in finance, information, and services sectors also common. Notifying CFIUS is voluntary but failing to do so could lead to future review and possible divestiture. The growing international presence of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in finance, information, and services sectors is raising concerns over economic and security implications. An estimated 22% of the world's largest firms are now under state control, leading to worries about preferential treatment and anticompetitive effects. Close associations between firms and governments may blur the distinction between them. The OECD found little evidence that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have a significant impact on their international economic performance. Concerns exist about SOEs engaging in foreign investments that could compromise national security objectives. By the end of 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with more than 32,000 foreign affiliates, while foreign firms had over 6,600 affiliates in the United States. U.S. parent companies employed over 26 million workers in the U.S. U.S. parent companies employ over 26 million workers in the U.S., while U.S. firms employ 13.8 million workers abroad. Foreign firms employ 6.6 million workers in the U.S., making up less than 4% of the labor force. U.S. parent companies are more efficient with higher output per employee compared to U.S. affiliates and foreign firms. Foreign firms in the U.S. are more capital intensive. Foreign affiliates of U.S. firms have higher gross output, but U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have higher total sales. Foreign firms operating in the United States have higher total sales compared to U.S. affiliates of foreign firms. They also pay more in taxes to foreign governments. These foreign firms have a presence in every state, with California having the highest employment numbers. In 2014, manufacturing sector employment by foreign firms was at 38%, with an average annual compensation of $82,000 per worker. Retail and wholesale trade accounted for 8% and 9% of total affiliate employment, respectively. Foreign firms operating in the United States have a significant presence in various sectors. Dutch-affiliated firms are the largest employers in the retail trade sector, while Japanese and German firms dominate the wholesale trade sector. British and Japanese firms lead in professional services. The finance sector has the highest average employee compensation at $187,000, with British, Canadian, Swiss, French, and Dutch firms employing three-fourths of the workforce. Foreign affiliates invested heavily in the U.S. economy in 2014, with expenditures on new plants and equipment, imports, and exports totaling billions of dollars. Since 1980, foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy has increased significantly, reaching $434 billion in goods. The performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to U.S.-owned ones shows mixed results, with historically lower rates of return for foreign-owned firms, although the gap has narrowed over time. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms seem to be outperforming their U.S. counterparts, despite accounting for less than 3% of all establishments. Foreign-owned manufacturing establishments in the U.S. account for less than 3% of all establishments but have significantly higher value added and shipments compared to other manufacturing establishments. They also have larger plant sizes, higher wages, productivity, and output per worker, as well as higher capital intensity in multiple industries. However, comparisons between foreign-owned and U.S.-owned firms should be viewed with caution due to differences in firm sizes and compositions. Foreign direct investment in the United States rose sharply in 2015, driven by a growing economy and rising equity values. Globally, foreign direct investment inflows increased by 38% to $1.7 trillion in 2015, but have not yet reached pre-financial-crisis levels. Foreign firms investing in the U.S. are typically large with proven technologies, opting for larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits. Small foreign ventures with unproven technologies are less likely to invest overseas. Foreign direct investment inflows in 2007 were $2.0 trillion, with some regions experiencing a slowdown in 2015. The U.S. economy's growth rate relative to other advanced economies, low interest rates, and stable price inflation may lead to an increase in foreign direct investment. Concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions are key factors influencing public perception of foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. raises concerns about economic and national security interests, despite being a prime destination for such investments. Job security and potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions are key factors influencing public perception. The U.S. economy's growth rate and stable inflation may attract more foreign investments in the future."
