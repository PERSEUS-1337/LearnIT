    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act, known as the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act,\" defines key terms such as casual collecting, Secretary, and Federal lands. Casual collecting involves non-commercial personal use of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources with minimal disturbance to the Earth's surface. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture for respective lands. Federal lands are those controlled or administered by the Secretary of the Interior, excluding Indian lands. The term \"Indian lands\" refers to lands of Indian tribes or individuals held in trust or with restrictions against alienation by the United States. The term \"State\" includes the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. A \"paleontological resource\" encompasses fossilized remains, traces, or imprints providing information about Earth's history, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources. The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act define cultural items protected under the law. The Secretary is responsible for managing and protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, developing plans for inventory, monitoring, and scientific use, emphasizing coordination with non-Federal partners. There is a requirement for coordination between the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Additionally, a public awareness and education program will be established to highlight the significance of paleontological resources. The Secretary may issue permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, with exceptions for casual collecting on certain lands. Permits are granted based on qualifications and the purpose of furthering knowledge or public education. Permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands are issued by the Secretary based on qualifications and the purpose of furthering knowledge or public education. The permits contain terms ensuring that collected resources remain property of the United States, are preserved for public access, and locality data is not released without permission. Permit specifications also include conditions necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. The Secretary has the authority to modify, suspend, or revoke permits issued for collecting paleontological resources for various reasons, including violations of permit terms or conditions. Permits will be revoked if individuals working under them are convicted under specific sections or assessed civil penalties. The Secretary can also restrict access to or close areas under their jurisdiction to protect paleontological resources and ensure public safety. SEC. 6. CURATION OF RESOURCES. Paleontological resources collected under a permit must be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary can make agreements with non-Federal repositories for curation. SEC. 7. PROHIBITED ACTS; CRIMINAL PENALTIES. A person is prohibited from excavating, damaging, or altering paleontological resources on Federal lands without following the regulations. It is also illegal to exchange, transport, export, receive, sell, or purchase these resources if they were obtained unlawfully from Federal lands. Additionally, false labeling of paleontological resources is prohibited. A person who knowingly violates regulations regarding paleontological resources on Federal lands may face fines or imprisonment. There is an exception for resources lawfully possessed before the enactment of the Act. Civil penalties may be imposed on individuals who knowingly violate regulations regarding paleontological resources on Federal lands. Individuals who violate regulations or permits under the Act may face penalties determined by the Secretary, taking into account factors such as the value of the paleontological resource, restoration costs, and any other relevant factors. Repeat violations by the same person result in increased penalties. The penalties for violating regulations or permits under the Act may be doubled for subsequent violations by the same person. The maximum penalty for any one violation is double the cost of response, restoration, and repair, plus double the value of resources damaged or not recovered. Violators can petition for judicial review within 30 days of the penalty assessment. The court will review the record before the Secretary and uphold the action if supported by substantial evidence. Failure to pay the penalty within 30 days may result in the Secretary requesting the Attorney General to collect the penalty through a civil action in a district court. The district court has jurisdiction to hear and decide actions related to civil penalties. The validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty are not subject to review. Failure to pay the penalty may result in additional fees and costs for collection proceedings. Hearings during proceedings must follow section 554 of title 5, United States Code. Penalties collected are used to protect, restore, or repair paleontological resources and sites. The purpose of the legislation is to acquire and protect paleontological resources and sites, provide educational materials to the public, and offer rewards as specified in section 9. SEC. 9. REWARDS AND FORFEITURE. The Secretary may pay rewards from penalties collected under section 7 or 8 to individuals providing information leading to civil or criminal violations. Forfeiture of paleontological resources and related equipment is mandated for violations under section 7 or 8. The Secretary may transfer seized paleontological resources to educational institutions for scientific or educational purposes, following the procedures outlined in relevant laws. SEC. 10. CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nInformation about paleontological resources requiring a permit is confidential unless disclosure serves the Act's purpose, poses no risk to the resource, and complies with laws.\n\nSEC. 11. REGULATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary will issue regulations promptly after the Act's enactment, allowing for public input.\n\nSEC. 12. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. Nothing in this Act shall invalidate, modify, or impose additional restrictions on activities permitted under various mining and land management laws. It also does not affect existing laws on reclamation and multiple uses of Federal lands, nor does it require permits for casual collecting of certain natural resources. The Act does not protect certain rock, mineral, or fossil resources, does not impact non-Federal lands, does not limit other laws protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, and does not grant rights to individuals not acting as US officers or employees. Non-officers cannot sue in US courts to enforce this Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
