    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings by Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, and well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, self-esteem, and overall health. The increasing rates of obesity among young people and its economic impact are also mentioned. The importance of physical education for children's development and health is emphasized by Congress. Inactivity and poor diet contribute to 300,000 deaths annually in the US. Physically fit adults have lower risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not as active as they should be, with less than 1 in 4 getting enough vigorous activity. Recommendations for daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12 have not seen much progress since 1996. Quality physical education is essential for all students from kindergarten to grade 12 to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity, promoting healthy and active lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Applications and program requirements are outlined. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes of instructional physical education per week, fitness education, and instruction in various motor skills to improve overall well-being. The physical education program aims to enhance the development of children in various aspects such as cognitive concepts, social skills, physical activity, and nutrition. Teachers must have baccalaureate degrees and receive ongoing professional development. Special Rule: Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC program activities are not considered part of the physical education program assisted under this part. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as those serving large and small student populations. Funds can include participation of private school and home-schooled students. Reporting is required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving funding for multiyear grants or contracts. The Secretary is required to report to Congress on the success of programs improving physical fitness and make recommendations for their continuation. Administrative costs are limited to 7% of grant funds, and funds must supplement, not supplant, existing resources. The Federal share for project assistance is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations includes $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2004 for this purpose."
