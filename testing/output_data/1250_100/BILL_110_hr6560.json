    "content": "The Earned Import Allowance Program is added to the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The Earned Import Allowance Program allows eligible apparel articles from eligible countries to enter the US duty-free if accompanied by an import allowance certificate reflecting fabric credits. Conversion factors for square meter equivalents are determined according to the US Department of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a program to provide import allowance certificates to producers or entities controlling production of eligible apparel articles in eligible countries. Credits will be issued based on qualifying fabric purchases for manufacturing articles eligible for preferential treatment. The program established by the Secretary of Commerce provides import allowance certificates to producers or entities controlling production in eligible countries. Credits can be redeemed for earned import allowance certificates by producers or entities, and textile mills in the US exporting qualifying fabric must submit documentation verifying the export to eligible countries. The Secretary of Commerce may require documentation to verify purchases of qualifying fabric by producers or entities controlling production. Information related to qualifying fabric purchases may be shared with relevant parties. The program aims to facilitate electronic submission, storage, retrieval, and disclosure of information, including earned import allowance certificates. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to reconcile discrepancies in the provided information. The Secretary of Commerce may establish procedures by September 30, 2008, to verify information discrepancies under subparagraph (C) or (D). Definitions for the program include terms like 'appropriate congressional committees,' 'eligible apparel articles,' and 'eligible country' (Dominican Republic). The term 'eligible country' refers to the Dominican Republic, and 'qualifying fabric' is defined as cotton fabric made in the US from US yarns suitable for apparel production. Fabric with nylon filament yarn or non-US yarns may still qualify under certain conditions. Fabric eligible as qualifying fabric must meet certain criteria, including a restriction on the total weight of non-US yarns and fibers. Additionally, the presence of designated non-commercially available yarns or fibers does not disqualify the fabric. The United States International Trade Commission conducts an annual review of the program under this section to evaluate its effectiveness and make recommendations for improvements. A report on the review results is submitted to the appropriate congressional committees annually. The program under this section shall be in effect for a 10-year period starting when certain conditions are met. It applies to qualifying fabric exported to an eligible country after August 1, 2007. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents for the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The Earned Import Allowance Program is established under Sec. 404 for a 10-year period starting when specific conditions are met. It applies to qualifying fabric exported to an eligible country after August 1, 2007. Section 112 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act is amended to clarify the definition of a \"lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country\" based on per capita gross national product criteria. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is amended to include Botswana, Namibia, and Mauritius as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. The changes apply to goods entered after 15 days from the enactment date. The United States International Trade Commission will review and report on textile and apparel inputs that can be competitively produced in these countries. The Comptroller General will submit a report to congressional committees with recommendations for changes to US trade preference programs, including the African Growth and Opportunity Act, to boost investment and competitiveness in sub-Saharan African countries in textile production. The term \"committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries\" is defined in a specific section of the Trade Act of 1974. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to a section of Public Law 109-432. SEC. 3. Generalized System of Preferences amended to extend deadline to December 31, 2009. SEC. 4. Customs user fees deadlines amended to January 31, 2018. Repeal of sections in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. SEC. 5. Increase in corporate estimated taxes percentage by 1.75 points. SEC. 6. Technical corrections made. SEC. 6.
