    "content": "PLACEMENT PROGRAMS FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY REDUCTION IN FORCE ACTIONS. The \"Public Servant Priority Placement Act of 1995\" establishes placement programs for Federal employees affected by reduction in force actions. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must establish a Government-wide program within 180 days to facilitate employment placement for affected employees. The agency placement program established under the \"Public Servant Priority Placement Act of 1995\" requires offering vacant positions to qualified employees affected by reduction in force actions within the same commuting area. The Government-wide placement program coordinates with agency programs for placing employees affected by reduction in force. It offers vacant positions to qualified employees from other agencies if the position cannot be filled internally and meets certain criteria. The interagency placement program coordinates with agency programs for placing employees affected by reduction in force. It offers vacant positions to qualified employees from other agencies within the commuting area of their residence or last held position. The program does not affect existing priority placement programs within the Department of Defense. Technical and conforming amendments are made to section headings and the table of sections. The code is amended by replacing the item related to the second section 3329 with a new provision regarding a Government-wide list of vacant positions. The code is amended to include a Government-wide list of vacant positions and placement programs for Federal employees affected by reduction in force actions."
