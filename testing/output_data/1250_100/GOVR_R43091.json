    "content": "The U.S. Congress has been addressing the issue of state courts considering a servicemember's military service in child custody cases since 2007. Military members with custody of dependents may face custody battles when deployed, requiring contingency plans for their care. The proposed legislation aims to prevent a servicemember's deployment from affecting child custody decisions. There is a debate over federal intervention in child custody issues, with proponents arguing for federal protection of servicemembers' rights. The proposed military child custody legislation, H.R. 1898, seeks to address child custody issues arising from increased deployments of servicemembers. Concerns include state courts considering deployments in custody decisions, impacting military children's welfare and servicemembers' ability to serve effectively. Approximately 142,000 Armed Forces members are single custodians of minor children, with complex situations involving re-marriage and custody arrangements. Proponents of federal child custody legislation argue that the lack of uniform state laws complicates custody matters for deployed military parents. They propose a national standard to prevent state courts from using deployment against servicemembers in custody determinations. Opponents believe this legislation infringes on states' rights to handle family law matters. The historical precedent of a state's right to adjudicate family law matters may prioritize the legal rights of the servicemember over the best interest of the child. Federal legislation for military child custody cases is driven by Congress's authority to support the armed forces. State courts potentially using military service against servicemembers in child custody cases was highlighted by the case of Kentucky National Guard Lieutenant Eva Slusher. Lt. Slusher regained custody of her daughter after a legal battle. Proposed legislation aims to establish a national standard for child custody cases involving military servicemembers, mandating reinstatement of custody orders post-deployment unless not in the child's best interest. Deployment cannot be the sole factor in custody decisions. The proposed legislation aims to establish a national standard for child custody cases involving military servicemembers, prohibiting deployment as the sole factor in custody decisions. It also clarifies that it does not create a Federal right of action or jurisdiction, and defers to State laws providing higher protection for deploying servicemembers. The legislation has passed in the House multiple times but has faced challenges in the Senate due to concerns about preempting State laws on child custody. The only existing federal protection for single-parent servicemembers in custody disputes is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protection for servicemembers in child custody disputes by granting a stay of legal proceedings, including child custody cases, during military service. Amendments in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act clarified the SCRA's applicability to child custody cases. The SCRA grants stays of legal proceedings for servicemembers in child custody disputes, but additional stays are discretionary after the first 90 days post-deployment. Critics argue the SCRA is insufficient in protecting servicemembers' rights in custody cases, as it does not prevent courts from considering military service against them or provide guidance on temporary custody arrangements. The SCRA provides protection for military parents in child custody cases, preventing permanent changes in parental rights until a reasonable time after the servicemember's return. The DOD has raised concerns about the lack of adherence to SCRA guidelines in high-visibility custody cases, leading to a need for better education on the law's provisions. The legislative debate revolves around the conflict between federal protection of servicemembers' rights in child custody cases and state jurisdiction. Proponents argue for federal legislation to establish a national standard, preventing servicemembers from being disadvantaged by varying state laws. Proponents advocate for federal legislation to create a national standard for resolving military child custody cases, aiming to address inconsistencies among states and enhance military readiness. Opponents argue that child custody is a state law matter and federalizing it would hinder states from passing or improving laws protecting servicemembers. The American Bar Association argues against the creation of a single national standard for the return of child custody after a deployment, stating that each case is unique and should be handled by state courts, not federal law. They believe that federal involvement in child custody cases would lead to federal court decisions by judges unfamiliar with family law. Opponents argue against federal judges making final custody determinations, citing increased cost, delay, and uncertainty. They believe states' residency requirements prevent \"venue shopping.\" Both sides agree on avoiding bias against military parents, but disagree on the impact of deployment on the child's best interest. The ultimate criteria for child custody decisions is the \"best interest of the child,\" considering various factors like parental wishes and relationships. The child's best interest is a key factor in custody decisions, considering various aspects such as the child's comfort, mental and physical health, and relationships with family members. While deployment is not the sole factor in custody decisions, it is considered along with other factors. Supporters of federal legislation argue for a standard to prevent courts from using deployment against servicemembers in custody cases, while opponents cite a DOD study showing deployment is not the sole factor in custody decisions. Opponents argue against federal child custody legislation that would prioritize servicemembers' rights over the best interest of the child in custody cases involving deployment. They believe such legislation could allow losers of state-level custody cases to seek better outcomes in federal court, despite claims that it would not federalize the cases. The American Bar Association views the language in the proposed legislation as potentially misleading. The American Bar Association believes that federal child custody legislation, such as H.R. 1898, could lead to federal court involvement in military child custody cases. The legislation does not prevent removal to federal court under 28 USC \u00a7 1442a, potentially adding delays to custody litigation. The proposed legislation does not prevent removal to federal court. Despite receiving support in the House, federal child custody bills have not passed in the Senate since 2008. Senate concerns include federal intrusion in state matters and the belief that the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act already protects military personnel in custody disputes. Senator John McCain emphasized the traditional state jurisdiction over child custody laws in a letter to Representative Turner. I suggest caution in federal legislation preempting States on child custody issues due to historical deference to State legislatures. Concerns raised by Senate Veterans' Committee and American Bar Association oppose proposed modifications to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Senate Armed Services Committee supports acquiring more data before making a decision. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports acquiring more data on child custody disputes involving deployed or deploying members of the armed forces before considering federal legislation. They emphasize personal responsibility of the servicemember and the DOD's oversight in preparing effective family care plans. The National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1390) emphasizes the importance of properly prepared Family Care Plans for military readiness and national defense. These plans help members of the Armed Forces provide for their family members during deployments or temporary duty, minimizing legal difficulties and allowing servicemembers to focus on their military duties. Family Care Plans are not legally binding but are effective in arranging care for dependents. Family Care Plans are important for military readiness and national defense, helping servicemembers provide for their family during deployments. While not legally binding, they can be used as supporting evidence in custody disputes. The Senate committee recommended obtaining the views of the Council of Governors on legislative proposals related to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Senate committee recommended seeking the views of State Governors before enacting federal legislation that could impact child custody disputes involving deployed service members. This recommendation was not included in the final Senate version of the FY2013 NDAA. The SASC recommendation to seek State Governors' views on federal child custody legislation was not included in the final FY2013 NDAA. DOD generally opposes such legislation, except for a brief period in early 2011. Former Secretary Gates expressed opposition to federal child custody legislation in a 2009 letter to Representative Turner. Secretary Gates acknowledged steps to protect Service members in child custody cases, including contacting governors to pass legislation, addressing custody concerns in key issues, improving liaison efforts, and involving military legal officials. The Department of Defense is working with the American Bar Association to provide free legal representation for Service members in child custody cases. They are also updating Family Care Plans across the military services to resolve issues in favor of Service members. The Department opposes new federal legislation that could disrupt State domestic schemes and increase costs and delays. The Department of Defense supports State legislation addressing parents in military service, recognizing the complexities of balancing servicemember interests with child welfare. DoD is updating Family Care Plan guidance to further address these issues. Although H.R. 2647 Section 584 did not pass, the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act requires a report on child custody disputes involving deployed service members. The Department of Defense conducted a report on child custody disputes involving deployed service members, concluding that no custody battles are decided solely based on military service. It emphasized that state legislatures are best suited to balance the interests of servicemembers and the best interest of the child, discouraging federal legislation in this area. The Department of Defense report emphasized that child custody disputes involving deployed service members are best handled by state courts, not federal courts. There is no evidence of a trend in family courts to remove custody solely due to deployment. Legislation mandating a specific outcome based on a single factor is deemed unworkable, and state-level legislation is seen as more effective in addressing child custody issues related to military service. The House Armed Services Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the Department of Defense's report on child custody disputes involving deployed servicemembers. They were concerned that the report focused only on cases where military service was the sole factor in custody decisions, rather than cases where it was a contributing factor. The committee emphasized the importance of early consultation with non-custodial parents to minimize disruptions in custody arrangements during deployment. The Department of Defense faced challenges in gathering data for a report on child custody issues affecting deployed servicemembers. The committee supports legislative measures to protect servicemembers and their children from custody disputes during deployment. Secretary Gates reversed his position on federal child custody legislation in a letter to Representative Turner, stating the Department of Defense should consider crafting legislation to provide uniform protection for service members in custody cases involving military service as the sole factor. This change in stance raised questions about DOD's support for the legislation after Gates' departure in July 2011. Secretary Panetta expressed his support for child custody legislation but raised concerns about the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act of 2012, stating that it needed a critical revision to prioritize the best interest of the child in custody cases. Secretary Panetta expressed concern about legislation dictating outcomes in court cases, especially when children are involved. He suggested adding \"as the sole factor\" in a bill to preserve flexibility for courts to decide in the child's best interest. The American Bar Association opposes federal child custody legislation. It is unclear where Secretary of Defense Hagel stands on the issue. The American Bar Association opposes federal legislation that would interfere in child custody cases involving servicemembers, urging states to pass laws preventing denial of custody based on military deployment. The National Governors Association opposes federal intervention in military family matters addressed by state law, citing the strain of deployments on families. States have passed legislation to support servicemembers and their children, and work closely with the Department of Defense on custody cases. Congressional intervention is deemed unnecessary. The Adjutants General Association of the United States (AGAUS) opposes federal legislation preempting state family law in domestic relations issues, advocating for existing state laws and court-integrated social services to handle matters involving National Guard and other service members. AGAUS rejects federal jurisdiction in child custody cases and interference in state child-custody matters. The National Military Family Association supports the AGAUS's stance against federal legislation interfering in state child custody matters involving National Guard and other service members. They urge states to enact laws preventing custody changes based solely on military deployment. The National Military Family Association supports state control over child custody matters for service members, opposing federal intervention. They endorse the Uniform Deployed Parents Visitation and Custody Act and advocate for educating judges on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Uniform Law Commission provides standardized legislation for states to address custody issues during military deployment. The Uniform Deployed Parents Visitation and Custody Act (UDPCVA) offers uniform codes for state legislatures to standardize custody rights for deployed military parents. State courts struggle with jurisdiction issues and visitation rights for step-parents or grandparents during deployment. The Uniform Law Commission opposes federal legislation in child custody cases, stating that family law is a state's rights issue. The Uniform Deployed Parents Visitation and Custody Act (UDPCVA) aims to standardize custody rights for deployed military parents. Mr. Fish argues that the federal law would complicate matters, while Representative Turner believes his bill would provide minimum protections for military parents without creating federal jurisdiction. 46 states have passed military child custody legislation in line with these efforts. 46 states have passed military child custody legislation in line with the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act, with exceptions being Alabama, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Mexico. Massachusetts has pending legislation. Congress continues to address the issue until state courts stop using military service as the sole factor in custody hearings. The Senate is cautious about federal involvement, but the future debate may focus on the extent of federal intervention. The debate in Congress may focus on federal involvement in military child custody cases, considering the adequacies of state laws. Legislation will likely prioritize the best interest of the child. H.R. 1898 aims to protect child custody rights of deployed Armed Forces members. The court must reinstate the custody order upon the return of a servicemember from deployment, unless not in the child's best interest. Deployment cannot be the sole factor in determining the child's best interest in custody cases involving servicemembers. Federal jurisdiction or right of action is not created, and state law prevails in child custody proceedings. The section provides higher protection to deploying servicemembers in child custody cases. Deployment is defined as movement for 60-540 days without family. H.R. 1898 and H.R. 4201 are legislative efforts related to military child custody. H.R. 4201 Servicemember Family Protection Act was referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and later reported and passed by the House with overwhelming support. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) was not incorporated in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. The Act aims to provide protection to servicemembers during their military service by temporarily suspending judicial and administrative proceedings that may affect their civil rights. It applies to the United States, states, and territories.

Additionally, the Act prohibits the enforcement of bail bonds during the period of military service and allows for waivers in writing by sureties, guarantors, endorsers, accommodation makers, and other persons. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protection to servicemembers by suspending judicial and administrative proceedings that may affect their civil rights. It allows for waivers in writing by sureties, guarantors, endorsers, accommodation makers, and other persons. Waivers are only valid if executed separately from the obligation or liability. If a waiver is executed by an individual who enters military service, it is not valid during the period of military service. Additionally, citizens serving with allied forces in a war or military action are entitled to the same relief and protections under the Act. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections to servicemembers by suspending proceedings that may affect their civil rights. Reserves and persons ordered to report for military service or induction are entitled to rights and protections under the Act from the date of receipt of the order until reporting for service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections to servicemembers by suspending civil proceedings for induction until the date of reporting. Section 521 of the Act protects servicemembers against default judgments in civil actions, requiring plaintiffs to file an affidavit stating the defendant's military status before entering judgment. If the defendant is in military service, the court must appoint an attorney before proceeding with judgment. The court must appoint an attorney to represent a servicemember before entering judgment if their military status is uncertain. If the defendant is later found to be in military service, a bond may be required to indemnify them against any loss from the judgment. The bond remains in effect until the time for appeal expires. The court may issue orders to protect the defendant's rights under the Act, and false affidavits are subject to penalties. In cases involving a defendant in military service, the court must grant a minimum 90-day stay of proceedings if certain conditions are met. If a default judgment is entered against a servicemember during their military service, the court must reopen the judgment if the servicemember's defense was affected by their military service. The court may issue orders to protect the defendant's rights under the Act, and false affidavits are subject to penalties. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows servicemembers to apply for a stay of proceedings in civil actions if they are in military service or within 90 days after termination of service and have received notice of the action. The application must be filed within 90 days of release from military service. If a default judgment is vacated due to the Act, it does not affect the rights of a bona fide purchaser. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows servicemembers to request a stay of civil proceedings. The court can grant a stay for at least 90 days if certain conditions are met, including providing evidence of how military duties affect their ability to appear. Applying for a stay does not waive any defenses. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows servicemembers to request a stay of civil proceedings based on the impact of military duty. A servicemember can apply for an additional stay if needed, and if refused, the court must appoint counsel. If unsuccessful, the servicemember cannot seek protections under another section of the Act. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows servicemembers to request a stay of civil proceedings based on the impact of military duty. The court may stay execution of judgments, attachments, and garnishments if the servicemember is materially affected by military service. This protection applies during and after military service for up to 90 days. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows courts to order installment payments for the period of military service and 90 days thereafter. Codefendants not in military service can be pursued separately with court approval. This section does not apply to certain other sections of the Act. Additionally, an appendix provides information on state child custody laws related to servicemembers."
