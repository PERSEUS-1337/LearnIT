    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"College Fire Prevention Act\" is cited due to findings of fires at various universities, including one at the University of Connecticut where a fraternity was destroyed with no working fire alarms, a fire at the University of Wisconsin-Madison caused by a candle in a secret room without sprinklers, and a fatal off-campus fire at Allegheny College with no sprinklers and battery-operated smoke detectors. Several fires at universities caused significant damage, including one at Pennsylvania State University displacing 11 students, a fire at DePauw University forcing the evacuation of 116 students, and a fire at Amherst College started by a halogen lamp in student housing. A fire at Amherst College student housing started by a halogen lamp in an unoccupied room. The fire alarm system was activated, and an occupant unsuccessfully tried to extinguish it. Damage was limited to the room of origin. Halogen lamps are banned by the college. In a separate incident at Seton Hall University, a dormitory fire resulted in three student deaths and injuries to many others. The dormitory had smoke alarms but no sprinkler system. Between 1980 and 1998, there were 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, resulting in 1 death, 70 injuries, and $8,000,000 in property damage. The main causes of fires in these buildings are arson, cooking, and smoking. New dormitories are required to have fire sprinklers, but existing buildings are not retroactively required to have them. In 1998, 93% of campus building fires with smoke alarms had occurred, but only 34% had fire sprinklers. Existing buildings are not retroactively required to have fire sprinklers. Establishment of Fire Suppression Demonstration Incentive Program. The Secretary of Education will establish a program to award grants for installing fire suppression technologies in student housing owned by eligible entities, including accredited institutions of higher education and historically Black colleges. The Secretary of Education will prioritize grants for eligible entities with the greatest financial need, including historically Black colleges, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges, and social fraternities or sororities with tax-exempt status. Eligible entities must demonstrate financial need to apply for grants under this program. To apply for a grant under this program, eligible entities must submit an application with required information. A matching requirement of at least 50% non-Federal funds is necessary for grant receipt. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the grant amount. The Secretary must report on the entities receiving assistance, funding sources, and program progress annually. The curr_chunk provides details on the financial information, types of fire suppression technologies, and identification of policies that may hinder the program's effectiveness. It also authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 to carry out the program. At the end of fiscal year 2009, unobligated appropriations revert to the Treasury's general fund. SEC. 3. ADMISSIBILITY AS EVIDENCE. Prohibition on using application for assistance under this Act as evidence in any proceeding, with exception for enforcement of agreements with eligible entities."
