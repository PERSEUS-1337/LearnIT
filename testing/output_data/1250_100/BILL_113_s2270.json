The Board of Governors, in consultation with State insurance regulators, determines capital requirements for regulated insurance entities in specific foreign jurisdictions. This includes actions related to insurance provision by persons regulated by State insurance regulators or regulated foreign subsidiaries/affiliates. The minimum leverage capital requirements and risk-based capital requirements for depository institution holding companies or nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors do not need to include regulated insurance entities for consolidation purposes. The subsection does not limit the Board of Governors' authority to issue regulations on capital requirements for depository institution holding companies or nonbank financial companies. It also clarifies that depository institution holding companies or nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors, regulated by State insurance regulators, and engaged in the business of insurance, must follow specific accounting principles. Insurance Commissioners must adhere to Statutory Accounting Principles as per State law and are not required by the Board to prepare financial statements based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This does not limit the Board's authority to conduct regulatory activities for depository institution holding companies or non-bank financial companies. The Board must still comply with relevant laws such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
