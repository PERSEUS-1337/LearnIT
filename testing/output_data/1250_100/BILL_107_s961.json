    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The findings section highlights the lack of a patient registry for breast implant recipients, estimates on the number of women with breast implants, adverse reaction reports for silicone and saline implants, the need for complete information on health risks, and the fact that silicone breast implants have never been approved. Silicone breast implants have never been approved by the FDA; saline implants were approved in 2000 despite high complication rates. 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications after three years. In 1998, a criminal investigation was opened regarding manipulation of research data by a breast implant manufacturer. The FDA panel considering saline implant approval in 2000 was not informed of this investigation. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000, but investigations into complications remain open. Studies have shown high rates of additional surgeries and ruptured implants, with silicone migration and unknown health implications. Research also found a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with implants. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study on silicone breast implant safety highlighted local complications as the primary issue, with concerns about undefined connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found higher rates of lung and brain cancer in breast implant recipients. Silicone migration was reported in women with ruptured implants in a 1999 case study. Silicone breast implants can lead to severe local inflammation and complications from silicone migration. Studies show that implants can hinder accurate mammograms, delaying breast cancer detection. Breastfeeding women with implants should be cautious as silicone may pass into breast milk with unknown effects. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants, ensure women receive accurate information, and urge the FDA to conclude its investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by implant manufacturers. This Act does not affect existing regulations on silicone breast implants for reconstruction, correction of deformities, or replacement for ruptured implants. The National Institutes of Health will provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act will include a new section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, involving various Institutes. Study sections are established to review research grant applications on breast implants. The Director of NIH conducts research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study on women with implants for at least eight years. The study focuses on complications like capsular contracture, leakage, and neurological dysfunction. The Director of NIH conducts research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, focusing on complications like capsular contracture, leakage, and neurological dysfunction. The study aims to evaluate the health differences, if any, between women with implants and suitable controls. The Director prepares an annual report for Congress on the study results. The FDA will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. The Commissioner will update Congress on the implementation status regularly. Additionally, activities regarding silicone breast implants will be expanded and intensified at the FDA. To ensure accurate information on silicone breast implants, the FDA will expedite investigations, update consumer information, and require manufacturers to regularly update package inserts with relevant data. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants conducting clinical studies to provide patients with important information, including the FDA's breast implant booklet, informed consent documents, and guidance on reporting any issues. The FDA mandates manufacturers of silicone breast implants to provide patients with essential information, including the FDA's booklet, informed consent, and reporting guidance. Additionally, a special panel is appointed annually to review breast implant information and ads for accuracy, with members including implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists."
