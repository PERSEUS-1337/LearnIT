    "content": "This report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. Tactical aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and defense spending. The current focus is on three aircraft acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the Air Force F-22 fighter, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. Congress faces decisions in FY2010 regarding these programs, such as whether to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35, end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, and approve Navy's funding request for nine aircraft in FY2010. The report discusses FY2010 legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft, including the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. Key issues include affordability of DOD's modernization plans and the future of the U.S. industrial base for tactical aircraft. Tactical aircraft refer to combat planes with shorter ranges. Tactical aircraft, also known as theater aircraft, operate within a regional theater of operations. In contrast, strategic aircraft like B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are designed for long-range missions, including intercontinental flights. Tactical aircraft, primarily fighters and strike fighters, are used for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. Tactical aircraft, including F-35 and F/A-18E/F, are dual-role planes designed for air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. They operate from land bases or aircraft carriers and are used for air superiority and air-to-ground combat missions. Marine Corps aircraft can operate from Navy ships and land bases, with some being VSTOL or STOVL aircraft. Tactical aircraft engage in air-to-air combat and provide close air support and battlefield air interdiction. The Air Force and Navy operate various tactical aircraft for air-to-air and air-to-ground operations, including F-22, F-15, F-16, A-10, and F/A-18A-F. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D and AV-8B VSTOL aircraft. In early 2009, the DOD had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft in its inventory. In 2009, the U.S. had around 3,500 tactical aircraft, with 2,375 in the Air Force and 1,125 in the Navy and Marine Corps. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 fighter, and F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. The F-35 program aims to provide a cost-effective fifth-generation strike fighter for all three services, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The F-35 program, with a cost of $246 billion in FY2009 dollars, includes the procurement of F-35A for the Air Force, F-35B for the Marine Corps, and F-35C for the Navy. The F-22 fighter is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The F-22 fighter features thrust-vectoring for high maneuverability and integrated avionics. Procurement of F-22s began in FY1999, with a total of 187 aircraft procured through FY2009. The administration plans to halt procurement at 187, with no funding requested for additional F-22s in FY2010. Supporters aim for 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter, considered a fourth-generation aircraft with some fifth-generation technology. Hornets and Super Hornets are key components of the Navy's aircraft carrier air wings. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some observers question the projections, suggesting they are influenced by military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual warfighting needs. The peak size of the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on assumptions about service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan on May 18, 2009, to retire older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, in order to generate savings for other program needs. Approximately 250 aircraft would be retired, excluding five fighters previously scheduled for retirement in FY10. The plan aims to fund a smaller and more capable force for higher priority missions. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan in 2009 to retire older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. Approximately 250 aircraft would be retired, excluding five fighters previously scheduled for retirement in FY10. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley stated that by accepting short-term risk, they can convert legacy fighters and F-22s into a smaller, more flexible, and lethal bridge to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years would be used to reduce capability gaps and invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters and bombers, as well as procuring munitions for joint warfighters. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan in 2009 to retire older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This major step was taken after a careful assessment of the current threat environment and capabilities. The plan includes reassigning manpower to emerging missions like surveillance operations and nuclear deterrence. It involves expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 Stratofortress squadron, and enhancing combatant commander support in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Air Force is committed to initiatives to strengthen its nuclear enterprise and deploy 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. Secretary Donley emphasizes the need for a force mix that meets current and future mission requirements. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing tactical aircraft, with predictions of a budget \"train wreck\" due to insufficient funding. The issue was previously focused on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production winds down, it may shift to other programs. In the coming years, the affordability of the F-35 program will be a key issue as DOD aims to increase procurement rates. DOD has reduced the number of new aircraft acquired since the 1990s, mainly due to post-Cold War reductions in Air Force and Navy air wings. The Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan and the F-35 program are major initiatives to limit tactical aircraft modernization costs. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft through acquiring a versatile strike fighter. However, the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan is uncertain, especially with potential budget constraints. The projected fighter shortfalls for the Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps highlight ongoing challenges in funding tactical aircraft modernization, potentially leading to tradeoffs between funding for aircraft acquisition programs and other defense systems. Funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs compared to funding for non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. Some argue for more emphasis on long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities. Additionally, funding for tactical aircraft versus other aircraft for different missions like airlift, electronic warfare, and surveillance aircraft. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft is a concern amidst potential budget constraints. DOD plans to prioritize funding for UAVs and UCAVs over traditional tactical aircraft in the coming years to enhance capabilities for irregular warfare operations. This shift in focus raises concerns about the affordability of DOD's modernization plans for all types of aircraft. Observers debate the relative capabilities and costs of land-based Air Force aircraft (F-22, F-35A) versus sea-based Navy and Marine Corps aircraft (F/A-18E/F, F-35B/C) for various missions. The administration's proposal to prioritize funding for one land-based tactical aircraft (F-35A) over another (F-22) and one sea-based tactical aircraft (F-35B/C) over another (F/A-18E/F) raises questions about comparative costs and capabilities. Potential tradeoffs include upgrading older-design tactical aircraft like F-15s and F-16s instead of procuring new models, or extending the service life of existing aircraft. Each tradeoff poses complex questions of costs and capabilities. The debate over U.S. military goals and objectives, particularly in the context of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), involves weighing the emphasis on irregular warfare operations versus conventional interstate conflict. Some question the need for large quantities of high-capability tactical aircraft, arguing they may not be the most cost-effective for current military operations. This debate influences decisions on procurement and operation of tactical aircraft. Some argue for reducing procurement of high-capability tactical aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and training forward air controllers due to changing military needs. Concerns remain about potential adversaries acquiring advanced aircraft and surface-to-air missiles, necessitating a continued need for high-capability tactical aircraft. Recent acquisitions by China and India raise concerns about future challenges to U.S. airpower. Representative Neil Abercrombie has requested a review of military goals and objectives in light of these developments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for tactical fighter and attack aircraft. The military services plan to spend $109.3 billion on 570 new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changing requirements have reduced procurement quantities. The F-22A development period doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has declined. Similar issues are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), crucial for future modernization efforts. Its development costs have increased. The development costs of operational systems have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, with procurement and delivery schedules slipping. Legacy aircraft must be sustained until new systems are ready to replace them, requiring more funding. Uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries makes planning and implementing modernization efforts challenging. The services are investing an average of $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but there are large unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. The Department of Defense lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in assessing capability gaps and duplication. Each military service operates independently to acquire resources for their specific force structures. Current aircraft delivery has been below expectations, and future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels. Service plans rely on optimistic assumptions about costs, quantities, and funding levels. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Department of Defense (DOD) take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing and delivering new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated enterprise-level investment strategy for tactical air forces. This is in response to the lack of a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in assessing capability gaps and duplication within the military services. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2009 plans. The study compares seven alternative approaches for modernizing the fighter forces, including maintaining inventory requirements, reducing aircraft while maintaining weapons capacity, and replacing portions of the fighter force with longer-range aircraft. The report highlights the potential increase in capability with modernization efforts, stating that inventories would remain stable but fleets would be equipped with state-of-the-art aircraft. The modernized fleets will have advanced aircraft with increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities, enhancing survivability. Despite emphasis on greater flight endurance, the unrefueled ranges of newer aircraft may not increase significantly. Fighter inventories are projected to fall below goals, but aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to enhanced lethality and survivability. Alternative approaches like purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could provide short-term inventory relief. The potential acquisition of older design aircraft could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings, with some capability trade-offs compared to purchasing JSFs. A mix of fighters and attack aircraft would enhance basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft could maintain air-to-ground weapons capacities at similar costs, but with fewer aircraft for air-to-air combat. Congressional decisions on tactical aircraft programs could impact the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. The U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry employs thousands of workers and decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact industry structure. Currently, there are two prime contractors, Lockheed and Boeing, but this may reduce to one in the future. Concerns have been raised about potential lack of competition affecting innovation, prices, and production quality. Congress may need to consider how many prime contractors are necessary to support future military needs. Many tactical aircraft prime contractors are needed to support U.S. military needs in the future. The value of competition at the prime contractor level in the development and procurement of tactical aircraft is crucial. The potential for Boeing to use its expertise in designing and building aircraft to compete effectively against Lockheed for future contracts is important. Decisions on tactical aircraft programs can impact U.S. export earnings and the international competitiveness of the aerospace industry. Legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization is discussed, including a requirement for DOD to report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft. The provision requires the Secretary of Defense to report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement, including the number needed, estimated costs, savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of procurement methods. The provision requires the Secretary of Defense to report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement, including the availability and feasibility of F-35s in fiscal years 2015 through fiscal year 2025, recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, and certifications needed if such authorization is recommended. The term '4.5 generation fighter aircraft' refers to current fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities and the ability to deploy advanced armaments. The committee expects detailed analyses on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, specifically focusing on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft as part of combat air forces restructuring. The Air Force is prohibited from retiring fighter aircraft as part of the combat air forces restructuring plan until a report is submitted to Congress. This includes a prohibition on personnel reassignments and a requirement to continue funding for operations and maintenance. The Air Force is required to submit a report to Congress before retiring fighter aircraft as part of the combat air forces restructuring plan. Funding must continue for operations and maintenance, with specific allocations for modifications to sustain the aircraft. The report must detail plans to address force structure and capability gaps, assess the threat environment, outline mission assignments for affected bases, explain criteria for base and fighter selection, describe environmental analyses, and identify personnel reassignments and authorizations. The Air Force must submit a report to Congress before retiring fighter aircraft as part of the combat air forces restructuring plan. The report should include funding needs for operations, maintenance, personnel, and aircraft procurement. It should also estimate cost avoidance and describe how funds would be invested to modernize the remaining fighter force. The prohibition on retiring certain aircraft does not apply to five fighters scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Congress expresses its findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure in Section 1051. Congress finds that the Navy must maintain at least 10 carrier air wings, each with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft, in addition to other forces. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation aircraft, most strike fighters in carrier air wings will not be fifth-generation assets. Congress urges the Secretary of the Navy to allocate resources to ensure the required number of strike fighter aircraft in each wing. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. They fear this could create gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available. Additionally, the committee is worried about the lack of identified follow-on missions for affected bases and has identified $143.7 million in unjustified program growth in the Air Force's budget. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, fearing gaps in force structure and capability. They have identified $200.9 million in unexecutable peacetime operations and recommend using $344.6 million for the continued operation and maintenance of these fighters. The committee notes a projected shortfall of 800 fighter aircraft by 2024. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, fearing gaps in force structure and capability. They have identified a projected shortfall of 800 fighter aircraft by 2024. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report addressing the \"fighter gap\" issue with alternative solutions by March 1, 2010. The report highlights concerns about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include reductions in F/A-18A through D inventory and delays in the F-35B/C program development. The committee is concerned about the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with potential peak shortages of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors include reductions in F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in F-35B/C program development, and the need for additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the shortfall. The committee supports procurement of more F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract as a cost-effective solution. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft. It also expresses Congress's sense that the Navy should maintain at least ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. The committee directs a report evaluating extending the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft versus procuring more F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report highlights concerns about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The committee is concerned about the Navy's aircraft inventory shortfall as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C is available. The Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, increasing to 125 when Marine Corps requirements are included. The committee questions the basis of this projection. The Chief of Naval Operations stated a potential gap of 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. The committee is concerned about the Navy's failure to address the increased shortfall in its tactical air fleet, which poses a risk to national security. The delay in action raises concerns about security risks, reliance on costly programs for legacy aircraft, and lack of realistic procurement plans to address the shortfall. The committee is concerned about the Navy's plans to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall, including extending the life of select legacy F/A-18's through a costly Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). There are uncertainties about the effectiveness and cost of this plan, with doubts about how many planes can reach the extended flight hours. The committee believes that procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multiyear procurement strategy may be more cost-efficient compared to the risks and uncertainties of the SLEP. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements versus investing in a SLEP of legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities over legacy F/A-18's, increasing the benefit of purchasing new aircraft. The Navy projects F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040. The committee expects the Department of Defense to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. They anticipate the analysis of multiyear procurement for the F/A-18 to include cost differentials and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. The Department's tactical aviation procurement strategies should be informed by the Quadrennial Defense Review, especially considering the significant strike-fighter shortfall. The H.R. 2647 version contains a provision requiring the Department of Defense to report on the procurement of 4.5-generation fighter aircraft. It also mandates reports on force structure findings and prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft without submitting a report on the combat air forces restructuring plan. Congress also expresses its views on Navy carrier air wing force structure. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including the number needed, estimated costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of procurement methods. The Secretary of Defense is required to report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including advanced capabilities and armaments, as well as the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. SEC. 1075 of the report addresses Combat Air Forces restructuring, prohibiting the retirement of fighter aircraft and personnel reassignments until a report is submitted to Congress. The report on Combat Air Forces restructuring must include a detailed plan to address force structure and capability gaps, assessment of threat environment and capabilities, follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, funding needs for fiscal years 2010-2015, cost avoidance estimates, and investment plans. The report on Combat Air Forces restructuring must include a detailed plan for investing funds in the future-years defense plan to ensure the fighter force remains modernized and effective. The sense of Congress is that the Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, in addition to the required 11 operational aircraft carriers. The Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should ensure this requirement is met until modifications to the carrier air wing force structure are justified. The Air Force's investment strategy aims to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force, with potential procurement of additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract. The conferees intend for the Air Force to analyze the potential for procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract, specifically the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities, and submit a proposal to Congress if conditions under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code are met. This provision does not alter the requirements of Section 2306b and is separate from previous legislation. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided by the Air Force regarding its Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy aircraft. They directed that reports be transmitted to the Defense Appropriations Committees and questioned the premature implementation of the plan, citing personnel and acquisition costs associated with removing F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base. The Committee directs the Department to provide a cost benefit analysis of removing F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon. The report will analyze factors impacting training quantity and quality, identify where specific training programs will be established, assess simulator and ancillary training access, and consider future military construction requirements. Additionally, the Department is requested to identify airfields that share runways for both Air Force and commercial operations within the continental United States. The Committee requests a cost benefit analysis of removing F-15 pilot training from certain Air Force bases and an independent review on the impact of the restructure on combat air forces. The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo aging the F-18 aircraft faster than planned for the F-35 Lightning II introduction. The Navy is facing critical shortfalls in its strike fighter inventory, with the shortfall now over 200 aircraft due to delays in the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II. The life extension of older F-18 aircraft is proving problematic, and the reduction in F-18 purchases is moving the tactical aircraft inventory in the opposite direction of what is needed. Fortunately, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft is still open. The production line for the F/A-18E/F variant aircraft is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The Navy is urged to consider another multi-year procurement strategy to save money and mitigate the strike fighter shortfall. The recommendation includes funding for long lead equipment and additional aircraft procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $495,000,000 for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18E/F Aircraft to address the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. Concerns were raised about the aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. An increase of $512,280,000 was provided to procure more F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010, with a recommendation for a multi-year procurement contract. The Senate also approved an amendment prohibiting the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft. An amendment (S.Amdt. 2596) prohibits the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft as announced in the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan until a detailed plan for filling the capability gaps is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Air Force's proposed combat air forces restructuring plan includes details on the retirement of tactical aircraft, follow-on missions for affected bases, criteria for base and aircraft selection, personnel reassignment, cost avoidance estimates, and fund investment plans."
