States receive this funding through various means like grants, loans, and direct appropriations. It is important for taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to have access to objective data to compare performance and costs effectively. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings using total accountability measures, including unit-cost data. This will show which States are most effective with taxpayer dollars and promote competition among States to be more efficient with tax dollars. States with lower activity costs will serve as models for others to ensure accountability and value for taxpayers. State governments receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15 days before the end of the Federal fiscal year. The report includes a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary. The Director will publish these reports on their website within 30 days. Additionally, the Act aims to standardize State fiscal accounting reports to improve government accountability and promote efficiency in the use of taxpayer dollars. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison purposes. States must submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A classification system will be established based on program descriptions and relevant data. The Director will identify agency activities and their corresponding activity units. Performance measures will be established for each agency activity and linked electronically in reports. The unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government must be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE. This section requires a statement to identify all sources of funds available for expenditure by the budget entity, including State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other sources determined appropriate by the Director. The line item listing for an agency activity must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. It should also describe conduct for activity units, purposes of the activity, and intended beneficiaries. The Director may allocate expenditures for agency activities without measurement methods to similar activities with established methods. Total funds expended by a budget entity must include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. Unit-cost for agency activities is determined by a specific formula. The formula in paragraph (2) defines UC as the unit-cost of the agency activity, m as the amount in subsection (a)(1)(B), and q as the number in subsection (a)(1)(C). Section 8 outlines the reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures, identifying and explaining any differences between adjusted expenditures and total funds available for expenditure by the budget entity. Adjusted expenditures are determined by a specific formula. The formula in paragraph (2) defines adjusted expenditures (AE) as the sum of all expenditures (EXP) for agency activities, pass-throughs (PT), and reversions (REV). A budget entity can identify pass-throughs and reversions based on criteria set by the Director. Noncompliance may result in withholding 10% of Federal financial assistance. Rules are outlined in Section 10. The Director is authorized to make rules necessary for this Act. Definitions include State government, budget entity, agency activity, and Federal financial assistance."
