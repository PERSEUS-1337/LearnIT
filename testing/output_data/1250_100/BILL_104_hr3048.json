    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\". Judicial review is addressed in the Act. The \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\" addresses judicial review, allowing affected small entities to petition for review of a final rule's economic impact certification or regulatory flexibility analysis within one year of its issuance. A court with jurisdiction over rule compliance can review the certification or analysis. The analysis is made public. The term 'affected small entity' refers to a small entity negatively impacted by the final rule. Courts can still delay the rule's effective date. If a court finds the agency's certification arbitrary, it can order a final regulatory flexibility analysis. If the agency's analysis was not done correctly, the court can order corrective action. The court may stay a rule if the agency fails to comply with section 604 requirements within 90 days. The court must consider prejudicial error when granting relief. Regulatory flexibility analysis is part of the record for judicial review of a rule. Judicial review of impact statements required by other laws is not barred. The amendment made by this law applies only to final agency rules issued after the date of enactment. SEC. 3. RULES COMMENTED ON BY SBA CHIEF COUNSEL FOR ADVOCACY.

Agencies must publish this statement and their response in the Federal Register when issuing general notice of proposed rulemaking.
