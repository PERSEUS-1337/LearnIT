In response, Canada, China, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey retaliated with tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products. India also proposed retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. goods, while China targeted over 800 U.S. agricultural and food products in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. Retaliatory tariffs from trading partners have targeted over 800 U.S. agricultural and food products, amounting to $26.9 billion in exports in 2017. Various factors affect agricultural exports, including tariff rates, production, market prices, exchange rates, and economic growth. The USDA forecasts a decrease in total U.S. agricultural exports for FY2019, mainly due to reduced soybean and cotton exports. A study from Purdue University suggests that U.S. agricultural exports could decrease by $8 billion after adjusting to retaliatory tariffs. The study projects a reduction in U.S. agricultural exports due to retaliatory tariffs, potentially leading to lower land prices and job reallocation. Soybean producers are expected to be most affected, with exports possibly falling by 21% and land prices by 18%. The retaliating trade partners target U.S. agricultural and food products due to the country's significant exports and alternative sources available from other exporting countries. China, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay are major soybean exporters. Canada, China, Mexico, and the EU are key markets for U.S. agricultural exports. China has imposed tariffs on most U.S. agricultural imports in response to U.S. tariffs. Other countries like Turkey, Canada, and Mexico have also levied tariffs on U.S. products. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. food and agricultural products, including grains, meat, fruits, vegetables, seafood, and processed foods, totaling about $20.6 billion in imports from the U.S. in 2017. This action came in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. In a meeting on December 1, 2018, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day halt on escalating trade tensions, delaying further U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. In response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. food and agricultural products. However, as part of an agreement, China committed to purchasing significant quantities of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans. The USDA reported multiple soybean sales to China in December 2018, marking the first sales since the tariffs were implemented. The forecast for U.S. agricultural and food exports to China in FY2019 is a decline to $9 billion from $16.3 billion in FY2018 and $21.8 billion in FY2017 due to trade tensions. Canada, the leading export market for U.S. agricultural and food products in 2017, has imposed retaliatory tariffs on over 20 U.S. agricultural and food products. The duty-free status of processed food items under NAFTA has been revoked, leading to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico. U.S. exports of affected products to Canada were valued at $2.6 billion in 2017, with key items like roasted coffee, ketchup, and orange juice being heavily impacted. Despite the tariffs, USDA projects an increase in agricultural and food exports to Canada by $1 billion in FY2019. Mexico has also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, with exports subject to tariffs amounting to approximately $2.5 billion in 2017. In 2017, Mexico was the top export market for U.S. cheese and the second-leading market for U.S. pork. Despite retaliatory tariffs, U.S. exports of pork, cheese, and other products to Mexico declined. However, USDA projects an increase in total U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico in FY2019 by $900 million. The EU imposed a 25% tariff on some U.S. exports, including whiskey, totaling $1 billion of the $13.2 billion of total U.S. agricultural and food exports to the EU in 2017. U.S. whiskey exports to the EU were the most affected, amounting to $667 million in 2017. The EU imposed a 25% tariff on U.S. whiskey, kidney beans, and cranberry juice, affecting exports. Despite the tariffs, USDA projects an increase in overall U.S. agricultural and food exports to the EU in FY2019. Turkey has retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. exports, including tree nuts, rice, prepared foods, whiskey, and tobacco. In response to retaliatory tariffs, U.S. agricultural exports to Turkey and India are affected. Turkey's tariffs impact tree nuts, rice, prepared foods, whiskey, and tobacco. U.S. unshelled walnut exports to Turkey accounted for 23% of total U.S. exports in 2017. India threatens tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, including almonds, valued at $857 million in 2017. Almond growers could be impacted if the tariffs are imposed. India plans to increase tariffs on U.S. unshelled almonds by 20%, affecting a significant portion of U.S. exports. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans, with a total tariff rate of 27%. This has led to limited access to key export markets for products like pork, soybeans, cheese, and whiskey. China imposed a 27% tariff on U.S. soybeans, significantly reducing exports to China, the largest buyer. This led to a 63% decrease in U.S. soybean exports from January to October 2018 compared to 2017. The price of U.S. soybeans dropped due to the tariffs, impacting farmers' income. The American Soybean Association (ASA) expressed disappointment at escalating tariffs on imports from China, leading to China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. Despite increased exports to other markets like the EU, Mexico, and Egypt, total U.S. soybean exports in FY2019 are projected to decline by $800 million. USDA forecasts an average farm price of soybeans at $7.35-$9.85 per bushel for the 2018/2019 marketing year, down from $9.33 per bushel in 2017/2018. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. sorghum have also impacted trade. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. sorghum and pork, affecting a significant portion of U.S. exports. The tariffs on sorghum have raised the total rate to 27%, impacting a market that previously absorbed 80% of U.S. sorghum exports. U.S. sorghum exports to China were valued at $836 million in 2017, but are forecasted to decline to $500 million in FY2019. Similarly, Mexico and China have levied tariffs on U.S. pork, potentially impacting up to 30% of U.S. pork exports by value. Mexico and China are key markets for U.S. pork exports, with China subjecting some U.S. pork to an additional 25% retaliatory tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Chinese tariffs on U.S. pork products, including bone-in hams, have reached 70%, leading to a decline in exports to both Mexico and China. U.S. pork exports to Mexico, previously duty-free under NAFTA, now face a 20% tariff. The value of U.S. pork exports to Mexico and China has decreased, with frozen edible pork offal being a significant export to China. The retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and Mexico also affect U.S. cheese exports, impacting nearly one-third of total U.S. cheese exports by value. In response to the Trump Administration's trade actions, Mexico and China imposed tariffs on U.S. cheese exports. Mexico replaced its zero duty on U.S. cheese with tariffs of 20% and 25%, affecting $390 million worth of cheese exports in 2017. China applied a 25% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. cheese types, leading to a decline in cheese exports to both countries. The value of U.S. cheese exports to Mexico and China decreased by 7% and 51% respectively between July and October 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. In 2017, U.S. apple exports to Mexico and China faced additional retaliatory tariffs of 20% and 40%, respectively, increasing total tariff rates to 20% and 50%. These two countries accounted for 30% of total U.S. apple exports in 2017. Mexico was the top export market for U.S. fresh apples, importing $275 million in 2017. China, a potential growth market, imported $18 million worth of U.S. apples in 2017. India ranked third, purchasing $97 million of U.S. apples. India plans to impose a 30% retaliatory tariff on U.S. apples in 2019. China also imposed a 40% retaliatory tariff on U.S. cherries, raising the total tariff rate to 50%. In 2017, U.S. cherry exports to China increased by 68%, accounting for 19% of total U.S. cherry exports. However, the retaliatory tariff imposed by China led to a 19% decrease in U.S. cherry exports in FY2018. China also imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on U.S. seafood, affecting $1.2 billion worth of exports. The retaliatory tariffs have impacted niche agricultural products like American Ginseng as well. China has imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on U.S. American Ginseng, which heavily relies on export sales to China. In 2017, China purchased 60% of U.S. American Ginseng exports, valued at $22 million. The tariffs could harm the industry as China may turn to Canadian suppliers. U.S. whiskey is also facing retaliatory tariffs from various trade partners, including the EU, China, Turkey, and Canada, impacting a significant portion of U.S. whiskey exports. The U.S. faces retaliatory tariffs from various countries, with Mexico imposing a 25% tariff on bourbon whiskey, Canada applying a 10% tariff, and U.S. food exports being targeted as well. U.S. whiskey exports to retaliating countries totaled $742 million in 2017, accounting for 66% of total U.S. whiskey exports. Canada's tariffs on processed foods could significantly impact U.S. food manufacturers. In response, the USDA announced a $12 billion trade aid package to assist farmers affected by the tariffs. The USDA announced a $12 billion trade aid package to assist farmers affected by retaliatory tariffs. The package includes payments for corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum, wheat, hogs, dairy, fresh sweet cherries, and shelled almonds, with soybean producers receiving the majority of direct payments. Additionally, funds will be used to purchase excess supplies of 29 different commodities and for trade promotion efforts. Many agricultural groups are concerned about retaliatory tariffs affecting U.S. farm income from exports. The EU and Mexico have finalized trade agreements that could increase competition for U.S. agricultural exports. The American Soybean Association (ASA) is disappointed with escalating tariffs on China leading to retaliatory measures. The NPPC and U.S. Dairy Export Council express concern over retaliatory tariffs from China and Mexico, threatening U.S. farmers. Farmers for Free Trade opposes tariffs harming agriculture and runs ads to raise awareness. The USDA's trade aid package aims to alleviate the impact of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, but some producer groups find it inadequate. Several producer groups find the trade aid package insufficient to compensate for lost export sales due to retaliatory tariffs. The American Farm Bureau Federation believes the package offers only temporary relief, while farmer and rancher organizations urge the Administration to address trade concerns causing tariff retaliation. Many farmers are likely to suffer from lower prices and lost market opportunities. The USDA's aid package is seen as a limited solution to mitigate export losses. Some agriculture industry stakeholders believe that the retaliatory tariffs could have longer-lasting effects due to uncertainty about U.S. trade policy behavior and reliability as a trading partner. Several bills introduced in Congress aimed to provide more export promotion money and adjustment assistance to affected farmers, but none passed. Legislation like S. 3258 and H.R. 6483 would have offered trade adjustment assistance to farmers impacted by reduced exports from retaliatory tariffs. Legislation such as H.R. 6699 proposed that duties from Section 232 or Section 301 tariffs on U.S. imports be allocated to agricultural programs. Members of Congress may engage with the Administration to boost agricultural sales in domestic and export markets, supporting the long-term economic health of U.S. food and agricultural interests."
