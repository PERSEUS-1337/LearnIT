    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act\". The increasingly litigious nature of the legal profession in the United States has created barriers for individuals to help others. Lawsuits, excessive damage awards, and unfair liability allocations hinder volunteerism and charitable service. Arbitrary damage awards contribute to high liability insurance costs for volunteers and organizations, making it difficult to be protected. Volunteer service organizations in the United States are suffering due to volunteers avoiding participation because of fears of lawsuits. This decline in volunteerism is impacting essential services such as crisis counseling, rescue services, sports coaching, and support for the elderly. Federal legislation is needed to clarify and limit personal liability risks for volunteers, as the national scope of the issue and dependence on social programs require action. The Federal Government aims to support volunteer service organizations by protecting volunteers from personal financial liability through liability reform. This reform is necessary to ensure the continued operation of essential social programs that rely on volunteers.
