    "content": "A state may apply to waive certain ACA provisions for plan years starting in 2017, including sections related to qualified health plans, health insurance exchanges, cost-sharing reductions, premium tax credits, employer mandate, and individual mandate. The state can apply to waive various ACA provisions for plan years starting in 2017, including requirements for health plans to be certified as QHPs, essential health benefits, limitations on cost sharing, and eligibility for catastrophic health plans. The Secretary of HHS reviews and grants waiver requests for provisions not in the IRC, while the Secretary of the Treasury reviews requests for provisions in the IRC such as premium tax credits and employer and individual mandates. The waiver application is assessed to ensure the state's plan meets coverage and affordability requirements. The state can apply for a waiver to waive certain ACA provisions for plan years starting in 2017. The Secretary of HHS reviews and grants waiver requests for provisions not in the IRC, while the Secretary of the Treasury reviews requests for provisions in the IRC. The state's plan must meet requirements related to coverage, affordability, comprehensiveness, and federal-deficit neutrality to be granted a state innovation waiver. The Secretaries will consider favorably waivers that provide increased access to affordable private market coverage, encourage sustainable spending growth, foster state innovation, support those in need, and promote consumer-driven healthcare. The innovation waiver application process does not consider changes to Medicaid or CHIP that require approval outside of the waiver process. Savings from Medicaid or CHIP changes are not factored into determining deficit-neutrality. Updated guidance in October 2018 allows for some FFE variation, such as states creating their own website while incorporating CMS's enrollment functionalities. States are responsible for funding all FFE modifications and associated operational support, with costs not considered for deficit neutrality. HHS and the Treasury have limitations on federal operational considerations for waivers, with the IRS generally unable to accommodate state-specific changes to tax rules. Small changes to federal tax provisions may be possible if they align with the IRS's current capabilities. States seeking a state innovation waiver must enact a law allowing them to implement the waiver before applying. Public notice, comment periods, and hearings are required before submitting the application to the Secretary of HHS, who then forwards it to the Secretary of the Treasury for review. The Secretary reviews a state's application to determine completeness, including required materials like state legislation, plan description, and analyses. Incomplete applications are notified for missing elements submission. Once deemed complete, the application is made public for review. Final decision must be made within 180 days. Approved waivers can lead to federal funding for the state. A state can receive federal funding under an approved waiver, known as a state innovation waiver. This could result in residents not receiving certain tax credits. Pass-through funding is provided to the state to make up for these lost subsidies. The amount is determined annually and can be used for implementing the waiver plan. Waivers cannot exceed five years unless extended. Requests for extension must be approved within 90 days. The Secretaries must develop a process for coordinating state innovation waivers and other health care waivers under federal law. States can submit a single application for multiple waivers, which will be assessed independently. 14 states have submitted applications for state innovation waivers. As of the date of this report, 14 states have applied for state innovation waivers, with eight applications approved by HHS and the Treasury. Waivers were approved for Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Wisconsin, mostly for implementing individual market reinsurance programs. Massachusetts, Ohio, and Vermont had incomplete applications, while California, Iowa, and Oklahoma withdrew their applications."
