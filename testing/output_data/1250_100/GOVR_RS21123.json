    "content": "\"Normal trade relations\" (NTR) or \"most-favored-nation\" (MFN) status ensures equal treatment in trade. Only Cuba and North Korea lack NTR status with the US, leading to higher import duties. The Trade Act of 1974 restricts NTR status for communist countries, except Poland and Yugoslavia. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies NTR status and US credit to countries restricting emigration. Compliance can lift these restrictions. The Jackson-Vanik amendment allows the President to determine a country's compliance with freedom-of-emigration conditions, which can lead to the removal of trade restrictions. The President can waive these requirements if it promotes freedom of emigration, subject to annual renewal and congressional disapproval. NTR status requires a bilateral agreement and congressional approval before going into effect. The United States and the Soviet Union signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1990, which was later applied to U.S.-Russian trade relations. Russia has received NTR status since 1994, with presidential extensions facing little congressional opposition. Russian leaders have pushed for Russia to be \"graduated\" from Jackson-Vanik coverage, arguing that it is outdated and unnecessary due to their implementation of freedom-of-emigration policies. The United States granted permanent and unconditional NTR status to Ukraine in 2006, which greatly irked Russian leaders. Legislation was passed in 2012 to extend PNTR to Russia, removing the application of the Jackson-Vanik conditions. During the Cold War, U.S.-Soviet economic ties were limited by national security restrictions and Soviet economic policies. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian leaders have been dismantling central economic planning, liberalizing foreign trade and investment. U.S.-Russian economic relations have expanded, with U.S. imports from Russia growing significantly due to higher world prices of oil and natural resources. U.S. exports to Russia include meat, machinery parts, and aircraft parts. Trade between the two countries saw a substantial decline in 2009 due to the global financial crisis but increased in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, U.S. exports to and imports from Russia increased. The top import categories were precious stones, metals, chemicals, fuels, aluminum, iron, and seafood. U.S. exports to Russia mainly included aircraft, machinery parts, and meat. Russia's treatment of U.S. meat imports is a sensitive issue due to its uncompetitive agricultural sector. The rise in Russian incomes has led to an increased demand for meat in the Russian diet, with U.S. producers, especially of poultry, becoming major sources of meat to the Russian market. In 2009, Russia was the largest market for U.S. poultry meat exports. However, new regulations on imports of poultry in 2010 halted U.S. exports to Russia due to concerns over the chlorine wash used by U.S. producers. After discussions between U.S. and Russian officials, the dispute was resolved in 2010, and U.S. shipments of poultry to Russia resumed. The resumption of U.S. poultry shipments to Russia was delayed due to Russian demands for plant inspections. A compromise was reached in 2010, but exports still dropped by 70% by 2011. Russia's inadequate intellectual property rights protection has deterred U.S. investors, leading to Russia being on the USTR's priority watch list for IPR issues. The United States and U.S. business community have concerns about Russian economic policies and regulations, citing structural problems and inefficient government regulations hindering trade and investment. Issues with Russian customs regulations have also been raised. Russia's efforts to join the WTO are tied to PNTR, with concerns raised about IPR enforcement and SPS regulations. Russia's efforts to join the WTO have faced challenges, including issues with sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, subsidies for the agricultural sector, state-owned enterprises, and impediments to imports of products containing encryption technology. Despite initial setbacks, Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan decided to pursue WTO accession separately. President Obama and President Medvedev pledged to resolve remaining issues by September 30, 2010, with the U.S. providing technical assistance. On October 1, 2010, the U.S. and Russia reached an agreement on WTO accession. On October 1, 2010, the USTR announced that the United States and Russia reached an agreement on Russian commitments related to IPR laws. Russia completed negotiations with the Working Party, and on December 16, 2011, formally joined the WTO. President Putin signed the accession into law on July 21, 2012, and Russia officially became a WTO member on August 22, 2012. PNTR was a significant issue in Russia's WTO accession, leading to the nonapplication of WTO rules in trade with Russia. The U.S. removed the application of Title IV to trade with Russia and granted PNTR to Russia by law in December 2012. The USTR was required to report annually on Russia's implementation of WTO commitments, including SPS standards and IPR protection. Additionally, the USTR had to report on actions taken to enforce Russia's compliance with WTO commitments. The USTR and Secretary of State report annually on promoting the rule of law in Russia and supporting U.S. trade. The Secretary of Commerce takes measures against bribery and corruption in Russia. The USTR includes a description of Russian policies affecting U.S. digital trade in its annual report. The law also authorizes PNTR for Moldova and includes the Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012."
