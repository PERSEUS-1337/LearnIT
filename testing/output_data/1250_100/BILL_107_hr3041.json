    "content": "The \"Travel America Now Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Prior to September 11, 2001, the travel and tourism industry in the United States employed over 19 million people with a payroll of $171.5 billion annually. In 2000, the industry generated over $582 billion in expenditures and $99.6 billion in tax revenues. Following the terrorist attacks, efforts are being made to ensure safe travel and maintain traveler confidence. Urgent measures are needed to support the industry and its workforce. Increased consumer spending on travel and tourism is crucial for the United States economy to recover. Encouraging both personal and business travel can help keep people employed and generate cash flow to stimulate economic growth. SEC. 3. PERSONAL TRAVEL CREDIT. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section for a Personal Travel Credit. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a Personal Travel Credit for individuals. The credit allows for a maximum of $500 ($1,000 for joint returns) for qualified personal travel expenses incurred between the enactment date and January 1, 2002. Qualified expenses include travel by various means and lodging at commercial facilities, excluding expenses for meals and entertainment. The term 'qualifying personal trip' refers to travel within the US that is at least 100 miles from the taxpayer's residence, involves an overnight stay at a commercial lodging facility, and is taken after the enactment date. The term does not include travel expenses deductible for business or income-producing activities. A 'commercial lodging facility' includes hotels, motels, resorts, rooming houses, or campgrounds. No credit is allowed for dependents under this section. The section allows a deduction for qualifying personal trips taken within the US, involving an overnight stay at a commercial lodging facility. Taxpayers must substantiate expenses to claim the credit, and no double benefit is allowed. SEC. 4. TEMPORARY INCREASE IN DEDUCTION FOR BUSINESS MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT. The deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses is temporarily increased to 100 percent for expenses paid or incurred between the enactment date and January 1, 2002. Effective for taxable years ending after the enactment date. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow travel and tourism industry losses to be carried back as net operating losses for the five years preceding the loss year. Special rules are introduced for these losses, defining them as the lesser of certain amounts. The term 'travel or tourism loss' is defined as the lesser of the net operating loss for the taxable year from income and deductions related to travel or tourism businesses, or the overall net operating loss for the year. A 'travel or tourism business' includes activities like commercial transportation, lodging, airport operations, travel agency services, and entertainment facilities. The provision allows for the coordination of travel or tourism losses with specified liability losses for tax purposes. Taxpayers can elect to adjust the carryback period for losses without regard to specific provisions. Related taxpayers can also make similar elections under prescribed regulations. The provision allows for a 5-year carryback of travel or tourism losses that can be credited against taxable income of a controlled group of corporations. The amendments apply to taxable years before, on, or after the enactment of the Act. The Act is based on Congress's power to levy taxes as outlined in article I, section 8 of the US Constitution."
