    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Contraception Access and Education Act of 2014\". Congress finds that 3.4 million pregnancies in the US are unintended, with 4 in 10 ending in abortion. Emergency contraception is safe and effective, reducing pregnancy risk by up to 95%. It can be effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception works by suppressing ovulation, preventing fertilization within 120 hours. It does not end established pregnancies. Most brands contain the same hormones as regular birth control. The use of emergency contraception among sexually active women aged 15-44 in the US increased from 4.2% in 2002 to 11% in 2006-2010. Teen pregnancy rates in the US have decreased by 51% since 1990, possibly due to increased contraceptive use. Despite an increase in emergency contraception use, disparities exist for young, urban, minority women who lack knowledge about it. Only half of obstetricians/gynecologists offer emergency contraception to all patients in need, highlighting the need for greater awareness and education. Approximately 1 out of 5 American women is a victim of rape, with an estimated 25,000 to 32,000 pregnancies resulting from rape each year. Emergency contraception can help rape survivors avoid unintended pregnancies. Only 18 States and the District of Columbia require hospitals to provide emergency contraception services to sexual assault survivors. Some states have restrictions on emergency contraception, while others allow pharmacists to refuse dispensing it. Various medical associations endorse wider availability of emergency contraceptives due to their safety and effectiveness. Healthy People 2020 aims to increase the availability of emergency contraception through public health providers and reduce unintended pregnancies by 10%. Public awareness campaigns are crucial in removing barriers to access emergency contraception for women in the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, emergency contraception is defined as a drug or device used postcoitally to prevent pregnancy primarily by preventing ovulation, approved by the FDA. A health care provider includes individuals licensed to provide health care services, including pharmacists. A hospital is defined as a facility under the Social Security Act. The term \"sexual assault\" is defined as a non-consensual sexual act, as per section 2246(2) of title 18, United States Code. This definition applies to all individuals. Survivors of sexual assault can receive emergency contraception from hospitals without charge. Federal funds for hospitals under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act are contingent on compliance with conditions for victims of sexual assault. Hospitals must provide accurate information on emergency contraception to women who report or are suspected victims of sexual assault. The Food and Drug Administration approves emergency contraception for all women without age restrictions. It is safe and effective in preventing pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. Hospitals must offer and provide emergency contraception promptly upon request. Information provided must be clear, concise, and easily understood. Services cannot be denied based on inability to pay. The section will take effect after 180 days from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will publish criteria for implementation 30 days before the expiration of this period. SEC. 5. EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION EDUCATION AND INFORMATION PROGRAMS. The Secretary will develop and disseminate information on emergency contraception to the public through various channels, including health agencies, organizations, and media. The information will cover evidence-based standards of care, proper use, safety, efficacy, counseling, and availability. Additionally, a program will be established to provide emergency contraception information to healthcare providers. The Secretary, in consultation with medical organizations, will provide healthcare providers with information on emergency contraception, including evidence-based standards of care, proper use, safety, efficacy, counseling, and availability. Recommendations for use in appropriate cases and for healthcare providers in emergency rooms to consult with sexual assault survivors will also be included. The section authorizes appropriations for necessary follow-up care, referral services, and distribution of information developed for patients."
