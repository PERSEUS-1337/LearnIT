    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act\". It includes findings related to food allergen labeling. Congress finds that approximately 2 percent of adults and 5 percent of infants and young children in the United States suffer from food allergies. Each year, 30,000 individuals require emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die due to allergic reactions to food. Eight major foods account for 90 percent of food allergies, with no cure currently available. A food allergic consumer must avoid the specific food they are allergic to. Additionally, a study found that 25 percent of sampled foods in Minnesota and Wisconsin failed to list peanuts or eggs as ingredients on food labels. The number of recalls due to unlabeled allergens increased nationally to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier. A recent study revealed that many parents of children with food allergies struggle to identify ingredients derived from major food allergens on food labels. Ingredients in foods must be listed by their common or usual name, but some consumers may not recognize ingredients that contain major food allergens. Certain additives like spices, flavorings, and colorings are exempt from ingredient labeling requirements. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that damages the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, with the current recommended treatment being avoidance of certain foods. The prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 percent of the general population. The current recommended treatment is avoiding foods containing glutens associated with celiac disease. SEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING ALLERGENIC SUBSTANCES. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include requirements for labeling food products containing major food allergens. The label must clearly state the presence of allergens and their food source in the list of ingredients. The labeling requirements for food products containing major food allergens include specifying the allergen in the ingredient list and ensuring consistency in labeling. The Secretary may allow alternative labeling if it protects public health. Spices, flavorings, colorings, or additives containing major food allergens must also be labeled. The Secretary has the authority to modify or eliminate labeling requirements through regulation. The Secretary has the authority to modify or eliminate labeling requirements for food allergens to protect public health. Spices, flavorings, colorings, or additives containing major food allergens must be disclosed as specified by the Secretary. The term 'major food allergen' includes milk, egg, and fish. The Secretary has the authority to modify or eliminate labeling requirements for food allergens to protect public health. Major food allergens include milk, egg, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include additional allergens. Effective January 1, 2006, foods containing major allergens must comply with labeling requirements. The Secretary has the authority to modify or eliminate labeling requirements for food allergens to protect public health. Major food allergens include milk, egg, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. Effective January 1, 2006, foods containing major allergens must comply with labeling requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report by June 30, 2004, analyzing unintentional contamination of major food allergens during manufacturing. The report should estimate the prevalence of these practices in the food industry and recommend good manufacturing practices. The report recommends good manufacturing practices to reduce cross-contact of major food allergens, describes various types of advisory labeling used by food producers, determines how consumers prefer information about cross-contact risks on food labels, and identifies appropriate circumstances for advisory labeling. SEC. 5. INSPECTIONS RELATING TO FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services prioritizes increasing inspections of food facilities to ensure compliance with practices to reduce cross-contact of major food allergens and proper labeling. Biennial reports are submitted to Congress detailing inspection findings, violations, and voluntary recalls. The biennial reports to Congress include voluntary recalls of foods with undeclared major food allergens, assessment of advisory language use, and addressing cross-contact issues by the Secretary and the food industry. SEC. 6. LABELING OF GLUTENS AND CELIAC DISEASE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review on glutens associated with celiac disease, prevention and treatment methods, and gluten detection in foods. The Institute of Medicine will collaborate with experts in celiac disease for the review and report submission within 2 years. The Secretary will issue rules for gluten labeling on foods, defining and permitting the term \"gluten-free\" within 4 years of enactment. A final rule will be issued within 6 years. A report assessing additional labeling requirements for gluten will be submitted to relevant committees within 2 years. The Secretary will issue rules for gluten labeling on foods, defining and permitting the term \"gluten-free\" within 4 years of enactment. A report assessing additional labeling requirements for gluten will be submitted to relevant committees within 2 years. Individuals with celiac disease may require specific labeling. SEC. 7. DATA ON FOOD-RELATED ALLERGIC RESPONSES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must complete a study within one year to determine if current systems accurately capture data on food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. This includes identifying new systems or enhancements for data collection and analysis. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will improve data collection and publish national data on the prevalence of food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. A report on the progress will be submitted to Congress within 30 months of the enactment of the Act. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums may be appropriated as necessary for carrying out this section. SEC. 8. FOOD ALLERGIES RESEARCH. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a panel of experts to review and coordinate research on food allergies. A plan for research expansion must be submitted to Congress within a year. SEC. 9. FOOD ALLERGENS IN THE FOOD CODE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will revise the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergen-free foods in various food establishments. Additionally, technical assistance will be provided for the treatment and prevention of allergic responses to foods."
