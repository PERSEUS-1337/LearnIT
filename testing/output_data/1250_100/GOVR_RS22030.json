    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence fields. The EU aims to harmonize policies among its 28 member states to promote peace, economic prosperity, and internal security while safeguarding citizens' rights and enabling free movement within the Schengen area. The 2001 terrorist attacks in the EU prompted efforts to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement and counterterrorism measures. Member states initially had concerns about common JHA policies infringing on national sovereignty, but the attacks led to increased collaboration in tracking down suspects and freezing assets. The attacks highlighted the need for improved border security and legal frameworks to combat terrorism effectively. Most EU member states lacked anti-terrorist legislation and a legal definition of terrorism, allowing terrorists to evade capture by fleeing to countries with different laws. Extradition requests were slow, prompting the EU to harmonize laws, establish a common definition of terrorism, an EU arrest warrant, and enhance tools for counterterrorism efforts. The EU implemented tools to combat terrorist financing, strengthen border controls, and enhance aviation security. Incidents like the 2004 Madrid bombings and 2005 London bombings led to the establishment of a Counterterrorism Coordinator to improve intelligence sharing and address homegrown extremism in Europe. The EU adopted its first plan in 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream opinions, and enhancing security. In 2008, the EU expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses to prosecute individuals involved in terrorist activities and counter terrorist propaganda. The EU established a Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite political commitment to enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, challenges remain in forging common EU policies due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states. Sharing information among national police and intelligence services and with EU bodies like Europol is often hindered. EU policymakers are concerned about European citizens joining terrorist groups like ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa. Up to 5,000 EU citizens may have traveled to fight in conflict zones since 2011. Security services fear the potential threat these trained militants pose upon returning to Europe, as well as the risk of \"lone wolf\" attacks inspired by extremist propaganda. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have been linked to ISIS and other extremist groups. The killing of four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium, believed to be carried out by a French Muslim with ties to Islamist fighters in Syria; The attacks in Paris, France in January 2015, where gunmen killed 17 people in incidents targeting Charlie Hebdo, police officers, and a kosher supermarket; The shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark in February 2015, where a self-radicalized Danish-born citizen of Palestinian descent murdered two people and wounded five police officers; The attempted attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris in August 2015, thwarted by passengers including three Americans; The coordinated attacks in Paris in November 2015, leaving 130 dead and over 350 injured. European authorities have encountered difficulties monitoring potential assailants and have been hampered by insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and chaos from migrant influxes. The thwarted train assailant and alleged Brussels gunman traveled between European countries before the attacks. The suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks may have traveled between Europe and Syria despite being known to authorities. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Despite some progress, the EU continues to struggle with addressing the evolving foreign fighter phenomenon. EU initiatives are making progress in addressing the foreign fighter threat by enhancing information sharing among member states through databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. The European Counter Terrorism Centre was launched in 2016 for operational cooperation. Success of these efforts depends on receiving information from national authorities. Some EU officials assert an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases, but concerns remain about EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism. The EU is finalizing the establishment of an EU-wide system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, following pressure after the 2015 Paris attacks. This system aims to facilitate information sharing on foreign fighters and harmonize PNR practices across member states. The EU is finalizing an agreement to collect Passenger Name Record (PNR) data from airlines for flights into and out of EU territory. Member states will also be allowed to collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier economic operators. Critics argue that the PNR system infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it does not go far enough in ensuring meaningful data sharing. EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement's provisions once formally adopted. EU officials are urging national authorities to utilize security tools provided in the Schengen Borders Code to address the surge of migrants and refugees into Europe and the attacks in Paris. The European Commission proposed a \"targeted modification\" to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the Schengen area's external borders. Additionally, a new European Border and Coast Guard is proposed to reinforce member states' capacities at the EU's external borders. The EU is working on reinforcing member states' capacities at the external borders through joint operations and rapid interventions. Efforts to establish an \"EU border guard corps\" have faced challenges regarding national sovereignty concerns. The EU is also focusing on detecting and removing online content promoting terrorism, establishing an Internet Referral Unit and Internet Forum for this purpose. Additionally, the EU is calling for efforts to address societal factors in prisons that may contribute to radicalization. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training across the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws has been challenging due to varying national policies, but updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. In December 2015, the European Commission proposed revising the EU's common terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat. The EU is revising its common terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat, which will be considered by EU member states and the European Parliament. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism has improved since September 11, 2001, leading to positive developments in law enforcement and homeland security dialogue. The Obama Administration continues to support cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. In 2011, President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasized partnering with European allies, the European Parliament, and the European Union to enhance counterterrorism efforts. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, focusing on combating violent extremism and foreign fighters. U.S.-EU cooperation has been addressing concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. Worries have been expressed about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the U.S. and most EU countries. In early July 2014, the U.S. Attorney General emphasized the need for shared strategies with EU countries to address the issue of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. Cooperation between U.S. and EU officials focused on counter-radicalization, border security, and information sharing to combat the foreign fighter threat. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 and provided support to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. After the January 2015 attacks in Paris, the U.S. Attorney General participated in an emergency meeting with European and North American interior ministers. Attorney General participated in a meeting with European and North American interior ministers to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. U.S. officials have been urging European governments and the EU to enhance information exchanges and utilize existing databases to combat violent extremism. President Obama called on the EU to implement agreements for sharing passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon. Challenges remain in the evolving U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, including data privacy concerns, detainee policies, and differences in terrorist designation lists. Legislation passed in December 2015 to strengthen the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control are ongoing. EU officials at various levels have significantly increased cooperation with the U.S. on police, judicial, and border control policies since 2001. This collaboration includes regular meetings between U.S. and EU counterparts to discuss terrorism, terrorist financing, border security, and other related issues. Additionally, expert-level dialogues on critical infrastructure protection and preventing violent extremism have been established, along with reciprocal liaison relationships between U.S. and EU agencies. Europol has stationed two liaison officers in the U.S. Europol and the United States have established reciprocal liaison relationships to work on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime. The U.S. has stationed 14 officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague, representing 11 different federal law enforcement agencies. This collaboration has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes, including the 2014 operation against online \"dark net\" marketplaces. Additionally, a U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague since 2006 to facilitate cooperation on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation. In 2001 and 2002, U.S. and Europol agreements allowed sharing of strategic and personal information. Negotiations were challenging due to EU data protection standards. Concerns over privacy slowed negotiations for cooperation agreements. In 2007, a security agreement for classified information was signed. In 2010, extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties between the U.S. and EU entered into force. The extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties between the U.S. and EU, signed in 2010, aim to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. Washington agreed to EU demands that extradited suspects will not face the death penalty, and the treaties modernize cooperation by streamlining information exchange and setting extradition priority rules. The MLA treaty between the United States and EU member states allows U.S. authorities access to European financial information, speeds up request processing, permits evidence acquisition through video conferencing, and enables U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Critics question the need for collaboration with EU bodies, citing existing bilateral relations between U.S. agencies and national services in EU states. Europol's lack of enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information are noted. European officials criticize the U.S. for expecting intelligence sharing without reciprocating. European opposition to the U.S. death penalty and reluctance to extradite their nationals may hinder timely cooperation. Most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhanced cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. New agreements in 2015 aimed at improving U.S.-Europol cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. The United States and the EU work together to track and stem terrorist financing, with access to financial data through SWIFT. The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program has generated over 7,000 reports. The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) has provided over 7,000 investigative leads for EU governments, aiding in the prevention of terrorist attacks in Europe. However, the program and the U.S.-EU agreement on sharing SWIFT data face ongoing controversy in Europe due to data privacy concerns. U.S. and EU officials have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups, aiming to present a united front and curb terrorist financing. The EU maintains separate lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, including those associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes Al Qaeda-affiliated groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and ISIS. The list has over 80 individuals or entities worldwide. Law enforcement measures vary based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. EU member states must freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for \"external\" groups. The EU's common terrorist list includes various groups and individuals, with law enforcement measures differing for \"external\" and \"internal\" entities. National governments aim to apply their own sanctions to prevent financing for listed individuals and groups. Unanimous agreement among all EU member states is required to add or remove a person or entity from the list. The United States and other countries have influenced the EU to add organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah to the list. The U.S. has also included members of ETA in its terrorist designation lists, showing some alignment with the EU. The EU faces challenges in fully harmonizing its terrorist designation lists with the U.S., particularly regarding Hamas-related charities and Hezbollah. Some EU members view these entities differently, leading to divisions on their inclusion in the common terrorist list. The U.S. considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization, while some EU countries have differing opinions on its designation. In 2012-2013, the EU debated adding Hezbollah to its common terrorist list due to events like the Burgas airport bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus. Some EU members hesitated, citing Hezbollah's role in Lebanon's government and its social services in poor communities. In late July 2013, the EU decided to add Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, not the entire organization, due to concerns about destabilizing Lebanon. This move was seen as a compromise to still allow dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and continue assistance to the country. The decision was largely symbolic, sending a message that the EU would not tolerate terrorist attacks within its borders. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, sending a message against terrorist attacks within its borders. Experts hoped this would lead to increased intelligence investigations into Hezbollah's activities in Europe. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as Hezbollah could still fundraise in Europe. The US had long urged the EU to include Hezbollah on its terrorist list, especially after Hezbollah was implicated in the Burgas bombing in Bulgaria. The House and Senate sent letters to EU officials urging them to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, a move welcomed by the Obama Administration and many Members of Congress. Data privacy remains a key issue in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords. Some EU officials are concerned about the level of protection for European citizens' personal data in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords. Unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs have strained transatlantic trust and raised worries about data protection safeguards. The European Parliament plays a key role in approving these accords, and there are concerns about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. The European Parliament expressed concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and established a working group to investigate. The \"Moraes report\" criticized NSA's mass surveillance and recommended changes to U.S.-EU security and economic issues, including calls to suspend the SWIFT agreement and review the U.S.-EU PNR accord. The European Parliament urged the timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement, calling for stronger safeguards for data transferred outside the EU. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with final approval expected in early 2016. Some U.S. officials and business leaders are concerned about the potential impact of these provisions. Some U.S. officials and business leaders worry about new provisions that could hinder U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and burden U.S. companies. U.S. officials reassure EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight. A U.S.-EU working group was established to address concerns about NSA surveillance operations and data privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Commission issued recommendations to restore transatlantic trust. In 2014, U.S. and EU policymakers worked on implementing proposals to restore transatlantic trust. The Judicial Redress Act was passed in 2016 to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for data privacy violations. Controversy over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program emerged in 2006. In 2007, the U.S. and EU agreed to allow U.S. access to SWIFT data for counterterrorism, sparking concerns over EU rights. Changes in SWIFT's systems in 2009 led to a new U.S.-EU agreement, but the European Parliament rejected it in 2010. The European Parliament rejected a U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in 2010 due to concerns over data privacy and civil liberties. Negotiations for a revised agreement began in May 2010, focusing on issues such as judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. and the use of \"bulk data\" transfers. Some MEPs called for more targeted transfers and greater supervision over U.S. access to SWIFT data. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded between U.S. and EU officials, allowing for supervision by an EU-appointed authority over U.S. access to SWIFT data. The draft included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority to approve U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Additional changes were made to the draft to address concerns of some MEPs, including the appointment of an independent observer in Washington, DC, to oversee data extraction and plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP to enable SWIFT data extraction on European soil. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in July 2010, entering into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period. Despite concerns about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP, the agreement was extended automatically unless notified otherwise. Some MEPs criticized Europol for approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended measures for transparency in the TFTP, with a second review in December 2012 confirming its benefits in fighting terrorism. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in 2010, with concerns about U.S. surveillance activities in Europe leading to calls for suspension of the agreement. Unauthorized disclosures since 2013 have renewed European concerns about data handling by the United States. The Parliament passed nonbinding resolutions calling for suspension of the SWIFT accord, but actual suspension would require action by the European Commission and member states. In late 2013 and mid-2014, reviews of the TFTP program showed that SWIFT data provided valuable leads for European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats, including those during the 2012 London Olympics and posed by EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The initial PNR agreement between the United States and EU in May 2004 allowed airlines to share passenger data, but it was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. The European Parliament challenged the agreement in court, leading to its annulment in May 2006. In July 2007, the United States and the EU reached a new agreement on the transfer of PNR data. The agreement allowed for sharing data with other U.S. agencies, extended data storage time, and permitted access to sensitive passenger information. Airlines were required to send data to U.S. authorities 72 hours before a flight, with a reduction in the number of data fields collected. The European Parliament needed to approve the agreement for it to be formally in force. The European Parliament had to approve the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement for it to be formally signed. Many MEPs objected to key elements such as data transfer amount and retention time. Concerns were raised about data misuse and potential profiling by U.S. authorities. Despite recognizing the legal uncertainties of rejecting the agreement, the Parliament postponed its vote in May 2010. The European Commission then called for a renegotiation of PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada in September 2010. The Commission proposed principles for using PNR data to combat terrorism and transnational crimes, ensuring passenger rights, limiting data exchange, and retention. The European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the U.S., emphasizing the need for data exchange to be necessary and proportional, without data mining or profiling. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord with the EU in recognition of the EP's reluctance to approve the 2007 agreement. U.S. officials maintained that the current PNR program effectively protects data and privacy rights, emphasizing the need for any revised accord to maintain operational effectiveness. Resolutions in the House and Senate supported the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urged DHS to reject any EU efforts to modify the agreement in a way that would hinder its usefulness in combating terrorism. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission finalized a revised PNR agreement with new provisions to enhance passenger data protection. The agreement included depersonalizing and masking passenger records after six months, reducing data storage time, and limiting access to authorized personnel. It also clarified passenger rights, ensured no boarding denials based solely on automated data processing, and allowed for consultation if the EU developed its own PNR system in the future. Despite revisions to the U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011, some MEPs were still unsatisfied. Concerns included the retention of passenger data for up to 15 years, increased data transmission requirements, and broadened use of PNR data for criminal offenses. U.S. officials argued that the new draft addressed EU concerns and improved operational effectiveness. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, addressing concerns raised by the EU regarding data security, scope of offenses covered, and passenger rights. The agreement included changes such as limiting PNR data use to terrorist or serious transnational crimes with varying retention times based on the type of crime. Despite approval by EU member states in December 2011, some countries abstained due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs criticized the data retention and redress provisions in the new U.S.-EU PNR accord as insufficient, while others supported it citing stronger data protection guarantees. Despite concerns, the full Parliament approved the agreement in April 2012 with 409 votes in favor, 226 against, and 33 abstentions. U.S. officials welcomed the endorsement, emphasizing the shared commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. The U.S.-EU PNR accord was adopted by the EU in April 2012 and came into force in August 2012. It will be valid for seven years and can be renewed for another seven years. The European Commission stated that the PNR agreement is effective in combating terrorism and serious crimes, but some MEPs have raised concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards. The Parliament's resolution in March 2014 called for clarification on whether U.S. laws adequately protect PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. The U.S. and EU leaders see information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in fighting terrorism. U.S. officials have faced challenges in negotiating data-sharing agreements with the EU. Efforts have been made to establish an umbrella agreement where the EU would accept U.S. data privacy standards. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a U.S.-EU framework agreement to protect personal data in the fight against terrorism and crime. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate in 2010 for negotiating such an accord to apply to all U.S.-EU data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. The goal is to bridge differences in privacy rights application and ensure data protection. The EU and U.S. are working on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to ensure high standards of data protection in law enforcement. The agreement aims to bridge differences in privacy rights application and guarantee mutual recognition of data protection systems. The DPPA is seen as crucial in fighting terrorism and crime, with hopes for an EU finding of \"adequacy\" for U.S. data protection standards. The DPPA aims to bridge privacy rights differences between the EU and U.S. Negotiations have made progress on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues include purpose limitation and redress for EU citizens. EU officials push for judicial redress in the U.S., while U.S. administrations argue other redress options are available. The DPPA negotiations were stalled, but gained momentum after revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013. The European Parliament urged the U.S. to resume DPPA discussions for transatlantic trust. In 2014, the Obama Administration committed to seeking legislation for EU citizens to have judicial redress for privacy violations. The Obama Administration made efforts to finalize the DPPA and restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the DPPA text in September 2015, pending U.S. judicial redress legislation adoption. Legislation like H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 aimed to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries like the EU. The Judicial Redress Act was significant following the CJEU ruling invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement. The Act aimed to provide privacy protections for data shared with countries or organizations and address concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers. The Judicial Redress Act, passed in response to the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement, aims to provide privacy protections for data transfers. However, concerns remain about its effectiveness in meeting EU standards and addressing government access to personal data in the commercial sector. The Act includes provisions, such as the Cornyn amendment, which restrict its applicability to countries that permit data transfers to the U.S. without impeding national security interests. The Judicial Redress Act, signed into law in February 2016, is seen as crucial for the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA). The EU welcomed the act's enactment, stating it will help restore trust in transatlantic data flows. Approval of the DPPA by EU member states and the European Parliament is required for it to take effect, a process that could take several months. The U.S. and EU have emphasized cooperation in various areas over the past decade. Over the last decade, the United States and the EU have focused on enhancing cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security. They have signed agreements on information exchanges for lost passports, promoted biometric identifiers for travel document security, and collaborated on global aviation security measures. Additionally, they have worked together to improve cargo security and strengthen global supply chain security. The U.S. and EU continue to strive for a balance between enhancing border security and facilitating legitimate transatlantic travel. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security, with recent incidents like the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot prompting further discussions. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on international flights were introduced in 2014 due to concerns about terrorist threats. The US and EU have implemented rules and regulations to address the terrorist threat to aviation since 2001. They have worked together to bridge policy gaps, such as agreeing on coordinating air cargo security measures in 2008. This includes ensuring 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights to comply with security standards. In June 2012, the US and EU reached an agreement on air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's security regimes, enhancing cargo security and saving time and money for operators. This mutual recognition will enable European operators to meet the US requirement for 100% screening of cargo on passenger planes bound for the United States. Despite efforts to promote U.S.-EU cooperation in aviation and air cargo security, differences in perspective remain regarding the use of body scanners. While the United States accelerated installation of body scanners after the 2009 attack, some EU member states were hesitant due to privacy and health concerns. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards to protect passenger privacy and health, including the requirement for stick figure images and a ban on x-ray scans. The scanners were to be voluntary, with passengers having the option for a manual search. The EU adopted common standards for body scanners at airports, but member states are not required to deploy them. Some European officials are uneasy about body scanners at U.S. airports. In January 2013, the TSA announced the removal of revealing body scanners by June 2013. Concerns about privacy rights were raised by Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians. U.S. officials are worried about planned changes to EU regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage. EU and US regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage were tightened after a 2006 plot. Efforts were made to harmonize permitted amounts, but in 2010, the EU planned to lift restrictions by 2013 with improved screening technology. However, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of current screening methods, leading to a postponement of the deadline. The EU and US are working towards eliminating restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage. The EU lifted prohibitions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels in cabin baggage in January 2014, with plans to end all restrictions by January 2016. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, including extending the US Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. In May 2012, they agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities. The U.S. and EU have designated 15,000 companies as \"trusted traders\" to simplify procedures and lower costs. This agreement aims to allow customs authorities to focus on risky consignments and facilitate legitimate transatlantic trade. Recent tensions over 100% container scanning have receded, with EU officials deeming it unrealistic and costly. U.S. policymakers share concerns about the effectiveness and financial burden of such scanning, highlighting existing programs to identify high-risk cargo. In May 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced in June 2014. Proponents argue that manifest data used to determine high-risk cargo is insufficient. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program and EU tensions arise from the desire for equal application to all member states. New EU members sought to join the VWP after 2004 enlargement but faced exclusion due to program requirements. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53), which included changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to strengthen security measures and allow more EU members to qualify. The act required VWP participant countries to meet security and passport standards, share information, and submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) allowed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP. The EU is pushing for the remaining five members to be admitted soon. In January 2014, a revised EU reciprocity mechanism was implemented to achieve full visa reciprocity with the U.S. and other countries. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country if there is no full visa reciprocity. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows visa-free travel for certain countries, including many European nations. The U.S. has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers, such as additional biographic information requirements and new screening procedures. Concerns have been raised about Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq who could easily return home or enter the U.S. without a visa. The November 2015 attacks in Paris, carried out by French and Belgian citizens, have heightened U.S. concerns about VWP security. The Obama Administration made changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security controls, including capturing travel information to terrorist safe havens. Legislation was passed to prohibit individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the U.S. under the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has been modified to require individuals from certain countries to obtain a visitor visa at a U.S. consulate before traveling to the United States. This includes the need for electronic passports, validation of machine-readable passports at entry points, and enhanced screening protocols. The restrictions also apply to individuals who have visited Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011. EU officials are concerned about the new requirements, arguing that they could create a de facto visa system and discriminate against dual nationals. The new Visa Waiver Program (VWP) restrictions affect European citizens traveling for legitimate reasons but may not detect those joining terrorist groups. Exemptions exist for government and military personnel, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis. Concerns have been raised about potential reciprocal measures by EU leaders and discrimination based on ethnicity. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals. Senator Jeff Flake introduced measure S. 2449 on January 20, 2016, aiming to reduce the EU's potential imposition of reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens traveling to Europe. U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. Tensions between the U.S. and Europe have been fueled by issues such as the treatment of suspected terrorist detainees, Guantanamo Bay, military commissions for enemy combatants, and the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" European media has also focused on the U.S. practice of extraordinary rendition and the possible presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe. The controversy over CIA detention facilities in Europe sparked investigations by European institutions. European leaders criticized U.S. detainee and interrogation policies for violating international law and human rights values. The Bush Administration defended these policies as necessary for fighting terrorism, causing tensions with Europe over Guantanamo detainees and rendition practices. Efforts to address European concerns included seeking agreements to transfer some detainees while holding others deemed too dangerous. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing the Guantanamo detention facility, with some EU members accepting released detainees while others declined. U.S. officials were frustrated by the reluctance of countries, including some in Europe, to accept more detainees. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing the Guantanamo detention facility, with Congressional opposition and restrictions hindering the process. In March 2011, President Obama signed an executive order allowing for indefinite detention of dangerous detainees. European policymakers are concerned about Guantanamo's role as a recruitment tool for terrorist groups and the well-being of detainees.
