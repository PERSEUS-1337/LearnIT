    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transferring Credits for College Completion Act of 2012\" and includes data reporting requirements. The \"Transferring Credits for College Completion Act of 2012\" amends the Higher Education Act to include data reporting requirements on the percentages of degree-seeking undergraduate students who transfer from another institution and obtain a degree or certificate within specified time frames. The section specifies that students can take up to 200 percent of the normal time to complete their program. This section will take effect one year after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS. Transfer of Credit Policies under the Higher Education Act of 1965 are amended to include requirements for institutions to indicate if courses are transferable for credit towards a degree at a public institution in the same state. Each public institution of higher education must enter into an articulation agreement with other institutions in the same state, including a common general education core curriculum and course numbering for transferable credits. Each public institution of higher education in a state must have an articulation agreement for transferable credits. An associate degree in arts or sciences from a public institution after July 1, 2014, can transfer as the first 2 years of a related baccalaureate program. Tribal colleges are exempt from this requirement. The Secretary cannot impose specific policies on institutions, except for articulation agreements. The Higher Education Act of 1965 prohibits the Department of Education from controlling the curriculum or personnel of higher education institutions. It also states that institutions cannot be forced to accept or enroll students, or accept transfer credits. Additionally, articulation agreements for transferable credits are required for public institutions of higher education. The Education Act of 1965 is amended to include requirements for comprehensive articulation agreements and to update the year from 2010 to 2014."
