    "content": "Section 17052.6 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in California is amended to allow a credit against the \"net tax\" for expenses related to household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The percentage of the allowable federal credit varies based on adjusted gross income, with different percentages for different income brackets. Adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California. Different income brackets have varying credit percentages, with higher incomes receiving lower credits. The percentages change for taxable years starting in 2016 and 2019. Adjusted gross income determines the credit percentage for household and dependent care services in California. Income brackets dictate varying credit percentages, with higher incomes receiving lower credits. The credit is limited to expenses for household services and care provided in the state, and earned income subject to tax under this part. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is also considered. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is considered earned income subject to tax in California, regardless of domicile. Child definitions for tax purposes are modified under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes, under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, a child is considered a qualifying individual if they receive over half of their support from a parent with custody for the majority of the year. If the child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year and the parents never married and lived apart for the last six months of the year, they are also considered qualifying individuals. The amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. This act provides for a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
