    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. CHIPRA allows states to expand eligibility for children under 19, but reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children. CHIP enrollees with family income over 300% of poverty can be covered under Medicaid or a separate CHIP program. States can exclude a block of income and receive federal funds based on approved state CHIP plans. Title XXI does not guarantee individual benefits but provides federal allotments to states. CHIP plans to allocate federal funds based on a distribution formula set in the law. Low-income children covered under a CHIP-financed Medicaid expansion receive benefits as per Medicaid law. States can cover these children by expanding Medicaid or creating a separate CHIP program. Many states opt to cover them under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways to reduce administrative burden. States can determine eligibility for separate CHIP programs based on factors like geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or family coverage options. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults. In October 2007, 17 states provided pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds. 6 states used waivers, and 12 states extended coverage to unborn children through CHIP SPAs. Nearly half of the 364,161 unborn children enrolled in CHIP in FY2008 were in California. CHIPRA introduced a new option for states to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with specific conditions to meet. Pregnant women can be covered under CHIP with eligibility restrictions similar to CHIP children. Coverage includes prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one. States can offer postpartum services and continue coverage through waivers. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were previously ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for five years. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for their first five years in the United States. The law required their sponsor's income and resources to be considered for eligibility. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the US and meet other eligibility requirements. The CHIP state plan option allows coverage for pregnant women without counting the cost against their sponsor. States must redetermine eligibility annually, requiring further documentation if initial legal residence proof is invalid. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives HHS authority to expand CHIP eligibility, including for childless adults and parents of eligible children. Some states use waivers to cover adults with CHIP funds, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal. Adult coverage waivers, initially effective for five years, are subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals for states with adult coverage waivers have not been approved since 2007, leading to some states transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, some states have CMS authority to extend coverage to childless adult populations using CHIP funds. CHIPRA terminates coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009, but states with existing waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage. Budget neutrality standards are required for future fiscal years. Under CHIPRA, coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers that were in effect during FY2009. Beginning in FY2012, allowable spending under the waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment and will be matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting the benchmarks will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. CHIPRA also includes provisions for access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, authorizing $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. CHIPRA allocates 10% of CHIP funds for a national enrollment campaign and 10% for Native American children outreach. The remaining 80% goes to state and local governments for outreach in rural and underserved areas, focusing on cultural and linguistic barriers. States must describe procedures to reduce enrollment barriers and can use \"Express Lane\" agencies for eligibility determinations. The CHIPRA provision allows states to use Express Lane eligibility determinations for Medicaid or CHIP enrollment, with the option to rely on reported income from tax records. It eliminates the need for signatures on application forms and drops the requirement for proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants. Before DRA, states could accept self-declaration of citizenship for Medicaid, but CHIPRA now requires citizenship documentation in CHIP. Each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data are shown in Table 1. New Jersey has the highest income eligibility limit at 350% of the FPL. Some states have CHIP coverage above 250% FPL, while others have income thresholds between 200-250% FPL or at 200% FPL. Six states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children, with 5.3 million covered in state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid. Waiver authority has been used to expand coverage for adults, with about 335,000 adults enrolled in CHIP. Most were parents, with fewer childless adults and pregnant women. Adult enrollment decreased from previous years due to waivers not being renewed. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult than child CHIP enrollees in FY2008. States have the option to cover low-income children under their Medicaid program, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit plans. These plans offer similar benefits to separate CHIP programs. Children under age 21 in Medicaid eligibility groups must receive benefits through the EPSDT Program, including well-child care and immunizations. Under EPSDT, children receive well-child care, immunizations, and screening services, as well as medical care to correct identified defects or conditions. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or another approved health benefits plan. Benchmark benefit package options include plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield or state employee health coverage. Benchmark-equivalent coverage has the same actuarial value as specified plans. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for CHIP programs must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, and well-child care, as well as at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services such as prescription drugs and vision services. Abortions are only covered in specific circumstances. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs with different approaches. CHIP programs in the United States vary in their approach, with 18 states using separate state programs and 26 states using a combination approach. Benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans are often based on state employees' health plans, while secretary-approved plans are modeled after Medicaid. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. EPSDT services are also included in state CHIP plans. CHIP plans with EPSDT coverage satisfy mental health parity requirements. CHIPRA modified dental care, making it a required benefit including preventive, restorative, and emergency services. States can offer dental services through benchmark packages. The law also includes dental education for parents and services at health centers. States must report detailed dental care information for children. The federal Insure Kids Now website and hotline will offer dental services to the public. A study by GAO will assess children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers and using mid-level providers. CHIPRA allowed CHIP funds to be used for children in employer-sponsored coverage, including dental-only supplemental coverage. States can provide dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage under their separate CHIP programs, but must meet certain criteria. This includes implementing the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute, not limiting acceptance of applications or imposing enrollment caps, and providing benefits to all eligible children. States cannot provide more favorable dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage compared to CHIP children eligible for the full range of benefits. Additionally, states have the option to not apply an eligibility waiting period for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage under their separate CHIP programs, but must meet certain criteria. This includes implementing the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute, not limiting acceptance of applications or imposing enrollment caps, and providing benefits to all eligible children. States cannot provide more favorable dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage compared to CHIP children eligible for the full range of benefits. Additionally, states have the option to not apply an eligibility waiting period for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. CHIP funds used for employer-based plan premiums must ensure CHIP minimum benefits, cost-sharing ceilings, and a waiting period for children without group coverage. Medicaid allows premium assistance if the employer plan is cost-effective, with states required to provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for services not included in private plans. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance under waivers. CHIPRA created a new state plan option for outreach, education, and enrollment assistance. Employers must pay at least 40% of the premium, offer nondiscriminatory coverage, and meet specific criteria. Individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage can choose regular CHIP over premium assistance. CHIPRA allows individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage to opt for regular CHIP instead of the premium assistance program. The subsidy provided is the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for covering the child(ren) versus just the employee. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for using premium assistance for a child's coverage. CHIPRA also establishes a separate test for family coverage, where the subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it is less than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and can create employer-family premium assistance pools for smaller employers with CHIP-eligible individuals. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) allows CHIP-eligible pregnant women or children to receive premium assistance under Medicaid. CHIPRA also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a qualifying event for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing, including premiums, deductibles, and copayments, can be imposed by states for some CHIP beneficiaries. States covering low-income children under Medicaid must follow nominal cost-sharing rules. The Medicaid program rules allow for cost-sharing for children in CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs based on family income levels. Premiums and service-related cost-sharing can be applied, with limits based on income. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing. The DRA allows states to impose cost-sharing for Medicaid and CHIP programs, with special rules for prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. Premiums may be required for Medicaid eligibility, with limits based on family income. Service-related cost-sharing can be charged, with different limits based on income levels. Providers may deny care for non-payment of cost-sharing. The DRA allows states to impose cost-sharing for Medicaid and CHIP programs, with special rules for prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. Premiums may be required for Medicaid eligibility, with limits based on family income. Service-related cost-sharing can be charged, with different limits based on income levels. Providers may deny care for non-payment of cost-sharing. For CHIP families with income above 150% FPL, cost-sharing may be imposed, subject to out-of-pocket limit of 5% of family income. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. CHIPRA 2009 expanded data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid. The CHIPRA law directs the Secretary of HHS to develop child health quality measures and reporting formats for CHIP and Medicaid. Reporting requirements for states' annual CHIP reports were expanded to include data on eligibility criteria and access to care. A study on children's access to care under Medicaid and CHIP will be conducted by GAO. The establishment of the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) will review policies affecting children's access to benefits and provide recommendations for improvement. Regular reports to Congress will detail findings and recommendations for enhancing access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. The CHIPRA law mandated a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans, focusing on outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, and retention of children. Federal financing for CHIP includes appropriations, reallocation of funds, and factors like matching rates and administrative expense caps. BBA 97 allocated around $40 billion for CHIP allotments from FY1998 to FY2007. The funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) varied over fiscal years, with appropriations ranging from $4.2 billion to $5.0 billion. The \"CHIP dip\" in funding from FY2002-FY2004 was due to budget constraints. Attempts to reauthorize CHIP for FY2008-FY2012 were vetoed, leading to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 providing funds for FY2008 and FY2009. Additional funds were also appropriated to address projected shortfalls in certain states. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The allotment of the annual federal CHIP appropriation among the states is determined by a formula set in law, based on survey estimates of low-income children and uninsured children in each state. Prior to CHIPRA, territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation, with the remainder divided among states based on the formula. The allotments were adjusted by a geographic factor and limited by floors and ceilings to ensure consistency. The CHIP allotments are now calculated individually for each state and territory, rather than being divided based on state survey estimates. Each state's allotment is determined by a formula and if the total does not exceed the national appropriation, that will be the state's allotment. CHIP allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period of time, typically two years. States can draw from the earliest active account until it is fully expended, then move on to the next available allotment. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are based on a formula involving the state's previous federal CHIP spending and projections for the current fiscal year. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are calculated based on a formula involving previous federal CHIP spending and projections for the current fiscal year. For FY2010, the allotment is determined by four amounts multiplied by the growth factor, including FY2009 CHIP allotment and spending from various sources. FY2011 and FY2013 allotments are \"rebased\" on prior year spending, while FY2012 is based on the FY2011 allotment and Contingency Fund payments. The FY2011 state CHIP allotments are calculated based on previous allotments and Contingency Fund spending, multiplied by the state's growth factor. Unspent funds are redistributed to other states after a certain period. BBA 97 specified rules for redistribution, with additional funds appropriated in DRA to cover shortfalls in two states. In FY2007, unspent FY2004 funds were redistributed according to a bill passed in the 109th Congress. The National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006 required funds to be redistributed to states facing funding shortfalls in fiscal year 2007, delaying shortfalls until March 2007. The Act called for an initial redistribution of unspent FY2005 funds to delay shortfalls further, providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states, delaying any state facing a shortfall until May 2007. In May 2007, P.L. 110-28 allocated $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. Funding for FY2008 and FY2009 was also redistributed to states facing shortfalls, with a total of nearly $1 billion provided in FY2008. MMSEA appropriated up to $275 million for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. The increased FY2009 allotments provided by CHIPRA should prevent any federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. Under CHIPRA, any unspent funds available for redistribution would first be provided to shortfall states and then, toward bonus payments. The creation of a Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was an additional CHIPRA measure to prevent states from experiencing shortfalls of federal CHIP funds. Payments from the Contingency Fund cannot exceed 20% of that year's national allotment amount and are to be reduced proportionally if necessary. The federal government matches state spending from CHIP accounts for Medicaid, with a state's share being 100% minus the FMAP. The E-FMAP for CHIP reduces a state's share by 30% compared to the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is capped at 10% for state non-benefit expenses. Under CHIP, a 10% cap applies to state non-benefit expenses, tied to the dollar amount drawn down from the annual allotment. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available for increasing Medicaid child enrollment and specific outreach activities, funded by an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009."
