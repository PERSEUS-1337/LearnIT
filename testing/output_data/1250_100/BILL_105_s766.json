    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act of 1997\". Congress finds that approximately 3,600,000 pregnancies in the US are unintended each year, making up nearly 60% of all pregnancies. Contraceptive services are essential for family planning, reducing the need for abortion and saving public funds. Unintended pregnancies lead to negative health outcomes and economic strain on families. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality suggests that infant mortality could decrease by 10% if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraception. Private insurance in the United States often does not cover prescription contraceptives, leading to limited coverage for women of reproductive age. This results in women spending significantly more on out-of-pocket healthcare costs compared to men, with contraceptives being a major expense. The lack of insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives in the United States results in financial barriers for many women, leading to unintended pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Unintended Pregnancy recommends reducing these barriers by increasing insurance coverage for contraceptive services. SEC. 713 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 addresses standards for contraceptive benefits, aiming to reduce financial barriers for women and prevent unintended pregnancies. SEC. 713 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 mandates that group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot exclude benefits for FDA-approved prescription contraceptives or outpatient contraceptive services if they cover other outpatient drugs or services. The section prohibits health plans from penalizing individuals or healthcare professionals for using or providing contraceptive services. It also prohibits offering incentives to withhold contraceptive services. The section prohibits health insurance issuers from imposing high deductibles or cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs and devices under a group health plan. The section prohibits health insurance issuers from imposing high deductibles or cost-sharing for outpatient contraceptive services under a group health plan, ensuring that such costs are not greater than those for other outpatient health care services covered under the plan. Additionally, it requires coverage of experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services, unless the plan or issuer provides an exception. The section mandates coverage of experimental or investigational outpatient contraceptive drugs, devices, or services, with limitations on prescription volume and provider restrictions. The section requires second opinions and preauthorizations for coverage of outpatient contraceptive services under group health plans, with notice of such requirements as a material modification. State laws providing greater protections for enrollees are not preempted. The term 'outpatient contraceptive services' includes consultations, examinations, and procedures. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"contraceptive services\" as consultations, examinations, procedures, and medical services related to contraceptive methods to prevent unintended pregnancy. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of contents in a specific Act. The curr_chunk introduces new standards relating to benefits for contraceptives, effective for plan years starting on or after January 1, 1998. It amends the Public Health Service Act in the group market by adding a new section on standards for contraceptive benefits.

The curr_chunk outlines prohibitions for group health plans and insurance issuers regarding coverage for prescription contraceptives and outpatient services. It prohibits incentivizing individuals to accept less coverage, penalizing healthcare professionals for providing contraceptive services, or withholding contraceptive options. The curr_chunk prohibits health insurance issuers from imposing high deductibles or cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs and devices under group health plans. The curr_chunk expands on the prohibition of high deductibles or cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs and devices under group health plans by specifying limitations on outpatient prescription devices and services, as well as coverage for experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs or devices. The curr_chunk specifies limitations on outpatient prescription drugs, devices, and health care services, including restrictions on healthcare professionals and utilization review provisions for contraceptive drugs and devices.
