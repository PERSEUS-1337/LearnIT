    "content": "The Act titled \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\" is cited in Section 1. Congressional findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a severe economic decline and job losses. In response, the Treasury Department placed the GSEs in conservatorship and established a $200 billion facility to support them. In February 2009, the Obama Administration increased the senior preferred stock purchase commitment to $400 billion. On Christmas Eve 2009, they removed limits on Federal funds for losses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, resulting in over $110 billion in taxpayer funds spent. Taxpayers now own 80% of the GSEs, which are being used for Federal housing policy, making private ownership less likely. The Congressional Budget Office considers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as government entities, expecting them to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political factors. At the end of 2009, the Treasury Department and FHFA approved high compensation packages for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives, including $6,000,000 each for the CEOs, which is significantly more than the President's annual salary. These executives received cash bonuses instead of stock options, despite the government assistance received by the GSEs. The FHFA's Strategic Plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac emphasizes safe and sound operations. Section 1318(c) of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act allows the Director of FHFA to withhold executive compensation for review. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, a new compensation system will be established based on government pay rates. Additionally, there is a call for executive officers to return 2009 compensation to the Secretary of the Treasury. The corporation should return any excess compensation earned in 2009 to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary will transfer these amounts to a special account to reduce the national debt."
