Congress finds that a significant portion of the veteran population lives in rural areas, with younger veterans from recent conflicts more likely to reside in these areas. These rural veterans often face challenges accessing healthcare and other services due to long distances to VA facilities. Rural veterans make up a substantial portion of those enrolled in the VA patient enrollment system. (7) More rural veterans have disabilities compared to urban veterans. (8) Over 150,000 Armed Forces members transition to veteran status annually. (9) Transitioning between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs involves data coordination. (10) Electronic health records should be accessible to both departments for better healthcare information availability. Transportation grants are available for rural veterans service organizations. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has established a grant program to provide innovative transportation options to veterans in highly rural areas. Grants can be used to assist veterans in traveling to VA medical centers and providing medical care to veterans in these areas, with a maximum amount of $50,000 per grant. Recipients are not required to provide matching funds, and unused grant funds must be recovered by September 30 of the fiscal year. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has established a grant program for veterans in highly rural areas to access transportation options to VA medical centers. Recipients must use the grant for medical care and can receive up to $50,000 per grant. Unused funds must be returned by September 30 of the fiscal year. The Secretary will evaluate grant applications, administer the program, and submit an annual report to Congress on grant recipients and amounts. The term \"veterans service organization\" is defined as any organization recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for representing veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to conduct outreach to educate veterans and their families about transportation options to VA medical facilities in rural areas. Additionally, a pilot program is being implemented for electronic health record systems at VA medical facilities in rural areas. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, is conducting a pilot program at VA medical facilities in rural areas to implement electronic health record systems for interoperability between the Department of Defense and VA, improve healthcare quality for veterans, provide access to complete health information for discharged Armed Forces members, and enhance accessibility and efficiency. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, is conducting a pilot program at VA medical facilities in rural areas to increase accessibility, efficiency, and use of electronic health records for improved healthcare needs. The selected facilities must be in rural areas with a veteran population rate exceeding six percent. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to submit an annual report to Congress evaluating best practices, education and training provided to personnel, and the healthcare services offered to veterans in rural areas."
