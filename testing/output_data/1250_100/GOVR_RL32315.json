The conflict between environmental protection and the need for increased domestic energy production is a major policy issue. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices on public lands have been a topic of debate in Congress for years. The Mining Law of 1872 allowed for the transfer of oil and gas resources on public lands to private ownership through patenting. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California in 1909, leading to the Pickett Act of 1910. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process and established a leasing system, generating billions of dollars in revenues for the federal government. This created a \"split-estate\" where minerals owned by the federal government under privately held lands. The split-estate situation arises when mineral rights are owned by the federal government under privately held lands. Specific policies and procedures must be followed by mineral estate holders for mineral development, including obtaining surface agreements or consent from surface owners. Approximately 11% of public lands are under the split-estate category, with higher percentages in Wyoming and Montana. Environmental concerns have led to support for public land withdrawals and restrictions due to perceived inadequate environmental protection laws. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 lacked environmental protection. Ranchers and groups are concerned about the impact of development on water and land. Development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands. They mention compliance with NEPA, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, among others. The industry faces delays due to environmental reviews. Proposed energy bills aim to address concerns over domestic oil and gas supplies by expediting permitting on public lands. The House approved a conference report on Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas development. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is pending action. The report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including production and reserves. It also discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to meeting U.S. energy demand. The Bureau of Land Management develops Resource Management Plans for leasing public lands for oil and gas development. The process involves competitive leasing of tracts with potential, followed by the requirement of drilling permits for wells. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling 1.4 million acres. Environmental impacts are considered during land-use planning under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Resource Management Plans (RMPs) developed by the Bureau of Land Management cover large areas with diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The plans consider environmental impacts and benefits of public lands, ensuring compliance with regulations and allowing public participation. Through the planning process, lands with oil and gas potential are identified for leasing through competitive bidding to provide a fair market value return to the federal government. The government offers oil and gas leases on public lands through competitive bidding. If no bids meet the minimum acceptable bid, leases are offered noncompetitively. Tracts can be obtained by the first qualified applicant with a fee. Geophysical exploration permits can be issued for unleased lands. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for exploration and production. After obtaining an oil and gas lease competitively or noncompetitively, an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each well. The APD must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The BLM consults with the surface managing agency and processes the application within 35 days, with possible outcomes of approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay for more information. The applicant is notified of the final decision timeline. The approval process for an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) can be delayed due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development. This process, mandated under FLPMA section 1712, involves public involvement and plan revisions to align with current land use needs. Current planning regulations require preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act. The process of rewriting RMPs can take up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The rapid pace of coalbed methane development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in RMPs. Environmentalists argue that relying on 20-year-old plans for land management decisions is not ideal. The need for revised RMPs could delay site-specific analysis for drilling permits by the BLM and surface managing agency. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced strategies to expedite the permit process for drilling applications. This includes processing multiple permit applications together, implementing area development planning, and establishing standard operating practices. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized as open under standard terms, open with restrictions, or closed due to land withdrawals. Withdrawn lands often include wilderness areas and national parks that are unlikely to be reopened for leasing. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, with some areas closed due to land management decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites. Another 182 million acres are subject to surface management agency approval and must not conflict with land designations and plans. Wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas, and roadless areas are examples of lands in this category. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior, such as no surface occupancy, timing limitations, and controlled surface use. Industry argues that these restrictions hinder exploration and limit reserves, while environmental groups believe they are necessary for protecting non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region is a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to its significant natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands. Reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in this region, highlighting the importance of protecting public lands and the impact of Bush Administration policies. The EPCA Report focuses on five major geologic basins in the Rocky Mountain region, comparing data with the EIA and NPC studies. Natural gas resources in the region are estimated to be around 335 trillion cubic feet, with EIA estimating 293.6 tcf and EPCA finding 138.5 tcf in the major basins. Both NPC and EIA studies show similar percentages of natural gas closed and restricted for development in the region. The EPCA study found that 63% of proven natural gas reserves on federal lands in the Rocky Mountain region are open for leasing. Additionally, the study estimates that 600 million barrels of oil fall under the \"no access\" category, while 3.2 billion barrels are available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. The EPCA study estimates that about 2.5 billion barrels of oil are available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The study also suggests that greater flexibility in federal regulations could potentially make 29 trillion cubic feet of natural gas immediately available and reduce development costs for an additional 51 trillion cubic feet. Environmental groups raise concerns about the ecological impact of such developments. The NPC study estimates that 41% of the total gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf as of 1999. There are major policy disagreements regarding the importance of oil and gas reserves on public lands in meeting U.S. energy needs. The region represents 37% of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas resource base in the U.S. If the currently restricted 108 tcf of natural gas were produced, it could last 20-30 years, meeting about 15% of projected needs. The United States has sufficient natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with an estimated 1,351 tcf of natural gas available for development. About 16% of this supply is subject to restrictions that may prevent development, according to The Wilderness Society. The NPC argues that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is under restriction or lease stipulations, hindering production. They propose relaxing land-use constraints to allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation suggests focusing on the most viable resource categories to reduce access restrictions, making the restricted amount of resources much less significant. Total U.S. oil production is forecasted to decline annually, with imports expected to make up 65% of supply by 2025. Federal onshore oil production is concentrated in Wyoming, New Mexico, and California. Natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002. U.S. natural gas production is projected to increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are expected to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then decrease to 2.6 tcf in 2025 due to declining Canadian gas production. LNG imports are forecasted to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands has increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states in production, accounting for 85% of the total. U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with Texas leading in reserves. Oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, while production declined by 500 million barrels. Discoveries in 2001 and 2002 exceeded the average annual discovery since 1976. Despite available oil reserves, production is expected to decline in the long term. The United States has 92 billion barrels of technically recoverable onshore and state offshore oil resources, with reserves declining over time. Gas reserves have increased by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with annual discoveries up 70% above the average since 1976. Gas imports have risen to 17% from 9% in 1991, and technically recoverable gas resources are estimated at 1,000 tcf. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment in the Rocky Mountain West estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands account for 53.6%, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. Federal onshore oil is estimated at 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, and natural gas on public lands is estimated at 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet, and unconventional natural gas at 358.7 tcf. Coalbed methane gas is natural gas trapped in coalbeds, with extraction involving removing water to release the gas. Concerns about groundwater contamination have arisen, with varying water quality requiring different disposal methods. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized coalbed methane development, leading to a four-fold production increase since 1991. Production of coalbed gas began in 1987 and has increased four-fold since 1991. In 2002, coalbed gas accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the United States. There were 10,000 CBM wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day in 2002. Leading producers are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. DOE estimates 39,000 new wells by 2010, with 23,900 on federal lands. Only about 100 tcf of coalbed methane out of 700 tcf in the US are economically recoverable. CBM reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with Colorado and New Mexico holding over half of US reserves. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive area for coalbed methane (CBM) in the US, with 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, with 9% of US production and 8% of reserves. The Powder River Basin (PRB) has estimated CBM resources of 39 tcf, with the federal government owning over half of the mineral rights. Concerns have been raised about surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees, particularly in Wyoming where over 80% of CBM wells are on privately or state-held land. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 by the Petroleum Association, ranchers, and the Farm Bureau Federation to resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners. Environmental concerns regarding CBM production include land and water issues, such as disturbance, water usage, and disposal. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM has raised concerns about the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water, with a draft EPA report noting no evidence of contamination but expressing concern over the use of diesel fuel in the process. The EPA and major companies agreed to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid due to environmental concerns. Proposed energy legislation may prohibit EPA regulation of fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing. CBM production results in water discharges into surface waters and holding ponds, with concerns about pollution and groundwater contamination. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. is concerned about the impact of CBM production on water sources and wildlife habitats. BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells to monitor water quality and levels. IBLA invalidated three leases in 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM over CBM leases in the Powder River Basin, leading to a halt in lease sales. BLM finalized a new EA and RMP, planning to approve 39,000 permits for new wells. DOI decided to issue permits in July 2003, with a forecasted 1.6% rise in oil demand. The DOI decided to issue permits in July 2003 due to a forecasted 1.6% rise in oil demand by 2025. Demand for oil is expected to increase, leading to a projected 65% reliance on imports. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is uncertain, with challenges arising from restrictions and opposition to easing them. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, with more wells and deeper wells being drilled. The forecast predicts an increase in onshore unconventional natural gas production, with concerns about access to federal lands and environmental impacts. The U.S. is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG, and deepwater OCS production. The Rocky Mountain region may contribute up to 40% of U.S. natural gas production by 2025. Oil and gas firms are exploring worldwide for the best returns on investment. The United States offers political stability and a significant resource base for investment decisions. Public land use decisions must consider environmental and societal impacts. Leasing terms include maximum acreage, bonus bids, term length, and bond requirements. Rentals and royalties are also specified for competitive and noncompetitive leases. The onshore leasing program generates substantial annual revenues for the U.S. The onshore leasing program generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service. Revenues are distributed to states, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, and other designated programs. Alaska receives 90% of revenues collected, while other states receive 50%. Federal oil and gas leases totaled 23,000 in 2001, covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. The early days of the National Park Service (NPS) saw a philosophy focused on preserving objects and wildlife in national parks for future generations. Tension arose with the Forest Service's utilitarian approach to resource use. The debate over public lands withdrawal in the early 1900s centered on the President's authority to designate land unavailable for activities like homesteading and resource exploitation. The President has the authority to withdraw public lands for preservation purposes, as seen in various acts such as the Antiquities Act, Taylor Grazing Act, Organic Act, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and Wilderness Act. National monuments can be created through the Antiquities Act, with the President reserving the smallest area necessary for protection. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws, while the Organic Act regulated recreation areas. Withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or Congress under FLPMA. Under FLPMA, withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or Congress. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. Wilderness is defined as an area off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Congress has the sole authority to create National Parks and wilderness areas. The executive branch can use delegated power to withdraw public lands for preservation purposes. The executive branch and Congress have the authority to make withdrawals of public lands under FLPMA. Withdrawals can be temporary or permanent, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval. FLPMA replaced the implied authority with defined procedures for land withdrawals. Under FLPMA, public lands can be withdrawn for up to 20 years, subject to renewal, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years. A review of existing withdrawals in 11 Western states is mandated to determine their continuation. BLM is prioritizing the review of approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, with a focus on 26 million acres expected to be returned or become available. As of November 2000, BLM had reviewed approximately 7 million withdrawn acres, with over 6 million acres having their withdrawals revoked. The retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need, with a manager recommending against opening lands to multiple use, particularly mining and mineral leasing. The review process is ongoing, with withdrawals needing to be considered in BLM's planning process and supported by documentation under NEPA. Some lands may be developed for oil and gas resources, while others deemed unsuitable for mineral development will likely remain closed or restricted."
