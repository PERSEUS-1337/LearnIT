    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Prohibition of Cigarette Vending Machines Accessible to Minors in Federal Buildings and Lands Act\". It includes findings related to the issue. The Congress finds that cigarette smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco products are major health hazards causing over 420,000 deaths annually. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the US, with tobacco products containing hazardous additives and costing billions in healthcare expenses. Nicotine in tobacco products is a poisonous, addictive drug, and despite state laws prohibiting sales to minors, enforcement is lacking. Progress in reducing teenage tobacco use has been minimal in the past decade. Teenage smoking rates are rising, with over two-thirds starting before age 14 and 90% by age 18. Minors consume 516 million packs of cigarettes annually, half of which are illegally sold. Tobacco use is linked to illicit drug use, and the Federal Government plays a key role in discouraging tobacco use among minors. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
