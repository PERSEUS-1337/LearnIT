    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) leading to a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 was introduced by Senator Mitch McConnell to address the issue. Title II of the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006, along with other bills in Congress, addresses electronic surveillance programs for acquiring foreign intelligence and preventing terrorist threats. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides a framework for electronic surveillance and obtaining foreign intelligence information. The Bush Administration argued for the need for speed and agility in combating terrorism. The Bush Administration argued for the need for speed and agility in combating terrorism. Attorney General Gonzales advised that surveillance orders were issued to target international communications involving members of al Qaeda or associated terrorist organizations. All surveillance previously under the TSP will now be conducted with FISC approval. The President decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. Intelligence Committees were briefed on the classified details of the FISC orders. Leahy and Senator Specter were briefed on the NSA program, which has faced legal challenges. A U.S. District Court judge ruled the program unconstitutional, citing violations of various laws and amendments. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The docket sheets for Docket Nos. 06-2140 and 06-2095 indicate a letter from appellants' attorneys regarding orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 propose amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, addressing electronic surveillance programs and other related provisions. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to FISA definitions and criminal provisions, including addressing electronic surveillance programs. Sec. 3 of S. 3931 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. The proposed changes to FISA under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 include provisions for electronic surveillance programs, allowing for immediate surveillance in cases of suspect activity and extended surveillance for gathering foreign intelligence information. The FISC would have jurisdiction to review and authorize these programs, with initial authorizations lasting up to 90 days and reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. The proposed changes to FISA under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 include provisions for electronic surveillance programs, allowing for immediate surveillance in cases of suspect activity and extended surveillance for gathering foreign intelligence information. The FISC would have jurisdiction to review and authorize these programs, with initial authorizations lasting up to 90 days and reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of a target under Title VII of FISA if criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of FISA are met, unless certain conditions are met. Surveillance under Title VII can only continue if an application for an FISC order is made under Section 104 of FISA. The proposed changes to FISA under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 include provisions for electronic surveillance programs, allowing for immediate surveillance in cases of suspect activity and extended surveillance for gathering foreign intelligence information. The Attorney General can transfer cases involving classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review if it is deemed necessary for national security. The language in the proposed subsections of FISA regarding the transfer process is unclear and may require further clarification. The proposed changes to FISA under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 include provisions for electronic surveillance programs. The FISC is given jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of the program in criminal proceedings. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC or originating court may dismiss challenges to the legality of electronic surveillance. The FISC or originating court may dismiss challenges to the legality of electronic surveillance programs for any reason provided for under law. New subsections 702(b)(5), 703, and 704 of FISA set out requirements for applications and approval of such programs, including necessary findings for ex parte FISC orders. Factors for assessing constitutionality are outlined in subsection 704(b) of FISA. The Attorney General is required to report every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees on activities under electronic surveillance programs authorized by FISA. Amendments to FISA include repealing sections allowing the President to authorize surveillance. The proposed amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 would allow electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress. This amendment would provide an exception for officers, employees, or agents of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of their official duty. The current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) provision states that electronic surveillance can only be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal law, with exclusivity given to procedures outlined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The amendments to FISA address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The amendments to FISA increase criminal liability for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. Penalties include fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Additional amendments to FISA are also made. The amendments to FISA in Sec. 9(b) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(b) of S. 3929 expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and update the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under Sec. 101 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801. The amendments to FISA in Sec. 9(b) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(b) of S. 3929 expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and update the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under Sec. 101 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801. This includes surveillance of individuals in the United States with a reasonable expectation of privacy, requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition and dissemination of non-public information on U.S. persons during foreign intelligence activities. The amendments to FISA in Sec. 9(b) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(b) of S. 3929 expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and update the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under Sec. 101 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801. Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition and dissemination of non-public information on U.S. persons during foreign intelligence activities, including restrictions on disclosing information without consent or retaining it for longer than 72 hours without a court order. The amendments to FISA in Sec. 9(b) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(b) of S. 3929 would modify minimization procedures for electronic surveillance, ensuring that no contents of any communication from a U.S. person are disclosed, disseminated, used, or retained for longer than 7 days without a court order or Attorney General approval. This includes striking the current definition of \"wire communication\" and updating the definition of \"contents\" under FISA. The definition of \"contents\" in FISA would be updated to include information about the substance, symbols, sounds, words, purport, or meaning of a communication, excluding dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information. Electronic surveillance under FISA can be authorized without a court order for up to one year for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The application for electronic surveillance would be expanded to include the acquisition of communication contents of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The amendment to FISA removes a certification requirement regarding the acquisition of communication contents involving a U.S. person. Electronic surveillance must comply with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures, with assessments reported to congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must justify the belief that the target is indeed an agent. The current FISA amendment requires the Attorney General to justify electronic surveillance targeting a foreign power agent. It also allows the Attorney General to request assistance from common carriers for surveillance. However, this provision is missing in the proposed FISA amendment. Additionally, the proposed amendment grants new authority to the President for surveillance activities. The proposed FISA amendment grants new authority to the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US, as long as certain conditions are met. The Attorney General's certification for acquisition of foreign intelligence information does not need to specify the exact locations involved. Compliance with certification and minimization procedures is required, with reports to congressional intelligence committees. The FISC receives a copy of the certification under seal unless legality of the acquisition needs to be determined. The Attorney General can direct a person to provide necessary information and assistance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference with their services. Any records kept must adhere to approved security procedures. The new subsection 102(d) of FISA requires the government to compensate individuals providing aid at the prevailing rate. If directed to provide aid and failing to comply, the Attorney General can seek FISC intervention. Non-compliance with FISC orders could result in contempt of court. Individuals can challenge the legality of directives by filing a petition with the FISC review pool. Assigned judges must conduct an initial review within 24 hours, denying frivolous petitions and affirming directives. The petition to modify or set aside a directive must be affirmed by the assigned judge if not frivolous. If the directive is not modified or set aside, the judge must affirm it and order compliance. A petition for review of an FISC decision must be made within seven days, with the FIS Court of Review providing a written statement of reasons for its decision. Review of the FIS Court of Review decision can be sought from the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsections of FISA outline procedures for judicial proceedings, including maintaining records under seal, conducting proceedings expeditiously, and allowing ex parte review of classified information. Additionally, proposed subsections provide immunity from legal action for providers of communication services who comply with government directives. Proposed subsection 102(k) of FISA allows federal officers to use or disclose information on a US person acquired under Section 102 with Attorney General authorization, subject to minimization procedures. Information can only be used for lawful purposes and cannot be disclosed for law enforcement purposes without the Attorney General's authorization. Additionally, privileged communications obtained under Section 102 retain their privileged status. Subsections 102(m) and (n) outline procedures for using or disclosing information in federal or state/local proceedings. The federal government can only introduce or use information acquired under Section 102 of FISA in proceedings if it complies with specific requirements. Similarly, states or political subdivisions can only use such information in trials or hearings with certain conditions. The federal government and states can use information acquired under Section 102 of FISA in proceedings with specific requirements. An aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence if the information was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an authorization order. The U.S. district court has the authority to determine the lawfulness of Section 102 acquisitions and may review relevant materials in camera. Under proposed subsection 102(q) of FISA, the U.S. district court can suppress unlawfully obtained evidence from Section 102 acquisitions. Any court decisions related to Section 102 acquisitions would be binding on all other federal or state courts except for the U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA addresses federal officers acquiring foreign intelligence information. Federal officers under Section 102 of FISA can coordinate with law enforcement to investigate or protect against foreign threats. Directives and orders under Section 102 must be retained for 10 years. Amendments authorize the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges. The FISA amendments allow for FISC judges to approve electronic surveillance orders for foreign intelligence purposes. The President can authorize the Attorney General to submit applications to the FISC. Changes to Section 104 of FISA require specific certifications in applications for electronic surveillance orders. The FISA amendments allow for FISC judges to approve electronic surveillance orders for foreign intelligence purposes. The certification for such applications is made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an executive branch official designated by the President. The application must include information about the surveillance techniques and potential information concerning U.S. persons likely to be obtained. The proposed amendments to FISA would expand the list of officials who can request personal review of surveillance applications and make changes to the approval process for electronic surveillance orders. The proposed amendments to FISA would expand the list of officials who can request personal review of surveillance applications and make changes to the approval process for electronic surveillance orders. This includes modifying the subsections of FISA related to electronic surveillance approval and specifying the requirements for multiple surveillance devices under an order. The proposed amendments to FISA would modify the approval process for electronic surveillance orders, including specifying requirements for surveillance devices under an order. The changes involve excluding certain information from applications for court orders authorizing electronic surveillance on foreign powers and specifying the type of electronic surveillance involved in each order. Extensions of an order may be granted on the same basis as an original order with new findings required. The proposed amendments to FISA would modify the approval process for electronic surveillance orders, including specifying requirements for surveillance devices under an order. Extensions of an order may be granted on the same basis as an original order with new findings required, with specific conditions for extensions related to surveillance of foreign powers. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA allows for emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General in cases of emergency situations. Surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. The new language in S. 3931 and S. 3929 would grant authority for emergency electronic surveillance to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. This officer must be authorized by the President to conduct surveillance and inform the Attorney General. Additionally, a FISC judge must be informed as soon as possible after the decision to employ emergency surveillance is made. The new provision allows for emergency electronic surveillance to be authorized by an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. An application must be made to a FISC judge within seven days after the surveillance is authorized, replacing the previous 72-hour limit. The Senate authorizes emergency electronic surveillance, with restrictions on disclosure and use of information. The revised language requires minimization procedures to be followed. Modifications to FISA also address limitations of liability for those providing assistance with electronic surveillance. The revised language in FISA authorizes emergency electronic surveillance with restrictions on disclosure and use of information. It also addresses limitations of liability for those providing assistance with electronic surveillance. The revised language in FISA authorizes emergency electronic surveillance with restrictions on disclosure and use of information, including the destruction of unintentionally acquired information in certain circumstances. The amended provision in FISA allows for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents if they do not contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of harm. The amended provision in FISA allows for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents if they do not contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of harm. Sec. 9(g)(2) of S. 3930 and Sec. 209(g)(2) of S. 3929 make amendments to subsection 106(k) and Sec. 104 of FISA. Sec. 9(h) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(h) of S. 3929 amend the congressional oversight provisions of FISA to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system for FISC orders authorizing electronic surveillance. The amendments to FISA include adding a new category of \"agent of a foreign power\" for individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction activities. The amendments to FISA define individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction activities as \"agents of a foreign power.\" This includes those who knowingly engage in such activities on behalf of a foreign power. The amendments to FISA expand the definition of \"agents of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction activities. This encompasses the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as addressing international movements of targets for electronic surveillance and physical searches under FISA. The amendments to FISA broaden the definition of \"agents of a foreign power\" to cover individuals engaged in sabotage, international terrorism, or weapons of mass destruction activities. This includes addressing international movements of targets for surveillance and physical searches under FISA, with provisions for orders to remain in force even if the target is outside the United States. Additionally, there are proposed changes to the structure of FISA, including the creation of a new Title VII and redesignation of the current Title VII as Title VIII."
