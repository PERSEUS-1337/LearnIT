    "content": "From the mid-1970s until 2007, world markets experienced several spikes in crude oil prices due to supply disruptions and international conflicts. The United States established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War oil embargo. While strategic stocks cannot fully protect against market price fluctuations, elevated petroleum prices impact trade balance and disposable income. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War oil embargo to insulate oil-consuming nations from market price fluctuations during supply emergencies. Its existence aims to discourage the use of oil as a political weapon and mitigate economic impacts of disruptions. The Reserve helps calm markets, reduce price spikes, and buy time for crises to resolve themselves. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established after the 1973 oil crisis to prevent severe oil shortages by storing enough crude oil to replace imports for 90 days. Plans were initially for 500 million barrels, later increased to 750 million barrels. The SPR can be expanded to 1 billion barrels and is managed by the Department of Energy. It consists of five underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana, with caverns hollowed out from salt domes. The capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005. Inventory almost reached 700 million barrels before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. SPR oil is sold competitively through a Notice of Sale process. The Department of Energy estimates oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after the sale notice. The SPR could be drawn down initially at a rate of roughly 4.4 mbd for up to 90 days. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005, with inventory almost reaching 700 million barrels before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. A Life Extension Program was initiated in 1993 to upgrade or replace SPR facilities and infrastructure. The Arab oil embargo led to the establishment of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to develop emergency response plans, including strategic stocks representing 90 days of net imports. The United States has over 100 days' cushion with privately held stocks included in the calculation, but less than 20% would likely be available in an emergency. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the United States, along with privately held stocks, provides roughly 70 days of net import protection. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the expansion of the SPR to 1 billion barrels to maintain stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports. IEA member nations have a mix of stocks held by the oil industry and governments/supervisory agencies. The FY2010 budget includes funds for expansion activities at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with a site in Richton, MS being evaluated for capacity addition. Prohibitions are in place for SPR appropriations related to Iran's refining capacity expansion. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act authorizes SPR drawdown in severe energy supply interruptions. Congress enacted additional drawdown authority in 1990 (Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-383) after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, allowing the President to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for a short period without declaring a severe energy supply interruption. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made the SPR authorities permanent, enabling U.S. participation in emergency-sharing activities of the International Energy Agency. Under P.L. 101-383, a drawdown can be initiated in the event of an energy supply shortage. The authority allows for selling up to 30 million barrels of SPR oil over 60 days if the SPR level is above 500 million barrels. This authority was used by the Bush Administration in 2005 and may have been the model for a swap ordered by President Clinton in 2000. Legislation in the Senate aims to alter the authorities governing drawdown and sale from the SPR. The proposed legislation (S. 1462) would transfer drawdown authority from the President to the Secretary of Energy and allow for drawdown and sale in the event of a severe energy market supply interruption causing a significant increase in prices. This is a departure from existing authorities which focus on supply disruptions rather than high prices. The refined product reserves could be drawn down to mitigate weather-related events or other supply disruptions, with the broader authority allowing for drawdown in the event of a severe energy market disruption leading to a significant price increase. The increase in price from the emergency situation is likely to have a major adverse impact on the economy. The use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) historically relied on a physical shortage of supply, but price considerations were deliberately excluded to avoid influencing private sector practices. In recent years, refined product prices have been driven more by crude supply and price dynamics. Despite calls to release crude from the SPR during high prices in 2008, a drawdown would not have significantly affected prices. The legislation proposed requiring a report to Congress within 180 days on acquiring refined products for the Reserve at minimal cost. It would assess storage options and the option of exchanging crude oil in the SPR for refined products. Arguments for a refined product reserve include the efficiency of not having to first draw down SPR crude. The efficiency of not having to draw down SPR crude first is a key argument for a refined product reserve. However, there are concerns about potential offsets to price moderation and the cost of storing refined products compared to crude. Additionally, the need to periodically sell and replace deteriorating refined products adds to the challenges of maintaining a product reserve. The legislation enacted in May 2008 forbade DOE from acquiring royalty-in-kind oil for the SPR for the rest of the year. The decline in crude oil prices led to interest in refilling the SPR, with plans announced by the Bush Administration in January 2009 to purchase oil and reschedule deferred deliveries. This included purchasing 10.7 million barrels to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, returning 5.4 million barrels borrowed by refiners after Hurricane Gustav, and delivering 2.2 million barrels of deferred RIK oil. The government has not acquired oil for the SPR by outright purchase since 1994. Sales of SPR oil, not acquisition, were at the center of debate from 1995 to 1998. Interest in replenishing the SPR grew due to a reduction in the federal budget deficit and a drop in crude oil prices in 1999. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson's proposal for $100 million in the FY2000 budget for oil purchases was rejected. In FY2000, the proposal to include $100 million in the budget for oil purchases was rejected. Instead, the Department of Energy suggested accepting oil royalties from Gulf of Mexico leases \"in kind\" rather than as revenues. Despite initial resistance from the Department of the Interior, a plan was announced in February 1999. President Bush later ordered the fill of the SPR to 700 million barrels in 2001, primarily through oil acquired in this manner. President Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be filled to 700 million barrels through oil acquired as royalty-in-kind (RIK). The RIK plan initially received positive feedback but became controversial as crude prices rose in 2002. Some argued that diverting RIK oil to the SPR instead of selling it in the market was driving up prices. The Administration disagreed and legislative attempts to suspend RIK fill began in 2004. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Energy to develop procedures for filling the SPR considering various factors. The Department of Energy (DOE) issued a final rule on the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, considering parameters required by legislation. In 2007, DOE resumed filling the SPR with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. In 2008, Congress passed a law as gasoline prices rose, but DOE decided not to accept bids for additional RIK oil. Deliveries to the SPR totaled 140 million barrels by FY2007, with forgone receipts estimated at $4.6 billion. DOE projected deliveries of 19.1 million barrels of RIK oil in FY2008. Opponents of RIK fill in the 110th Congress were not necessarily opposed to the concept of an SPR, but objected to the government-owned strategic stock of petroleum, arguing it should be borne by the private sector. RIK fill resumed in 2009 and will end in early 2010, pending additional storage establishment. Expansion activities in Richton, MS, were considered, but expansion may not be a high priority despite a $25 million budget allocation in FY2010. The history of the SPR reflects differing opinions on what constitutes a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" The original intention of the SPR was to create a reserve of crude oil stocks for use in case of an interruption in supply. Recent increases in product prices and tight markets have led to debates on when to initiate a drawdown of the SPR. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to allow drawdowns in the event of a \"severe energy supply disruption,\" with a focus on price increases as a defining factor. The history of the SPR reflects differing opinions on what constitutes such an interruption. The debate over the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) drawdown plan was renewed by the rise in oil prices from 2005-2008. The Reagan Administration's plan in 1982 allowed for price-competitive sale of SPR oil without conditioning it on any trigger or formula. Many agreed that relying on the marketplace during shortages would have been less disruptive than regulations imposed in the 1970s. However, some argued that the SPR should be used to moderate price effects during shortages or tight inventories. In 1984, the Reagan Administration revised its position on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) drawdown, allowing for early use in case of disruption. This new policy aimed to ease congressional discontent and had international implications. The International Energy Agency agreed \"in principle\" to an early drawdown in response to pressure from the United States. The debate resurfaced after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, with concerns about a potential worldwide crude shortfall. During the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, there were debates on whether to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to mitigate anticipated price increases. The George H. W. Bush Administration initially decided against a drawdown of the SPR to lower prices without a physical shortage. However, some argued that perceived shortages can cause immediate damage and that releasing stockpiled oil to calm markets is beneficial. Eventually, in January 1991, President Bush authorized a drawdown of the SPR following the first air strike against Iraq. In 1991, President Bush authorized a drawdown of the SPR as crude prices dropped due to optimistic reports on the Iraqi air power. Despite criticism, 17.3 million barrels were sold from the SPR to settle markets during the Persian Gulf War. This experience led to legislation allowing the SPR to prevent minor shortages from escalating. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to prevent minor shortages from escalating into larger ones. The drawdown authority was broadened in the 102nd Congress to include instances where a reduction in supply could cause a major adverse impact on the national economy. Companies can borrow SPR crude through exchanges, with seven exchanges occurring between 1996 and 2005. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels of SPR oil in its FY1996 budget to help finance the program. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels of SPR oil in FY1996 to help finance the program. Three sales of SPR oil occurred during FY1996, totaling 28.1 million barrels and raising $544.7 million. The fill of the SPR with RIK oil was initiated to replace the volume sold. Growth in oil demand before Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita in 2005 began to strain U.S. refinery capacity, altering the historic correlation between crude oil and refined product prices. The correlation between crude oil and product prices shifted in the early 2000s due to pressure on product supplies and international tensions. The rise in crude prices in 2008 was driven by increasing international demand and concerns about production capacity. Markets were described as \"tight\" with little spare production capacity. During 2007-2008, refinery outages and weekly reports of U.S. crude and petroleum stocks influenced spikes in crude and product prices. Despite arguments that market conditions did not support high prices, significant and sustained increases were observed. Legislation in the Senate proposed a price basis for authorizing a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with some policymakers urging its release in 2008. A review of the oil market dynamics during this period demonstrates the impact on prices. In mid-July 2008, U.S. gasoline prices exceeded $4.00/gallon and diesel fuel averaged $4.75/gallon. Crude oil prices briefly surpassed $145/barrel but declined to less than $128/barrel. The price escalation was driven by factors like limited oil production capacity, inelastic demand, international tensions, and currency value fluctuations. Calls for a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) drawdown were made despite no discernible shortage. Legislation (H.R. 6578) for a 10% drawdown of SPR oil failed in the House. The proposal aimed to sell 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR within six months, with 20 million barrels to be sold in the first 60 days. The sale would be replaced with \"sour\" crude within five years. The idea stemmed from a GAO analysis noting the mismatch between oil grades in the SPR and refinery capabilities. Refiners reported potential penalties for using lighter crude in units designed for heavier grades. The agency reported that using lighter crude in units designed for heavy crudes could result in penalties of up to 11% in gasoline production and 35% in diesel production. Refiners indicated they may need to shut down some units. The impact of a 70 million barrel draw on the SPR on prices was uncertain. Oil companies may not be interested in SPR oil unless they have spare refining capacity or want to build crude oil stocks. Bids on SPR oil must be fair to the U.S. government. The effect of an SPR drawdown on oil prices in 2008 was unpredictable due to various factors. Factors affecting daily oil prices include the impact of a unilateral draw on U.S. stocks versus a coordinated international drawdown. There is concern that using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not have a significant effect on oil prices, potentially diminishing its leverage. In 2008, producing nations could argue that the market was well-supplied, questioning the need for SPR oil. Additionally, the SPR is seen as a defensive tool against high prices, but its effectiveness may diminish if not used strategically. During the winter of 1999-2000, concerns arose about low middle distillate stocks for home heating oil and diesel fuels, leading to the establishment of a Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) with $8 million in funding. The NHOR, located in New Haven, CT, Woodbridge, NJ, and Providence, RI, aims to provide 10 days of Northeast home heating oil demand. Controversy surrounded its potential use and impact on private markets. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established during the winter of 1999-2000 with $8 million in funding to address concerns about low middle distillate stocks for home heating oil and diesel fuels. The reserve was intended to be used in cases of regional supply shortages of significant scope and duration, or if the price differential between crude oil and home heating oil increased by more than 60% over its five-year rolling average for seven consecutive days. The goal was to set a high threshold for reserve use to avoid discouraging oil marketers and distributors from stockbuilding. In December 2000, the 60% differential was breached due to a decline in crude prices rather than a rise in home heating oil prices. During a general strike in Venezuela in late 2002, the United States experienced a loss of 1.5 million barrels of daily crude supply, leading to lower refinery utilization and reliance on refined product inventories for home heating oil during a cold winter. Despite calls for the use of the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) due to rising prices, the criteria for a drawdown were not met. Congress requested DOE to provide information on the circumstances for NHOR use, indicating dissatisfaction with the existing formula. The FY2004 Interior appropriations bill did not include this language. The bill S. 283 introduced in 2009 allows for a drawdown of the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve based on price and supply. If the average retail price for home heating oil in the Northeast exceeds $4.00 per gallon on November 1, 20% of the reserve will be released, with additional releases if the price remains high in subsequent months."
