The \"Truth in Regulating Act of 2000\" outlines findings that highlight the need for transparency in regulatory decisions and effective congressional oversight to ensure laws are implemented efficiently and fairly. The Act aims to increase accountability of Congress and agencies to the public they serve. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency,\" \"economically significant rule,\" and \"independent evaluation\" to ensure transparency and accountability in regulatory decisions. The Act defines key terms for transparency and accountability in regulatory decisions, including evaluating data, methodology, and assumptions to determine their impact on rulemaking conclusions. SEC. 4. REPORT ON RULES. When an agency publishes an economically significant rule, a committee member can request the Comptroller General to review it. The Comptroller General must submit a report on the rule to Congress within specific timeframes, including an independent evaluation. The Comptroller General conducts an independent evaluation of economically significant rules, assessing benefits, costs, alternative approaches, and regulatory impact. The Comptroller General evaluates economically significant rules, including regulatory impact analysis, federalism assessment, and implications of the results. Procedures are developed for determining the priority of review requests, giving highest priority to proposed rulemaking and interim final rulemaking. Each agency must cooperate with the Comptroller General for this Act, without expanding or limiting the General Accounting Office's authority. Authorization of appropriations for the General Accounting Office is set at $5,200,000 for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. The Act will take effect 180 days after enactment and will not apply to rules published 3 years after the effective date."
