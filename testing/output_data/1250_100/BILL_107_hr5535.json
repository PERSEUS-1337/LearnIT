The western basin of Lake Erie is crucial to the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes ecosystem, with a shift towards an ecosystem approach. The Great Lakes hold over 90% of the nation's surface freshwater, with the western basin primarily fed by the Detroit River. The western basin of Lake Erie is an important ecosystem with diverse plant and wildlife species, including marshes and wetlands that support dense populations. The area has a moderate climate and southern latitude, allowing for unique species not found in the northern Great Lakes. More than 300 plant species, including 37 significant ones, have been identified in the aquatic habitats of the western basin. The wetlands in the western basin of Lake Erie are crucial for waterfowl habitat, migration, nesting, and feeding. They serve as a major stopover for diving ducks during migration. Lake Erie is internationally recognized for its wildlife refuges, fishing, boating, birding, photography, and tourism, generating significant economic benefits. The western basin of Lake Erie in Ohio is home to a renowned walleye fishery, driving a $2 billion sport fishing industry. Coastal wetlands in the area have been under pressure for 150 years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today. The development of Monroe, Michigan has significantly impacted coastal wetlands along the Michigan shoreline. The development of Monroe, Michigan has significantly impacted the coastal wetlands at the mouth of the Raisin River. Only about 100 hectares remain unaltered today, compared to 70 years ago when marshes were 10 times larger. Stressors like sediment and nutrient loadings, contaminants, and exotic species have degraded the quality of remaining wetlands. Protective peninsula beach systems have eroded, exacerbating shoreline erosion and impacting breeding grounds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Refuge Complex\" as Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"International Refuge\" as Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The boundaries of the Refuge Complex in Ohio are expanded to include additional lands and waters, while the southern boundary of the International Refuge in Michigan is extended south. The Secretary has the authority to make boundary revisions as needed. The Secretary will keep the map available for inspection in appropriate offices of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. SEC. 5 allows the Secretary to acquire lands within the Refuge Complex through donation, purchase, or exchange with consent of the owner. Federal properties within the Complex can be transferred to the Secretary for administration purposes with concurrence from the respective agency heads. SEC. 6 addresses the administration of the Refuge Complex. The Secretary administers federally owned lands, waters, and interests within the Refuge Complex in accordance with relevant laws. The Complex is managed to provide habitats for migratory birds and wildlife, and to enhance resource conservation programs. The western basin of Lake Erie is being conserved and restored to enhance native aquatic and terrestrial communities. Partnerships are being formed to promote public awareness of the resources in the area and to advance collective goals established in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002. The Great Lakes conservation efforts involve various Federal agencies, State governments, and tribal governments working together to protect and restore the ecosystem. Priority public uses of the Refuge Complex include hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with Ohio or Michigan for non-Federal lands. The Secretary may enter into agreements with Ohio or Michigan for the management of lands within the Refuge Complex to promote public awareness and conservation efforts. The Secretary will encourage Ohio to use existing authorities for funding trails within the Complex. The Secretary will conduct a study of fish and wildlife habitat at dredge spoil disposal sites near the Maumee River. A report will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. Authorization of appropriations is granted for land acquisition, development, and maintenance of the Refuge Complex, as well as for the study under section 7."
