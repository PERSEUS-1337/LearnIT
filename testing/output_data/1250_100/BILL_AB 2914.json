    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12012.75 of the Government Code is amended to create the \"Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund\" in the State Treasury for receiving and depositing money from Indian tribes based on gaming compacts. The fund will be used by the California Gambling Control Commission to distribute funds to eligible recipient Indian tribes. Section 12012.90 is also amended to outline the application of funds for each fiscal year starting from 2016-17. The California Gambling Control Commission determines shortfalls in the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for each fiscal year and estimates the amount needed to transfer from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to backfill the Trust Fund. The transfer amount is based on the number of eligible recipient Indian tribes multiplied by $1,100,000, minus anticipated tribe contributions. The eligible recipient Indian tribe is defined as a noncompact, nongaming, or limited-gaming tribe based on actual payments received into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund the previous fiscal year, with adjustments for amendments to tribal-state gaming compacts. The Legislature will transfer funds from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for eligible recipient Indian tribes to receive up to $275,000 per quarter, totaling $1,100,000 for the fiscal year. Quarterly payments will be made within 45 days. Surplus funds will remain in the Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for future disbursement. Adjustments may be made to future distributions if necessary. If the appropriated amount for the fiscal year is insufficient to ensure each eligible recipient Indian tribe receives $275,000 per quarter, the Department of Finance will request a budget augmentation from the Legislature after consulting with the California Gambling Control Commission. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the California Gambling Control Commission's report will identify eligible recipient Indian tribes, the amount paid by each tribe into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, and the shortfall to be backfilled from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to ensure each tribe receives $275,000 per quarter."
