    "content": "On October 29, House and Senate appropriators announced a conference agreement on a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations and reconstruction assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was approved by the House and Senate and signed into law by the President on November 6. The conference agreement rejected a Senate proposal for Iraq reconstruction assistance to be provided as loans. Iraq provided details of its request for reconstruction aid, which was approved by the Senate on November 3. Congressional hearings were held on various issues raised by the request, with legislative proposals addressing costs, burden sharing, and other matters considered. The main debate in Congress was whether to provide reconstruction funds to Iraq as grants. The major issue in Congress was whether to provide Iraq reconstruction funds as grants or loans. The Administration requested $87 billion, with $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. Of the defense funds, $51.5 billion was for ongoing military operations in Iraq. The Administration requested $87 billion for Iraq, Afghanistan, and other activities, with $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs. The request aimed to cover pressing requirements through FY2004 and Iraq reconstruction through December 2004, assuming current troop levels and pace of operations would continue unchanged. Ongoing military costs after FY2004 were not addressed. The $20 billion requested for reconstruction and security in Iraq only covers a portion of the estimated $50-75 billion needed in the long run. The World Bank and UNDP estimate reconstruction costs at $36 billion over four years, with an additional $19.4 billion for security and critical sectors. Total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with $17.5 billion in 2004 alone. Iraqi oil revenues, recovered assets, and international support are expected to help meet remaining needs, but Iraqi oil revenues are projected to be around $12 billion in the next year. The request for $87 billion for defense and reconstruction assistance in Iraq comes on top of over $110 billion provided since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Congress has allocated $100 billion for defense funding for various military operations. Additionally, about $12 billion has been appropriated for Iraqi and Afghan reconstruction and foreign aid. The $87 billion request for defense and reconstruction assistance in Iraq is in addition to over $110 billion provided since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Congress has allocated $100 billion for defense funding for military operations, with an additional $12 billion for Iraqi and Afghan reconstruction and foreign aid. The debate in Congress focused on cost issues and the impact on the federal budget, accuracy of cost projections, and future costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mid-session review estimated a federal budget deficit of $455 billion in FY2003 and $475 billion in FY2004. White House officials projected a deficit of about $525 billion for FY2004 with additional appropriations. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected deficits of $401 billion in FY2003 and $480 billion in FY2004, including assumptions for future spending growth. Administration officials argued for the economy's ability to handle the deficits. Administration officials argued for the economy's ability to handle the deficits, with critics expressing concerns about the fiscal responsibility of borrowing 20%-25% of the federal budget. Some suggested financing reconstruction costs in Iraq through loans rather than grants to utilize future oil revenue for repayment. Leading up to the war, officials were hesitant to provide long-term cost estimates. The cost projections for the war in Iraq were a matter of contention in Congress, with initial estimates ranging from $50 billion to $200 billion. Some legislators accused the Administration of withholding cost projections to avoid weakening support for tax cut legislation. An amendment was even approved to set aside $100 billion of the tax cut as a hedge against unplanned war costs. An amendment was approved to set aside $100 billion of the tax cut as a hedge against unplanned war costs. Independent estimates projected higher war costs, including post-war expenses like peacekeeping and reconstruction. Estimates of reconstruction costs were a focus due to the Administration's request for $20 billion for Iraq. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz mentioned that Iraq's oil revenues could bring in $50-100 billion over the next few years. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld acknowledged underestimating Iraq reconstruction costs due to the damage caused by Saddam Hussein's regime. Questions remain about the accuracy of military and reconstruction cost projections. Cost projections for military operations in Iraq assume current force levels will be maintained for the next year. The need for additional U.S. troops is unlikely due to progress in organizing Iraqi security forces and expected contributions from other nations. Questions remain about the accuracy of the Defense Department's supplemental funding request, including whether the security situation is improving or worsening. Senator Harkin raised concerns about the necessity of certain war-related emergency projects in a Senate hearing. The Defense Department's funding request includes money for military construction, R&D projects, and base camp housing. Concerns have been raised about the lack of funding for Army \"resetting\" and the ability to maintain current force levels without extending reserve tours or mobilizing more reserves. Some members of Congress suggest increasing the size of the Army, but this would take time and cost billions annually. Officials acknowledge the need for reconstruction efforts. Officials underestimated Iraq's infrastructure weakness and overestimated short-term oil revenues. Uncertainty remains on reconstruction costs and donor contributions. $2 billion pledged for Iraq in 2004, with additional World Bank loans recommended. The House Budget Committee Democratic Staff projects long-term costs of the war in Iraq to exceed $400 billion, with uncertainties on the duration of U.S. military presence. Lt. Gen. Carlos Sanchez estimates it will be \"a few years\" before withdrawal from Iraq. The Vietnam War cost $584 billion in FY2003 prices. Legislative measures focused on oversight, taxes, funding for programs, health insurance for reservists, and Iraq reconstruction. Senator Feinstein introduced a bill for a report on Iraq's economic and security situation. The Senate and House proposed various reporting requirements on Iraq reconstruction efforts, including costs, security plans, international participation, and military personnel needs. Senator Biden suggested offsetting costs by delaying tax cuts for the top 1% of taxpayers. The Administration opposed offsetting tax cuts to free up $85 billion. Senator Biden and others proposed amendments to increase revenues, but they were rejected. Funding for domestic programs was a contentious issue, with criticism of prioritizing Iraq reconstruction over domestic needs. Senator Stabenow's amendment to reduce Iraq reconstruction funding was also rejected. The Senate rejected an amendment by Senator Stabenow to reduce Iraq reconstruction funding by $5 billion and transfer the money to domestic priorities. Various measures for funding domestic and international programs were debated in Congress, including additional funding for homeland security and AmeriCorps. An amendment by Senator Durbin to add $880 million for international HIV/AIDS was tabled by the Senate. The House added $345 million for Liberia peacekeeping and reconstruction and for Sudan. The Senate included $200 million for Liberia, while the enacted bill provided $200 million plus $245 million for a contribution to U.N. peacekeeping operations in Liberia. There was a debate on whether to add $1.4 billion for veterans health benefits. The Senate approved an amendment to the FY2004 defense authorization bill to offer health insurance to non-active duty reservists and their families through the DOD TRICARE program. The provision would cost about $500 million in FY2004 and over $2 billion a year by FY2008. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if it included this provision. On October 2, the Senate approved an amendment to its version of the supplemental bill providing health insurance to non-activated reservists who are unemployed or ineligible for employer-provided insurance. Several legislators addressed the issue of excessive profits earned by companies like Halliburton in non-competitive contracts for U.S. forces and Iraq reconstruction. Various measures were proposed, including the Clean Contracting in Iraq Act of 2003 and amendments to stiffen penalties for fraud and profiteering. The enacted legislation included provisions to limit non-competitive procedures for reconstruction contracts and require oil infrastructure procurement to follow normal competitive bidding procedures. Members also drafted amendments to guarantee portions of the $20.3 billion Iraq reconstruction request by Iraqi oil or as loans. The $20.3 billion Iraq reconstruction request may be guaranteed by Iraqi oil or extended as loans instead of grants. Senate passed an amendment converting $10 billion to loans, to be treated as grants if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Various unsuccessful attempts were made to shift grants to loans, including creating an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority. Representative Wamp proposed a plan but withdrew it under White House pressure. Representative Wamp offered a proposal during House Committee markup to make half of the reconstruction funds available only after an elected government was in place and on a loan basis, but withdrew it under White House pressure. Senator Hutchison and others introduced an amendment to direct $10 billion to an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund within the World Bank for economic development projects in Iraq, with concerns raised about increasing Iraq's debt. The Senate and House approved a bill providing funds for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President signed the bill into law on November 6 as P.L. 108-106, with amounts requested for defense and foreign operations. The bill provided $65.560 billion for defense, making minor changes in equipment funding and rejecting a proposal to revise military personnel benefits. The Senate committee bill extended increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowances through FY2004. An additional $962 million was allocated for Army operations and maintenance, including funding for body armor, battlefield cleanup, and communications equipment. The Defense Department was given authority to transfer up to $2.5 billion. The Defense Department was provided with the authority to transfer up to $2.5 billion among defense accounts without advance congressional approval. Additionally, the bill allowed for an additional $5 billion transfer subject to approval by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Senator Byrd proposed measures to limit funding flexibility and allocated $150 million for unplanned military construction projects. $200 million was provided for training and equipment for the Iraqi and Afghan armies, while $1.0 billion was allocated for coalition support. The committee debated reconstruction funds and rejected an amendment to eliminate most of the reconstruction funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected an amendment to eliminate most of the reconstruction funds for Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving reconstruction to be considered later. They supported the total funding request of $20.3 billion for Iraq reconstruction and provided flexibility for resource allocation. The $60.5 million requested for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq was deleted from the Senate-reported measure. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected an amendment to eliminate most of the reconstruction funds for Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving reconstruction to be considered later. They supported the total funding request of $20.3 billion for Iraq reconstruction and provided flexibility for resource allocation. S. 1689 provided a separate $60.5 million appropriation for USAID's Capital Investment Fund to meet the requirements in Afghanistan, making the FY2003 supplemental funds available for U.S. facilities in Baghdad. Other additions and changes made by the Senate panel included earmarking $100 million for democracy-building activities in Iraq, applying USAID standards for disabled persons, ensuring religious freedom in the new Iraqi constitution, prohibiting funds for Saddam Hussein's debts, and imposing penalties for war profiteering and fraud in Iraq. During Committee markup, two amendments by Senator Dorgan related to reducing U.S. costs of rebuilding Iraq were tabled. The first proposed creating an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority using future Iraq oil revenues for financing, while the second aimed to convert reconstruction grants to loans. Another proposal by Senator Harkin to reduce reconstruction funds to $10 billion and delay additional requests was also tabled. The Senate approved a $100 million emergency fund for global crises, including peace and humanitarian efforts in Liberia. Additionally, $200 million was authorized for Pakistan debt relief and foreign aid restrictions were waived. $41 million was allocated for various purposes such as reimbursing New York City for protecting foreign missions post-9/11. USAID received $40 million for operating expenses in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an extra $60.5 million for construction and upgrades. The Senate debated amendments on the floor regarding Iraq reconstruction funding, including proposals to review the funding more closely, suspend tax reductions to cover costs, and offer health insurance to reservists and their families. Amendments to provide Iraq reconstruction funds as loans were also considered. The Senate debated various amendments on Iraq reconstruction funding, including proposals to cut specific projects, reduce funds for Iraqi oil imports, and allocate funds for HIV/AIDS prevention. There was also discussion on whether reconstruction funds should be provided as loans. The Senate adopted an amendment to provide $10 billion in loans to Iraq, with the possibility of converting them into grants if international creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Another proposal for an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund was discussed, which would be governed by a Board of Trustees to extend loans and loan guarantees for economic development projects in Iraq. The Trust Fund would receive $10 billion out of the $20.3 billion appropriated for Iraq reconstruction. The Senate discussed proposals for Iraq reconstruction, including a $10 billion loan that could be converted to grants if international creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Another proposal was for an Iraq Reconstruction Trust Fund to provide loans and guarantees for economic projects. Amendments were adopted during the seven days of debate, with 47 adopted and 16 rejected. The Senate adopted several amendments related to Iraq reconstruction, including requirements for competitive procedures in contracts over $1 million, prioritizing women's issues in reconstruction programs, a report on increasing contributions for Iraq reconstruction, offering health insurance to reservists and their families, and increasing funding for up-armored vehicles. The Senate adopted several amendments related to Iraq reconstruction, including increasing funds for up-armored vehicles and addressing various issues such as foreign debts, POW damages, military equipment exports, National Guard assistance, defense facilities, military personnel leave, and federal government obligations. Several Senate amendments were approved, including providing financial support for federal employees who are military reserves activated for service, retroactive relief for hospitalized members of the uniformed services from paying for food while hospitalized, cutting funds from Iraq construction projects and oil imports, allocating additional funds for assistance to Liberia, funding conflict resolution and democracy activities, and prioritizing the equipping of aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for homeland security measures. The Senate approved several amendments, including additional funding for medical care for veterans, requiring reports on Iraq reconstruction and security, and rejecting amendments related to the Coalition Provisional Authority and safety equipment for US forces in Iraq. Senator Bingaman's amendment to award the Iraqi Liberation Medal was also rejected. Senator Stabenow proposed reducing Iraq reconstruction funds and increasing spending elsewhere. The Senate approved various amendments, including increasing funds for domestic programs and setting conditions for Iraq reconstruction funds. Senator proposals included using Iraqi oil revenues for reconstruction, limiting the use of non-security funds, prohibiting contracts with certain corporations, and establishing an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority. Senator Durbin also suggested reducing Iraq reconstruction funds by $879 million. The Senate approved amendments to shift funds from Iraq reconstruction to domestic programs, establish a National Commission on Intelligence Related to Iraq, and prohibit involuntary deployment for National Guard and Reserves. Senator proposals included reducing Iraq reconstruction funds by $879 million and eliminating the President's flexibility to reallocate funds without Congress approval. The Senate approved amendments to shift funds from Iraq reconstruction to other countries, such as Afghanistan and Liberia, and to increase funding for the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps. Additionally, amendments were made regarding military retired pay and veterans administration disability benefits. The House marked up a supplemental appropriations bill providing $86.9 billion in total, $184 million below the request, with $18.65 billion allocated for Iraq. The House marked up a supplemental appropriations bill providing $86.9 billion in total, $184 million below the request; $18.65 billion for Iraq reconstruction, $1.65 billion below the request; $1.2 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction, $400 million above the request; transferred funds for operating expenses of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and Hurricane Isabel damage at military facilities; added funds for force protection and unexploded ordnance clearing in the defense part of the bill; allowed the Army to contract out for security guards at military facilities in the United States; extended increases in Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowances through FY2004; provided the Defense Department with the authority to transfer up to $3.0 billion among defense accounts. The House marked up a supplemental appropriations bill providing $86.9 billion in total, $184 million below the request; $18.65 billion for Iraq reconstruction, $1.65 billion below the request; $1.2 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction, $400 million above the request; transferred funds for operating expenses of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and Hurricane Isabel damage at military facilities; added funds for force protection and unexploded ordnance clearing in the defense part of the bill; allowed the Army to contract out for security guards at military facilities in the United States; extended increases in Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowances through FY2004; provided the Defense Department with the authority to transfer up to $3.0 billion among defense accounts. The Department was authorized to transfer up to $3.0 billion among defense accounts without advance congressional approval rather than $5 billion as requested by the Administration. Additionally, $100 million was allocated for training and equipment for the new Iraqi Army and the Afghan National Army, and $1.3 billion was provided for \"coalition support\" to reimburse Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating nations for logistical and other support to U.S. operations. The House marked up a supplemental appropriations bill providing $86.9 billion in total, $184 million below the request; $18.65 billion for Iraq reconstruction, $1.65 billion below the request; $1.2 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction, $400 million above the request; transferred funds for operating expenses of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and Hurricane Isabel damage at military facilities; added funds for force protection and unexploded ordnance clearing in the defense part of the bill; allowed the Army to contract out for security guards at military facilities in the United States; extended increases in Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowances through FY2004; provided the Defense Department with the authority to transfer up to $3.0 billion among defense accounts. The Department was authorized to transfer up to $3.0 billion among defense accounts without advance congressional approval rather than $5 billion as requested by the Administration. Additionally, $100 million was allocated for training and equipment for the new Iraqi Army and the Afghan National Army, and $1.3 billion was provided for \"coalition support\" to reimburse Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating nations for logistical and other support to U.S. operations. The House also made adjustments to the Iraq reconstruction funding, reducing funds for various projects and increasing funding for security, law enforcement, infrastructure, medical facilities, and education programs. Funding for Afghan reconstruction was increased with additional resources for road construction, private sector development, power generation, education, and improved governance. The House Committee bill for Iraq and Afghan reconstruction included provisions for Pakistan debt reduction, humanitarian aid for Liberia, funding for a U.N. peacekeeping force, disaster relief in Sudan, and $15 million for the September 11 Victims Compensation Program. The committee agreed to a manager's amendment adding $150 million for Hurricane Isabel storm damage at military and Coast Guard facilities, totaling $544 million. They also prohibited the use of funds for defense or reconstruction activities coordinated by unconfirmed US government officers. Other accepted amendments included requiring quarterly reports on reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq and a review by the General Accounting Office on reconstruction efforts. The House committee accepted several amendments, including shifting $90 million to education, ensuring impact aid for deployed parents, strengthening competitive bidding requirements, prohibiting funding for foreign military units violating human rights, allocating 10% of funds to small businesses, analyzing alternatives for replacing KC-135 tanker aircraft, and addressing repatriation of illegal immigrants. The Nethercutt amendment on tanker aircraft concerns a proposal to lease Boeing 767s currently delayed. The House committee accepted amendments including shifting funds to education, strengthening competitive bidding, and addressing repatriation of illegal immigrants. The Senate removed a provision for leasing Boeing 767 aircraft as tankers. Representative Obey's amendment to transfer funds from Iraq reconstruction to defense was rejected. Representative Wamp and Culberson withdrew amendments related to providing reconstruction money for Iraq as loans and ensuring reimbursement for the reconstruction. The House committee rejected various proposed amendments, including eliminating Iraq reconstruction funds, adding funds for Liberia, requiring information on non-competitive contracts in Iraq, and buying Boeing 767 tanker aircraft. The Rules Committee approved unlimited amendments but did not protect them against points of order, leading to some amendments being ruled out of order. Representative Obey's proposal to convert reconstruction grants to loans was the only loan-related amendment allowed for debate. The House adopted several amendments, including exempting servicemembers with combat-related injuries from meal requirements while hospitalized, allocating $20 million for women and girls in Afghanistan, tightening reporting requirements for non-competitive contracts, prohibiting Iraq from participating in OPEC, transferring funds to the Family Advocacy Program, providing funds for domestic travel for Army personnel on rest and recuperation leave, and adding reporting requirements on international military activities. The House rejected various proposed amendments, including converting reconstruction grants to loans, shifting funds from Iraq reconstruction to military programs, deleting funding for Liberia, shifting reconstruction funds from Iraq to Afghanistan, reducing reconstruction aid for Iraq, limiting the Defense Department's authority to transfer funds, barring funds for petroleum imports into Iraq, and transferring funds from weapons inspections to Army force protection measures. The House rejected various proposed amendments, including shifting funds from Iraq reconstruction to military programs, reducing reconstruction aid for Iraq, and prohibiting funds for assistance to certain countries. The House approved a motion to instruct House conferees to accept Senate provisions regarding medical screening for military reservists, extending health care benefits for military personnel, allocating funds for Iraq reconstruction as loans, and providing funds for veterans' health care. The President's advisors threatened a veto if the bill included these provisions. The House-Senate conference considered providing health insurance for non-deployed military reservists and their dependents through the DOD TRICARE program. The conference rejected a proposal to allocate half of the $18 billion for Iraq reconstruction as loans. Other key decisions included $500 million for FEMA disaster relief, eliminating a House provision for Iraq aid coordination, and cutting the Administration's request for Iraq Relief and Reconstruction by $1.655 billion. The House-Senate conference report directs $210 million of Iraq funding to aid Jordan, Liberia, and Sudan, reducing resources for Iraq by $1.865 billion. It provides $1.2 billion for Afghan reconstruction, $245 million for U.N. peacekeeping in Liberia, $200 million for Liberian relief aid, $10 million for Sudan humanitarian assistance, and $200 million in economic aid to Pakistan. It includes a one-year trial for health insurance through DOD TRICARE for non-active duty reservists and rejects a Senate provision to increase Army end-strength by 10,000 personnel. The House-Senate conference report rejects a Senate provision to increase Army end-strength by 10,000 personnel and provides funding for various military and disaster repair projects, including munitions security in Iraq. It also reallocates funds for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and grants transfer authority to the Secretary of Defense. The House-Senate conference report rejected a Senate provision to increase Army end-strength by 10,000 personnel and provided funding for military and disaster repair projects. The Administration proposed $66 billion for military and intelligence operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with the Senate Appropriations Committee fully funding defense and the House Appropriations Committee cutting $289 million from the defense total. Congressional action on FY2004 Supplemental Appropriations for the Department included compromise language on reporting requirements and competition on contracts in Iraq. The FY2004 Supplemental Appropriations for the Department of Defense were based on maintaining current force levels and operations, with a shift in active and reserve forces. The request also utilized the \"Contingency Operations Support Tool\" model for cost estimation. The number of Army combat divisions in Iraq was expected to decrease, but total personnel deployed in Southwest Asia would remain stable. The Defense Department utilized the COST model to project costs of operations in the late 1990s. The model provides detailed breakdowns of projected costs based on historical data, though actual expenses may vary. Congress questions why the Department did not provide COST model figures before the war, suggesting estimates were not available until a final decision was made. The Defense Department's new cost estimates for war appear higher than previous estimates. There is ongoing debate between the Administration and Congress regarding the flexibility of reallocating funds for the Department of Defense. The FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental proposed a flexible transfer account called the Iraq Freedom Fund, with Congress agreeing to provide $15.7 billion. The Defense Department requested $2.0 billion for the Iraq Freedom Fund in the new budget, with the rest in regular appropriations accounts. The Defense Department requested authority to transfer $5 billion between appropriations accounts, with notification to Congress within five days. They also requested $500 million for a contingency construction account. This reintroduces a controversial issue in Congress. The Defense Department requested $200 million for training and equipping military forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other regional nations for counter-terrorism operations. Congress has approved funding for coalition support but rejected requests for DOD-run military assistance programs. The Administration requested $200 million for training and equipping military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Congress did not approve the request in the FY2004 defense authorization or appropriations bills. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to provide $200 million for the new Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army, while the House provided $100 million. Congress also increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance in the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental, which expired at the end of FY2003. The benefits were extended through October 31, 2003, in the first continuing resolution for FY2004. The House and Senate differ on extending benefits in the FY2004 defense bill. The Defense Department wants to replace Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance with $225 Hardship Duty Pay for troops in combat zones. Both House and Senate committees extended the benefits through FY2004. The Senate debated providing health insurance for non-deployed military reservists. The Senate approved an amendment to provide health insurance for non-deployed military reservists through the TRICARE program, with a co-payment requirement. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if this provision is included. The Daschle-Graham amendment offers health insurance to reservists receiving unemployment compensation or without employer-sponsored insurance, with a 28% co-payment. This amendment is more limited and targeted compared to the Senate provision in the FY2004 defense authorization bill. The Administration requested $21.44 billion in FY2004 for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan and other foreign policy programs related to the global war on terrorism. $20.4 billion would be allocated for Iraq, with additional funds requested for urgent needs in Afghanistan. Congress had previously appropriated $9.6 billion in FY2003 for similar activities. The pending FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriation bill was considering funding requests totaling roughly $4.9 billion. The Senate bill appropriated funds for USAID in Afghanistan separately, making funds available for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Baghdad without new appropriations. The House bill and conference agreement provided $35.8 million for a new U.S. mission in Iraq and specified peacekeeping funds for both Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration reprogrammed $390 million for Afghan reconstruction and $40 million for USAID operating expenses in Afghanistan. The House bill allocated $100 million for disaster and famine relief aid for Liberia and Sudan, while the Senate bill provided $200 million in the Emergency Crises Fund. The Senate bill allocated $200 million in the Emergency Crises Fund for Liberia and Sudan. The conference agreement provided $210 million for the two countries, drawn from different accounts. Additionally, funding was proposed for security operations in Afghanistan and to cover a shortfall in Machine Readable Visa fees. The House bill allocated $156.3 million for consular services, including MRV fees. The conference agreement allocated $156.3 million in the D&CS account, with funds designated for MRV fees, security measures in Afghanistan, and a diplomatic mission in Iraq. Additionally, $115.5 million was provided for Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Services, including rewards and costs for protecting foreign missions and officials. The Administration requested $200 million for debt reduction in Pakistan from Economic Support Funds, which was included in the conference agreement. The supplemental request for reconstruction and security in Iraq totaled $20.3 billion, a significant increase from previous appropriations. The United States had committed $4.1 billion to reconstruction in Iraq, with $2.5 billion from an Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The new request aimed to address security and infrastructure concerns, with over $5 billion for security capabilities and the rest for infrastructure improvements like electricity, oil, water, transportation, and healthcare. The Administration requested $300 million for private sector growth and job training in Iraq. The House bill excluded funding for Iraq traffic police and two prisons, while reducing funding for the National Security Communications Network. Other concerns like government reform, agriculture, economic development, and education were not included in the request. Total reconstruction requirements were not fully addressed by the investments made in hospitals and health clinics. The conference agreement reduced funding for various projects including prisons, electric generation, emergency oil supplies, water services, solid waste management, environmental restoration, telephone numbering system, postal information architecture, housing communities, and a children's hospital in Basra. The Bush Administration's key policy objectives in Iraq included restoring basic human services and rebuilding the economy and political structure. The Coalition Provisional Authority, led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, aimed to establish Iraqi self-rule through the Iraqi Governing Council and local councils. Since the U.S. occupation began in April, progress has been made in reconstituting civil and economic institutions, running local affairs, and providing basic services like schools, hospitals, and food through the oil-for-food program. However, challenges remain in restoring infrastructure, security, and introducing political and economic reforms in a timely manner. The lack of visible progress in these areas could lead to political discontent and opposition. The $20.3 billion supplemental request aimed to address infrastructure and security needs in Iraq. A national budget announced by the CPA estimated expenditures of $6.1 billion, with the remaining deficit of $4.3 billion to be covered by various sources including frozen assets and U.S. assistance. The Administration requested greater outlays of revenue for Iraq's immediate reconstruction needs. The supplemental reconstruction request for Iraq exceeded initial revenue projections, with uncertainties surrounding oil export production and donor contributions. The World Bank and U.N. Development Program estimated Iraq's reconstruction needs at $36 billion over four years, excluding an additional $19.4 billion estimated by the CPA. The Bank/UNDP report estimated Iraq's reconstruction needs at $36 billion over four years, excluding $19.4 billion for security and critical sectors. The total projected costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with concerns about funding shortages and Iraq's capacity to absorb infrastructure commitments. The Administration's request for infrastructure was $12.4 billion, but OMB confirmed it was intended to cover 18 months. The World Bank assessment projects that power and water needs in Iraq will be met for at least 18 months, with oil revenues expected to play a significant role in financing reconstruction efforts. Current oil production levels are close to 2 million barrels per day, with potential for reaching 2.8 million barrels per day in the future. The Administration's budget calculations assume an average production of 2 million barrels per day over the next 12 months. The Administration's budget calculations assume an average production of 2 million barrels per day over the next 12 months, generating about $12 billion in revenues. Roughly $503 million has already been allocated for repair of oil facilities. The request for FY2004 supplemental was $2.1 billion for oil facility restoration. Loans vs. Grants for Reconstruction were debated, with some arguing that Iraq's future oil revenues could service debt for infrastructure rebuilding. The Administration proposed offering the $20.3 billion supplemental as grants to reduce reconstruction costs to the United States. Iraq owes roughly $200 billion in pre-war debts, and G7 leaders agreed to suspend Iraq's debt servicing through 2004. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 protects Iraqi oil exports from creditor attachment until 2007. The question remains on who could assume responsibility for new sovereign debt, with the possibility of the World Bank managing an Iraq reconstruction trust fund. The World Bank may manage an Iraq reconstruction trust fund, but there is uncertainty about who would assume responsibility for new sovereign debt. Legal scholars debate whether the Coalition Provisional Authority has the authority to incur new debts on behalf of Iraq. Congressional appropriation would be necessary for loan reconstruction assistance under the 1990 Credit Reform Act. The appropriation for Iraq reconstruction is influenced by factors such as loan terms, repayment likelihood, and subsidy needs due to economic uncertainty. Lawmakers considered converting reconstruction grants to loans, using Iraqi oil for financing, and establishing a Trust Fund, but these proposals were ultimately rejected. The House considered various amendments to the $10 billion reconstruction supplemental, including withholding funds until after the election of a new Iraqi leader and transferring funds to a World Bank-administered loan facility. The impact of the supplemental on other donors was also discussed, with some believing that a large U.S. aid pledge could influence contributions at a donors' conference. Opponents of U.S. aid in the form of loans feared it could lead to other donors offering loans instead of grants, increasing Iraq's debt. The supplemental focused on infrastructure and security, areas less likely to receive support from other donors. Donors were hesitant to provide assistance due to concerns about supporting U.S. policy unilaterally. To address this, creating Iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the U.N. or World Bank was discussed at a meeting in Brussels. Control over fund usage was a key factor for donors. The management of Iraq reconstruction funds was a significant issue during congressional debate. The White House wanted to maintain flexibility over the distribution of resources, allowing the President to transfer funding to the Defense Department. This proposal sparked controversy, with critics arguing that aid programs should remain under traditional foreign assistance management agencies. The White House faced criticism from Members of Congress over the management of Iraq reconstruction funds, with debates on whether control should remain with the State Department or be transferred to the Pentagon. Ultimately, Congress agreed to allow the White House to allocate resources among five agencies, including the Department of Defense. Funds were managed by L. Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, under DOD guidance. The Administration initially proposed placing the entire $20.3 billion in the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, but later established the Iraq Stabilization Group to expedite reconstruction efforts. The White House faced criticism over Iraq reconstruction funds management. Congress debated control between State Department and Pentagon. Funds managed by L. Paul Bremer under DOD guidance. State Department staff in Iraq expected to double. Senate tabled amendment to place CPA under State Department. House bill added provision for coordination oversight. National Security Council Advisor Rice's role questioned. The White House faced criticism over Iraq reconstruction funds management. Advisor Rice coordinates reconstruction efforts, not subject to confirmation or congressional testimony.
