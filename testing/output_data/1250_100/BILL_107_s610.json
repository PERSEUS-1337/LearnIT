    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that decommissioned firearms sold by law enforcement agencies have been used in numerous crimes, including homicides, assaults, and drug-related offenses. Additionally, firearms stolen during shipment from police departments have been linked to criminal activities. State and local law enforcement departments also resell confiscated firearms, including assault weapons, that were involved in crimes prior to the restrictions imposed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Enforcement Act of 1994 aims to reduce firearms on the streets by helping law enforcement agencies stop transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals. Law enforcement departments in New York, Georgia, Chicago, and other localities have started destroying decommissioned firearms. The Attorney General may grant funds to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms, with the condition that decommissioned firearms are not transferred to individuals except for law enforcement agencies. Funds must be used solely for purchasing new firearms. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The Attorney General will establish regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment, outlining application requirements. SEC. 6.
