    "content": "The proposed generative model architecture aims to learn image representations that separate object identity from attributes, allowing for manipulation of specific attributes without changing the object's identity. This approach is successful in synthesizing images with and without chosen attributes, demonstrating competitive performance on facial attribute classification tasks. Latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs learn a mapping from latent encoding space to data space, often organized linearly. Directions in latent space correspond to attribute changes, useful for image synthesis and editing. Research includes class conditional image synthesis for specific object categories. The text discusses the use of latent space generative models for synthesizing images and manipulating image attributes. Unlike fine-grain synthesis, the focus is on changing specific attributes of an image while keeping other elements similar. This poses a more challenging problem as it requires learning a latent space representation that can separate different attributes in order to synthesize similar images with only one attribute changed. The paper proposes a new model for learning a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. It applies this model to the CelebA BID21 dataset and achieves competitive classification scores. The model's latent variable generative model successfully edits the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow synthesis of novel data samples from latent encodings. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x). The encoder predicts \u00b5 and \u03c3 for a given input x, and a latent sample is drawn from the encoder. KL-divergence can be calculated analytically with a multivariate Gaussian prior. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) offer different approaches for synthesizing data samples. VAE uses an encoder and decoder to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x), while GAN consists of a generator and discriminator trained in a mini-max game. GANs can produce sharper images compared to VAEs, as they involve two networks classifying samples as 'fake' or 'real'. The generator in a GAN is trained to synthesize samples that confuse the discriminator, aiming to create samples indistinguishable from real ones. While the vanilla GAN lacks a straightforward method to map data samples to latent space, a combination of VAE and GAN allows for faithful reconstruction of data samples. This alternative latent generative model involves using VAE to learn encoding and decoding processes, with a discriminator placed after the decoder. The combination of VAE and GAN involves learning an encoding and decoding process, with a discriminator ensuring data sample quality. Suggestions on combining VAEs and GANs for attribute editing have been made, but none are specifically designed for this purpose. Vanilla VAE and GAN samples depend on latent variable z drawn from a random distribution, while conditional VAEs and GANs allow for class-specific data synthesis. Autoencoders can be augmented for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to encoder and decoder inputs. Incorporating attribute information in conditional VAEs can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. Modifying the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector may not result in the intended changes, especially when editing specific attributes. The proposed process 'Adversarial Information Factorization' aims to separate information about attributes from a latent vector by involving a mini-max optimization with an encoder and an auxiliary network. This process addresses the issue of attribute information being partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute vector. The proposed process 'Adversarial Information Factorization' involves training an auxiliary network to predict the desired attribute from the latent encoding, while updating the VAE encoder to output values that prevent accurate prediction. This method aims to separate attribute information from the latent vector in a VAE-GAN architecture. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and an auxiliary network for attribute manipulation. The encoder also functions as a classifier, outputting attribute and latent vectors. Parameters of the decoder are updated using a binary cross-entropy loss function. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training the encoder for attribute manipulation. The current work introduces an adversarial information factorization model with a VAE core. It includes an encoder, decoder, and auxiliary network for attribute manipulation. A GAN architecture can be incorporated by adding a discriminator after the encoder. In contrast, previous work like cVAE-GAN lacks an auxiliary network for information factorization and only predicts a label for the reconstructed image. The encoder is updated to prevent attribute information from being encoded in the latent vector. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN model introduces a training procedure where the encoder is updated to prevent attribute information from being encoded in the latent vector. Attribute manipulation is achieved by encoding the image, appending the desired attribute label, and passing it through the decoder for synthesis. The model allows for simple 'switch flipping' operations in the representation space to manipulate attributes like 'Smiling' and 'Not Smiling'. Both quantitative and qualitative results are presented to evaluate the proposed model. The study involves training data output of an auxiliary network to calculate updates and perform facial attribute classification using a DCGAN architecture. Residual layers are incorporated to achieve competitive results compared to a state-of-the-art model. The model is evaluated qualitatively for image attribute editing, using residual networks for classification and visual quality improvement. Two types of cVAE-GAN models are discussed: a naive cVAE-GAN and an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN. Image attribute manipulation is quantified by reconstruction quality and the proportion of edited attributes. The study involves training an auxiliary network to perform facial attribute classification using a DCGAN architecture. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function is crucial for attribute editing. The study explores the impact of different loss functions on attribute editing in a facial image generation model. Including a classification loss on reconstructed samples does not significantly improve attribute editing performance. The IcGAN model, similar to the proposed model without certain losses, achieves comparable reconstruction error but performs less effectively in attribute editing tasks. The model proposed in the study focuses on learning a representation for faces that separates the identity of a person from specific facial attributes. By minimizing mutual information between identity and attributes, the model aims to classify facial attributes effectively. Results show that the model's performance in facial attribute classification is competitive with a state-of-the-art classifier. The study's model effectively separates identity from facial attributes, demonstrating competitive performance in attribute classification. The model focuses on attribute manipulation, showcasing challenges in editing desired attributes in images. The need for models that learn a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction is highlighted. The study introduces a model that focuses on attribute manipulation in images, achieving good reconstruction quality while separating identity from facial attributes. The model successfully synthesizes images with desired attributes, such as 'Not Smiling', with a 98% success rate. The model, IFcVAE-GAN, can synthesize images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute at a 98% success rate, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN. The model demonstrates high-quality reconstructions for attribute editing tasks, showing superiority over other conditional models. Comparisons with the naive cVAE-GAN show that both models achieve similar reconstruction errors, but only IFcVAE-GAN can generate images without smiles. The IFcVAE-GAN model can achieve high-quality reconstruction and attribute editing tasks by factorizing attribute information from the encoded latent representation. The model uses adversarial training with an auxiliary classifier to extract attribute labels, resulting in competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. The BID16 and BID4 models incorporate factorization techniques into the latent space, with BID4 proposing a method for predicting mutual information. In contrast, our model minimizes mutual information through adversarial information factorization. Our work is similar to the cVAE-GAN architecture, which focuses on synthesizing samples of a particular class, while our objective is to manipulate specific attributes within a class. Our model focuses on attribute editing in images, emphasizing the need to factor label information out of the latent encoding for successful editing. This differs from category conditional image synthesis models, highlighting the importance of targeted changes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. In this paper, the focus is on latent space generative models for attribute editing in images. By factorizing in the latent space, a single generative model can edit attributes by changing a single unit of the encoding. This approach differs from image-to-image models and requires fewer resources. The use of labeled data to learn representations is acknowledged, but there are also models that learn factored representations from unlabeled data. In this paper, a novel approach to learning representations of images is proposed, allowing for attribute modification without affecting the object's identity. The model factors the latent space using a mini-max objective, enabling the editing of specific attributes like a person's smile on a human face image. This method is demonstrated on human faces but can be applied to other objects as well. Our proposed model, Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, encourages attribute information to be separated from identity representation through adversarial learning. It accurately captures identity and allows for easy attribute editing without affecting identity. The model outperforms existing models for image synthesis and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in facial attribute classification. This novel approach to learning factored representations for images is a significant contribution to representation learning. The study demonstrates the importance of L aux loss in the architecture used by BID3 and TAB1. Results show that increased regularization reduces reconstruction quality, with no significant benefit from using the L class loss. Models without L KL and L gan show that small amounts of KL regularization are necessary for good reconstruction, but result in blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can accurately edit attributes but with poor visual quality, highlighting the main contribution of the work in learning factored representations. Several models, including variational autoencoder variants, learn disentangled representations from unlabelled data. The performance of these models can be evaluated by training a linear classifier on latent encodings for facial attribute classification. DIP-VAE is noted as one of the best models for learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data."
