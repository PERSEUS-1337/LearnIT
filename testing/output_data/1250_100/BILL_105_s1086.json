    "content": "The \"Hong Kong Reversion Act\" aims to support Hong Kong's autonomous governance and well-being after its reversion to China in 1997. It outlines circumstances for the US President to modify laws if China fails to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy. The Congress findings highlight the binding international agreement between the UK and China regarding the reversion of Hong Kong in 1997. China pledged autonomy, human rights, and elections for Hong Kong. Despite the promise of autonomy and respect for basic rights in Hong Kong under the \"one country, two systems\" policy, there have been official acts by the Government of China that threaten the region's autonomy. These acts include attempts to obtain confidential files on civil servants and dissolve the democratically elected Legislative Council. The appointment of a provisional legislature in December 1996, delineation of permitted speech and association by the Government of China post-reversion, initial warnings to religious institutions, and the decision to repeal or amend certain Hong Kong ordinances by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in February 1997. Despite commitments in the Joint Declaration, official acts by the UK Government threaten Hong Kong's autonomy. The official acts of the UK Government have damaged Hong Kong's future autonomy, including agreements violating the Joint Declaration. The reversion of Hong Kong to China has implications for US national interests and the rights of the Hong Kong people. The US has a responsibility to protect its interests and ensure human rights are upheld. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 ensures the continuity of US laws regarding Hong Kong's special status as a Special Administrative Region of China. The Act allows the President to modify the application of US laws if Hong Kong is not sufficiently autonomous. One of Congress's main purposes in enacting the Act was to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 aims to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy by treating it as a separate legal entity from China. The Act requires the Secretary of State to assess the implementation of the Joint Declaration, emphasizing that Hong Kong's future depends on China's commitment to upholding freedoms and allowing self-governance. SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS. Congress makes the following declarations regarding the close relationship between the United States and Hong Kong, urging cooperation and respect for Hong Kong's autonomy, especially in terms of customs territory and naval visits. China to consider United States requests for port calls at Hong Kong. The US emphasizes the importance of a free press and access to information for Hong Kong's economic success. Congress declares that elections in Hong Kong should be fair and in accordance with laws approved by the people. The Joint Declaration requires the legislature in Hong Kong to be representative. The United States urges China to honor the Joint Declaration by ensuring Hong Kong has an elected legislature. It emphasizes the importance of preserving essential rights and freedoms for the Hong Kong people, calling for revisions of Hong Kong law to be left to a democratically-elected legislature. The United States welcomes the Chief Executive-designate of Hong Kong's commitment to public consultation on new legislation replacing sections of existing laws. It urges that the new legislation should reflect the wishes of the people of Hong Kong and adhere to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United States urges China to respect the autonomy of Hong Kong's government, civil service, judiciary, police, and anti-corruption commission. The United States calls on China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Presidential determination under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and additional reporting requirements are emphasized. The President will consider Hong Kong's autonomy and the actions of China in determining its treatment under US laws. The Secretary of State must assess if Hong Kong has a freely elected legislature in reports to Congress. The Secretary will evaluate Hong Kong's electoral system and the conclusion of agreements with the US, including investment, extradition, and consular access treaties. The Secretary will assess the cooperation of Hong Kong government agencies with the US in areas such as customs enforcement, drug interdiction, and money laundering prevention. Additionally, the Secretary will evaluate Hong Kong's autonomy, lack of corruption, and respect for the rule of law. The Secretary will assess the respect for the rule of law in Hong Kong, including efforts to suppress freedom of the press and interfere with autonomy. Additionally, an evaluation will be made on the autonomy of the customs territory of Hong Kong, specifically looking at any failures to respect United States textile laws. The assessment will include the failure to respect United States textile laws and quotas, enforcement of export control laws, unauthorized diversions of high technology exports from the US to Hong Kong, diversion of Chinese exports through Hong Kong for preferential treatment in US markets, and misuse of Hong Kong's customs territory for China's foreign policy or trade goals. SEC. 6 prohibits the use of funds from the United States Information Agency for any member of the Hong Kong provisional legislature to participate in its programs. The term \"Hong Kong provisional legislature\" refers to the body appointed in 1996 to replace the elected Hong Kong Legislative Council. SEC. 7 defines \"Joint Declaration\" as the agreement between the UK and China on Hong Kong in 1984."
