    "content": "Agricultural conservation became a significant policy focus in the Food Security Act of 1985 and has been a recurring issue in subsequent farm bills. The 2008 farm bill continued to address concerns about funding, policy objectives, program effectiveness, and federal assistance structure. Conservation programs are well represented by small and mid-size farming operations and enjoy wider public support, but face competition for resources in a budget-constrained environment. The 2008 farm bill addressed funding priorities, payment structure, geographic targeting, program complexity, and the importance of large-scale conservation efforts. Key questions included whether payment limits should be program-specific, how funding levels would impact program participation, and the allocation of savings. Agricultural conservation and environmental issues are not evenly distributed due to the concentration of agricultural production in specific regions of the United States. Some areas and natural resources show greater environmental impact from agricultural activities. Pressures on farmland development are more pronounced on the East and West Coasts. Water and air quality issues vary in severity across different regions. Questions arise on where federal conservation spending should be targeted and if certain producer groups or types of agricultural production should receive higher priority. Concerns are raised about the complexity of adhering to regulations governing conservation programs. The effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural conservation programs are being questioned, with concerns about duplication and complexity. There is a need to evaluate if existing programs can be combined to target specific resource issues and improve delivery capacity. Additionally, the potential impact of staff retirements on program administration and the possibility of implementing more market-based solutions for resource conservation are being considered. Local planning and implementation of conservation programs through locally constituted councils is crucial for conservation management in the U.S. However, there are questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs at larger scales, such as regional or multistate levels. Concerns about declining participation if programs are more remote from local input exist. Using watersheds or river basins as policy targets could enhance efficiency by pooling resources and targeting common resource issues. Examples include the Chesapeake Bay region, the Great Lakes, and specific river basins with significant agricultural impacts. Federal conservation programs are being evaluated for their effectiveness in managing natural resources, particularly in areas like lakes and river basins with agricultural impacts. Developing reliable indicators for measuring conservation success across different programs and locations remains a challenge. Despite general agreement on the positive impact of conservation measures, questions about cost, location-specific effectiveness, and specific circumstances persist. The importance of valid indicators in environmental management is recognized, with research advancements making integration of findings into current programs more feasible. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes and modifies existing conservation programs while introducing new ones. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes and modifies existing conservation programs, creating new ones like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) to convert land back into forests, grasslands, or wetlands. Working lands programs provide assistance to improve natural resource conservation on productive lands. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary program administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) that aims to conserve soil, water, and wildlife resources by converting environmentally sensitive acreage to long-term vegetative cover. It provides annual rental payments and financial assistance for conservation practices. CRP is the largest conservation program in terms of funding and has subprograms like the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) to support state and federal partnerships. The 2008 farm bill caps CRP enrollment at 32 million acres. The 2008 farm bill capped CRP enrollment at 32 million acres, but the new bill reduces it to 39.2 million acres. The bill includes program changes such as addressing state, regional, and national conservation initiatives, providing incentives for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers to purchase CRP land, allowing managed haying and grazing on enrolled lands, requiring participants to manage lands according to a conservation plan, and establishing cost-sharing rates for conservation structures. Each state can enroll up to 100,000 acres in the pilot program for wetland and buffer acres in CRP. The farm bill allows up to 200,000 acres in each state for the CRP program, with eligible lands including wetlands, constructed wetlands for managing fertilizer runoff, and land for commercial pond-raised aquaculture. Managed haying and grazing on CRP acreage is permitted for drought response and invasive species control. State technical committees must coordinate for environmental management. Wind turbine installation on enrolled land is now allowed, with rental payment reductions for authorized activities. Cost-share payments are permitted for hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors on CRP land. The 2008 farm bill authorizes $100 million for cost sharing to improve natural resource management on CRP land. It modifies evaluation criteria for CRP contract applications, giving preference to residents of the county or contiguous county. Incentives are provided for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, with $25 million authorized for land transfer assistance. The 2008 farm bill authorizes $25 million for land transfer assistance in CRP, expands funding priority to rivers draining into the Chesapeake Bay, and allows retired or disabled farmers to exclude CRP payments from self-employment taxes. The bill also increases the WRP maximum enrollment cap to over 3.014 million acres and expands eligible lands to include private and tribal wetlands, croplands, and grasslands. The 2008 farm bill authorizes a new Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program to include private and tribal wetlands, croplands, and grasslands. It also makes program changes, such as adjusting payment schedules and specifying criteria for ranking applications. The Grassland Reserve Program helps landowners restore and protect grassland, rangeland, pastureland, and shrubland. The bill sets a new acreage enrollment goal and allocates funds for rental contracts and permanent conservation easements. The 2012 farm bill authorizes the Grassland Reserve Program with funds for rental contracts and permanent easements. Cooperative agreements similar to the Farmland Protection Program are allowed for GRP easements. The bill allows for fire presuppression and grazing-related activities on GRP contracts and easements. Priority is given to certain expiring CRP lands and tribal lands are eligible. The bill does not include a Grassland Reserve Enhancement provision. The Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FFP) is a voluntary program that provides matching funds to purchase development rights for farmlands to keep them in agricultural use. The 2008 farm bill changed the FFP's purpose to protect the land's agricultural use. The 2012 farm bill restructures the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FFP) to emphasize longer term cooperative agreements and makes technical changes to the program. The bill provides additional budget authority for FFP of $743 million and includes major working lands programs like EQIP, CSP, AMA, and WHIP. EQIP and CSP received additional budget authority under the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill allocated $3.4 billion for EQIP and $1.1 billion for CSP. The bill expanded EQIP to cover practices that enhance soil, water, air quality, and energy conservation on various types of land. It prioritizes cost-effectiveness and comprehensive treatment of resource issues, with 5% of spending set aside for beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers. The 2008 farm bill allocated $3.4 billion for EQIP, with 5% reserved for beginning farmers and ranchers, and 5% for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. It provides up to 90% of the costs for implementing EQIP plans for these farmers, along with payments for tribal members, producers transitioning to organic production, and projects with special environmental significance. The bill lowers the EQIP payment limit to $300,000 in any 6-year period, with organic production benefits capped at $20,000 annually. Additionally, 60% of funds are designated for cost-sharing with livestock producers, and $37.5 million is reserved for the Conservation Innovation Grants program to cover air quality concerns associated with agriculture. The bill also introduces the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) to address water conservation. The Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is part of EQIP to address water quality and quantity concerns on agricultural land, with priority areas including the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer region, Puget Sound, the Ogallala Aquifer, and others. AWEP prioritizes assistance to areas experiencing significant drought and receives $280 million through FY2012. The Conservation Security Program, a voluntary program promoting conservation on tribal and private working lands, is phased out under the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill phases out the Conservation Security Program and replaces it with the new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). The new CSP, starting in 2009, encourages conservation practices on working lands but with changes like 5-year contracts and direct payment attribution. Funding of over $2 billion is available for existing CSP contracts. Payments for new CSP contracts are based on meeting a stewardship threshold for resource conservation and environmental management. The new Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) under the 2008 farm bill reserves funds for beginning and disadvantaged farmers, sets a target of enrolling 12.8 million acres annually, limits individual payments to $200,000 in a 5-year period, expands eligible lands to include priority resource concerns, provides technical assistance to specialty crop and organic producers, and offers supplemental payments for resource-conserving crop rotations. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) provides cost-share assistance for establishing and improving fish and wildlife habitat on private land. The program focuses on developing wildlife habitat on private agricultural land, nonindustrial private forest land, and tribal lands. WHIP agreements typically last 5 to 10 years and prioritize projects addressing state, regional, and national wildlife issues. The USDA prioritizes projects addressing conservation initiatives at state, regional, and national levels. The 2008 farm bill allocates funding for wildlife initiatives, increases cost-share payments to 25%, and limits payments to $50,000 per year. Additional funding is provided for the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The Grassroots Source Water Protection Program aims to prevent water pollution, while the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program focuses on rehabilitating community dams. The 2008 farm bill provides additional funding for conservation programs such as the Agricultural Management Assistance Program (AMA) and the Resource Conservation and Development Program (RC&D). It also reauthorizes the Farm Viability Program and includes Hawaii as an eligible state. The bill emphasizes locally led planning processes and provides assistance for implementing area plans. The Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control is also reauthorized through FY2012. The Great Lakes Basin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control is a federal-state partnership providing technical assistance projects in the Great Lakes region. The program is coordinated by the Great Lakes Commission in partnership with NRCS, EPA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The 2008 farm bill modifies the program to implement recommendations from the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, providing site-specific technical assistance for producers in conservation strategies. Special provisions ensure that specialty crops, organic producers, and precision agricultural producers receive adequate conservation TA. The enacted bill authorizes a national certification process for third-party providers and creates an Agriculture Conservation Experienced Services (ACES) Program for older, non-USDA employees. It also establishes state TA committees and a Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI) to target conservation priorities on agricultural and nonindustrial private forest land. Eligible CCPI programs include EQIP, CSP, WHIP, and others, with 6% of funding reserved for CCPI initiatives. The 2008 farm bill reserves 6% of funding for CCPI initiatives and sets criteria for project prioritization, including innovative conservation methods. It also mandates various reports on conservation programs, such as enrollment and payments over $250,000, and introduces new programs like the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program. Additionally, it expands USDA conservation activities, including in the Chesapeake region. The 2008 farm bill introduces new programs, such as expanding conservation activities in the Chesapeake Bay region, state grants program, limiting production on native sod, and promoting market-based conservation approaches. The program aims to conserve the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with priority given to specific rivers. It authorizes significant funding over several years for conservation efforts. Additionally, the bill includes a provision for state grants to encourage public access for wildlife-dependent recreation. The 2020 farm bill introduces a provision that makes producers planting an insurable crop on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and the NAP program for the first five years. This provision may apply to virgin prairie converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area. The bill aims to facilitate participation in environmental services markets like water and air quality, habitat protection, and carbon storage. Additionally, the bill includes changes to programs like the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act, which provides funding for resource management activities targeting sources of salinity in the Colorado River. The 2008 farm bill establishes a loan program to assist producers with financing conservation installations. Priority is given to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, those converting to organic systems, and producers needing conservation assistance for compliance requirements. The bill also provides funding for desert terminal lakes and land/water purchases in the Walker River Basin. The 2008 farm bill has received positive feedback from agriculture and farmland conservation groups for its expanded provisions and increased funding in the Conservation Title. However, some national wildlife groups have expressed concerns about changes made during conference negotiations, including reductions in CRP acreage enrollment cap, easing of requirements under the \"sodsaver\" provision, limitations on eligible lands under the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, and the establishment of a new permanent disaster fund that could encourage planting on marginal lands."
