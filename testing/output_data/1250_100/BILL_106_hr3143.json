    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy environment, over half of schools are over 40 years old and need renovation, inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can affect student performance, and inefficient water use is prevalent in older schools. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation leads to high performance buildings, improved student and teacher performance, lower life-cycle costs, and significant energy savings. Utilizing renewable energy sources in low-energy buildings further enhances energy efficiency. The purpose of this Act is to assist school districts in creating high performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly elementary and secondary school buildings. Congress is considering legislation to help schools build new facilities and renovate existing ones. Many school districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for optimal efficiency in construction and renovations. The Act aims to help school districts create energy-efficient and environmentally friendly school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements of at least 30 percent beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Grants are given to districts with increasing enrollments or needing renovations for school facilities. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts with enrollment growth or facility renovation needs. Districts must show inadequate funds to respond to enrollments or make investments without assistance. Grant funds must be used to develop high performance school buildings according to an approved plan. Grants can also be used for evaluating compliance, distributing information, organizing programs, and obtaining technical services. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts for planning and designing high performance school buildings, collecting data, and promoting participation in energy-efficient projects. Grants are provided to districts with approved feasible plans developed in consultation with state energy and education offices. The State agency encourages school districts to supplement grant funds with other sources for implementing their plans. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.\n\nGovernors will receive funds for this Act, with each Governor deciding the State agency to manage the assistance program for school districts. Funds will be allocated as follows: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in implementing the Program. \n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$200,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2001, $210,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $220,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and necessary sums for subsequent 6 years.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines terms like \"elementary school,\" \"secondary school,\" \"high performance school building,\" and \"renewable energy.\""
