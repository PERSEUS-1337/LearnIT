The Act outlines individualized transition plans and transition planning services administrative units. Congress finds that evidence-based research has shown that youth with significant disabilities benefit from inclusive education, work experience, and paid work while in school. Higher rates of self-determination and flexible blending of government funds lead to better outcomes for individuals with disabilities during the transition into adulthood. Additional training for agency officials involved in providing supports and services is necessary for successful transitions. The Act aims to create a holistic system for the successful transition of youth with significant disabilities into adulthood. It focuses on achieving high expectations, promoting inclusion, and coordinating specific services for effective transitions.

This includes activities like youth development, leadership training, self-advocacy, and family involvement. The goal is to achieve outcomes like post-secondary education, integrated employment, asset development, independent living, and community participation. The Secretary will provide state assistance through grants to States for carrying out required activities under this subtitle. Payments will be allocated based on a formula considering the number of individuals to be served. Individualized transition plans are also addressed. Each State receiving assistance must develop an individual transition plan for individuals with developmental disabilities transitioning into adulthood. The plan aims to coordinate services for integrated employment, postsecondary education, independent living, and community engagement. The plan must be formulated within 30 days of exiting secondary school, applicable until age 26, and reviewed annually. An Individual Transition Plan (ITP) for individuals with developmental disabilities transitioning into adulthood must be developed by each State. The plan includes strategies for integrated employment, postsecondary education, independent living, and community engagement. It must be formulated within 30 days of exiting secondary school, applicable until age 26, and reviewed annually. The plan is developed during in-person meetings led by the State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency, involving various stakeholders such as the individual, family, transition broker, vocational rehabilitation agency, service providers, transition coordinator, assistive technology experts, and representatives of the workforce development sector. An ITP must include effective service models addressing postsecondary education, career preparation, leadership, family involvement, and economic self-sufficiency goals through tools like tax benefits and education financing. \"Transition planning and services administrative unit established under SEC. 174.\" Each State receiving assistance under this subtitle must establish a transition planning and services (TPS) administrative unit within the State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency. The primary focus of the TPS unit is to help individuals with developmental disabilities transition from the secondary school system to adulthood by developing and implementing individual transition plans (ITPs) and employing transition brokers to coordinate among State agencies. The TPS administrative unit assists individuals with developmental disabilities in navigating support services and programs. Transition brokers must have qualifications in disabilities, benefits planning, employment services, and workforce development. Transition brokers in the TPS administrative unit must have expertise in asset development, tax benefits, work incentives, savings plans, education financing, budget management, self-direction, and person-centered planning. They are assigned to individuals based on selection by the individual or their family, approved by the State agency. Additionally, individuals are supported in developing self-advocacy, self-determination skills, and peer relationships. The TPS administrative unit provides strategies and training for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families on self-advocacy, self-determination skills, and peer mentoring. They also offer information on Federal and State services, supports, and regulations, including asset development and eligibility criteria. The State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency facilitates multiagency collaboration. Assistance under this subtitle aims to coordinate and improve services for individuals with developmental disabilities during the transition into adulthood by facilitating memoranda of understanding among key State agencies. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of the subtitle, including the number of individuals with Individual Transition Plans (ITPs) developed, progress in ITP objectives, and demographic information of individuals with ITPs. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out this subtitle."
