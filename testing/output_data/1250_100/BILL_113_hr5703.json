Congress finds that protecting international cultural property is crucial for US cultural diplomacy, as it reflects respect for other cultures and the common heritage of humanity. Instances of cultural property loss, damage, and destruction have occurred due to various factors like political instability, armed conflict, and natural disasters. Notable examples include the ransacking of museums in Egypt, looting of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, and damage to medieval cities in Syria during the civil war. These events have resulted in the destruction and loss of significant ancient artifacts, leaving gaps in humanity's historical record. The destruction of cultural sites and artifacts by militant groups like ISIS/ISIL in Iraq, Syria, Mali, and Afghanistan has caused significant loss and damage to UNESCO World Heritage Sites, museums, and archaeological sites. This includes the looting of ancient artifacts and the destruction of historic landmarks, such as the Tomb of Jonah and the Bamiyan Buddhas. In Afghanistan, the Buddhas carved into a cliff side were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001, leading to global condemnation. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge destroyed Buddhist temples, statues, mosques, and Catholic churches after seizing power in 1975. In China, the Cultural Revolution resulted in the destruction of many antiques and parts of old Beijing, with efforts now underway to rebuild lost architectural heritage. In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed art, artifacts, and archives, as well as partially damaging the 17th century city of Jacmel. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami caused massive loss of life in eleven countries.

The destruction of these sites represents an irreparable loss of humanity's common cultural heritage. The United States Armed Forces have played important roles in preserving and protecting cultural property through the establishment of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas. The Monuments Men, part of the MFAA, recovered art stolen by Nazis in WWII. The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield supports the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. The U.S. policy is to preserve international cultural property at risk. The U.S. is committed to upholding international laws to protect cultural property during armed conflicts, preventing the importation of stolen cultural property, and enforcing existing laws to prevent trafficking in stolen or looted cultural property. The White House Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection is established under Section 4. The White House Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection appointed by the President will coordinate and promote efforts involving multiple Federal agencies, submit annual reports to congressional committees, provide policy recommendations, resolve interagency differences, and collaborate with domestic and international actors. The White House Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection will work with museums, educational institutions, research institutions, and the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield to promote and protect international cultural property. SEC. 5. INFORMATION ON ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY.

The Department of Justice has used statutes and regulations in criminal, civil, and civil forfeiture actions to prevent trafficking in stolen cultural property and investigate transnational organized crime. They have also taken actions to ensure consistent and effective application of law in cases involving international cultural property. Federal agencies can partner with the Smithsonian Institution for international cultural property protection activities, allowing personnel from the Smithsonian to assist in such efforts. Agencies are authorized to cover the salaries and expenses of Smithsonian personnel for this purpose, including support for military, diplomatic, and law enforcement missions. The Secretary of State is authorized to make grants for international cultural property protection activities in areas at risk of destruction. Additionally, emergency protection for Syrian cultural property is addressed. The President will apply import restrictions to archaeological or ethnological material of Syria as if Syria were a State Party to the Convention on the Cultural Property Implementation Act. The restrictions will take effect within 60 days of the enactment of this Act, defining the material as cultural property unlawfully removed from Syria after August 18, 2011.
