However, the entire wage gap cannot be explained by these factors. Using median weekly wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the debate on the male-female pay gap is illustrated. Female workers are often in lower-earning occupations, contributing to the earnings gap. Women are overrepresented in lower-earning occupations like personal care and service, while men dominate higher-earning fields like construction. Full-time male workers work more hours than females, with a smaller pay gap for those working exactly 40 hours per week. The earnings gap is smaller for younger workers and unmarried individuals without children. Some argue that the pay gap is negligible and does not require further policy interventions. The pay gap between male and female workers may be the result of discrimination, with no widely accepted methodology able to attribute the entirety of the gap to factors other than the worker's sex. Two federal laws, the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, provide remedies for sex-based wage discrimination. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) prohibits sex-based wage discrimination by employers, allowing for wage differentials based on factors other than sex. The standard for \"equal work\" focuses on job similarity in terms of skill, effort, and responsibility. The EPA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provide remedies for sex-based wage discrimination, with differences in substantive, procedural, and remedial aspects. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) prohibits sex-based wage discrimination by employers, focusing on job similarity in terms of skill, effort, and responsibility. A crucial difference is that the EPA does not limit an employer's liability for intentional wage discrimination under Title VII. Violation of the EPA generally violates Title VII, but the converse is not true. Remedies for violation of the two laws differ, with the EPA allowing for backpay and liquidated damages, while Title VII authorizes compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination. The Title VII damages remedy is limited by dollar caps, which vary depending on the size of the employer. In 2007, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., where the plaintiff alleged past sex discrimination resulting in lower pay increases, leading to a significant pay disparity with male colleagues. Plaintiffs under Title VII must file suit within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice, with the Court rejecting the argument that each paycheck constituted a new violation of the statute. The Supreme Court decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear limited some pay discrimination claims under Title VII due to filing deadlines. However, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 clarified that the time limit for suing employers for pay discrimination begins with each paycheck issued. This change applies to Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a class action was permitted on behalf of over 1.5 million female employees for alleged discrimination. In Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., female employees alleged pay disparities and lack of promotions compared to male counterparts. Studies showed a significant gender gap in management positions, with women earning less than men. The court assessed if evidence supported a class action for discrimination claims. The court noted significant gender pay disparities at Wal-Mart, rejecting the argument that decentralized decision-making caused the disparities. Title VII does not exempt large employers from discrimination claims, and the court found the possibility of discrimination in compensation and promotion policies affecting all plaintiffs. The court approved class certification for plaintiffs in a gender discrimination case against Wal-Mart. Despite multiple appellate court rulings upholding the certification, the Supreme Court reversed it in a 5-4 decision. The Court found that the plaintiffs failed to establish a common policy of discrimination at Wal-Mart, leading to the reversal. The Supreme Court reversed the class certification for plaintiffs in a gender discrimination case against Wal-Mart, stating that there was no common policy of discrimination. This decision may make it harder for plaintiffs to receive class certification in employment discrimination cases in the future. Plaintiffs can still pursue their claims individually or as part of a smaller class. Some plaintiffs filed new class action lawsuits against Wal-Mart in specific regions like California, Texas, Tennessee, and Florida, but these lawsuits have not been very successful. For example, a California court denied certification for a class of 150,000 women employees. In Florida, class certification requests were dismissed as time-barred, while suits in Tennessee and Texas were allowed to proceed. The statute of limitations does not prevent new claims from being filed against Wal-Mart in the future. The female plaintiffs in class action lawsuits against Wal-Mart must prove intentional discrimination in pay and promotions. Challenges include subjective personnel procedures and lack of documentation for promotion opportunities before January 2003. Successful claims could lead to substantial monetary damages under Title VII. Other corporations, like Morgan Stanley, settled similar pay discrimination cases for millions of dollars. Morgan Stanley settled a pay discrimination case for $40 million, with additional funds for victims and internal programs. Boeing and Citigroup also settled similar lawsuits, while Costco chose to defend itself in court. Costco's case was granted class-action status but was later remanded for reconsideration. The Costco pay discrimination case was granted class-action status and eventually settled for $8 million. Despite the stricter post-Dukes standards, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, citing specific management positions and controlled promotion processes as key factors. The Ledbetter legislation is the only new pay discrimination law enacted by Congress recently, highlighting ongoing congressional attention to pay equity issues. In recent years, pay equity has been a focus in Congress with bills like the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay Act introduced in the 114th Congress. Other bills include the End Pay Discrimination Through Information Act, Workplace Advancement Act, and Gender Advancement in Pay Act. The Paycheck Fairness Act aims to increase penalties for wage discrimination based on gender and provide training and recognition programs for employers. The Paycheck Fairness Act would reform procedures and remedies for enforcing equal work standards under the EPA. It would authorize EPA class actions, compensatory and punitive damages, and establish more restrictive standards for proof by employers of an affirmative defense to EPA liability. The proposed pay equity bills aim to enhance EPA enforcement through record-keeping, data collection, and recognition of employers promoting pay equity. The Fair Pay Act expands the scope of the EPA to include racial and ethnic minorities as protected classes. The Fair Pay Act would provide greater protection to minority groups than Title VII by requiring equal wages regardless of sex, race, or national origin for workers in equivalent jobs. It would narrow the EPA's catchall exception and introduce compensatory and punitive damages without a statutory limit. Wage disparities between dissimilar jobs could be permitted if they are deemed equivalent in some manner. The Fair Pay Act would require employers to maintain wage records and submit annual reports to the EEOC on workforce demographics. It aims to prevent discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender in equivalent job roles. New bills like the End Pay Discrimination Through Information Act and Workplace Advancement Act also address pay discrimination issues. The Gender Advancement in Pay Act (GAP Act; S. 2773) expands the EPA's antiretaliation provisions to protect employees sharing salary information. It also modifies employer defenses under the EPA, exempting wage differentials based on expertise or business-related factors other than sex. The bill includes tolling the statute of limitations, adding civil penalties for willful violations, and creating a grant program to increase women's participation in high-demand industries. The Gender Advancement in Pay Act aims to increase women's participation in underrepresented industries. It also mandates the development of technical assistance materials for small businesses to comply with the law."
