    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a high mortality rate and low survival rate compared to other types of cancer. The incidence of lung cancer is projected to increase significantly, especially among minority communities. Lung cancer research funding is significantly lower compared to other major cancers, despite its high mortality rate. Radon and environmental contaminants are also identified as leading causes of lung cancer, along with smoking. Hormonal and genetic factors may also play a role in the onset of the disease. Lung cancer is highly stigmatized and often blamed on patients, even those who never smoked. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers, with a majority being former smokers. It is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in non-smokers, with a higher impact on women. Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens are at increased risk for lung cancer. Emissions increase lung cancer risk. Only 16% of lung cancer diagnosed early. Actuarial analysis shows early detection could save 70,000 lives/year. National Cancer Institute study predicts $433 billion lost to lung cancer by 2020. National Lung Screening Trial compares CT scan effectiveness. A study compared low-dose helical CT scans and chest x-rays for lung cancer mortality, showing a 20% decrease in lung cancer deaths with CT scans. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program led by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to address all aspects of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers. This includes the addition of a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program to the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. This program involves strategic research grant prioritization by the National Cancer Institute. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020 through strategic research grant prioritization. This includes funding for research on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and innovative screening and treatment methods. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020 through strategic research grant prioritization. This includes funding for research programs on lung cancer incidence and collaboration on prevention, early detection, and disease management research for minority populations. Funds are also provided to enable the establishment of quality standards and guidelines for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 includes provisions for expedited revision of imaging standards, annual compliance surveys, funding for a Lung Cancer Early Detection Program, research on environmental contaminants linked to lung cancer, and the establishment of an early detection program. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates State plans to include lung cancer mortality reduction measures, annual review of early detection methods by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, coordination of programs for women and minorities, and collaboration of tobacco control programs to achieve program goals. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program focuses on coordinating drug and cessation treatments with early detection protocols. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will work with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program and implement a demonstration project for military personnel and veterans at risk for lung cancer. They will also coordinate care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project in collaboration with various agencies and organizations within a year of the Act's enactment. The Demonstration Project, overseen by the Secretary, aims to identify optimal risk populations for screening, develop effective screening processes, ensure quality controls, and integrate health information technology. The project will involve selected healthcare centers to carry out the screening program. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer. A 5-year demonstration project will be conducted, with regular reports to Congress on costs and progress. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board to monitor programs under the Act, composed of various government officials and representatives from different fields related to lung cancer. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is provided to carry out the Act and its amendments."
