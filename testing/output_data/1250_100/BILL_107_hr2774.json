The Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Act of 2001 establishes the Renewable Energy Source Facility Guaranteed Loan Program, which provides loan guarantees for qualified renewable energy source facilities. A Loan Guarantee Board is established to administer the Program, composed of key government officials. The Program may guarantee loans for qualified facilities provided by private institutions, ensuring small businesses receive assistance. The Loan Guarantee Board ensures small businesses receive appropriate loan guarantees under the Program, with a total limit of $750,000,000. The Board must act promptly on guarantee applications. Loan guarantees may be issued for renewable energy facilities if credit is not otherwise available under reasonable terms. The Loan Guarantee Board provides loan guarantees for small businesses, ensuring repayment by assessing the owner's earning power and security pledged. Loans must be repaid by December 31, 2025, with terms that cannot be amended without Board consent. Loan guarantees may be issued for renewable energy facilities if credit is not available under reasonable terms. The Loan Guarantee Board requires security for loans, fees are paid to cover costs, audits are conducted periodically, and reports are submitted to Congress annually until loans are fully repaid."
