    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use State infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more flexibility in developing low-cost support for public-private transportation partnerships. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created to finance transportation projects at the State or multi-State level. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to entities constructing eligible transportation projects. The banks can loan or provide assistance for the construction or capital costs of qualifying transportation projects. State infrastructure banks can offer loans or assistance for qualifying transportation projects. Loans or assistance received can be subordinated to other debt financing. To qualify as a State infrastructure bank, each State must maintain an investment grade rating on its debt or have sufficient insurance. Investment income generated by funds deposited into the bank must be ensured. The funds deposited into the bank will be credited, available for loans to transportation projects, and invested to earn interest. Repayment of loans can be credited back to the bank or used for the same purpose. Loans will bear appropriate interest and repayment must start within 5 years of the facility opening. The Secretary must ensure loan repayment within 30 years, limit bank transfers, and require annual reports. Federal disbursements must align with historic rates, and procedures for State infrastructure banks must be specified. States can contribute from Title 23 funds. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 allows States to transfer a limited amount of Federal funds to State infrastructure banks. The deposit of Federal apportionments into a State infrastructure bank does not create any obligation on the part of the United States. Management of Federal funds is governed by specific sections of title. The Act allows States to transfer Federal funds to State infrastructure banks for capital reserves. States can contribute up to 2% of Federal funds for bank administration costs."
