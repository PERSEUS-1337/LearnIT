    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for special education and related services, setting out principles for providing free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities. States must identify, evaluate, and provide individualized education programs (IEP) for eligible children, involving parents in the planning process. Children with disabilities should be educated alongside non-disabled peers whenever possible. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures that children with disabilities are educated alongside non-disabled peers. Procedural safeguards, including the right to a due process hearing and IEP meetings, are provided to children and their parents. The IEP is crucial in improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities by involving teachers, parents, and school administrators in planning individualized education programs. The IEP must include information on the child's current school performance, annual goals, special education services, participation in regular classrooms, testing modifications, service start dates and duration, post-school goals, transition services, rights at age of majority, progress measurement, and parental communication. Special considerations may include behavior management, language proficiency, communication needs, braille materials, and assistive technology. The Department of Education's sample IEP form is five pages long, with efforts to minimize paperwork burdens on states and local school districts. A study found that over half of special education teachers spend 5 hours per week on administrative paperwork, impacting their teaching duties significantly. Special education teachers spend significant time completing administrative paperwork, with activities like revising IEPs and conducting assessments. Legislation aims to reduce paperwork burdens, with provisions in bills focused on this goal. Both H.R. 1350 and S. 1248 bills aim to reduce paperwork burdens in special education by requiring the GAO to study and report on paperwork, changing eligibility provisions for states and local educational agencies, allowing the use of IDEA Part B grants for paperwork reduction activities, and eliminating certain requirements in current law such as school-based improvement plans and benchmarks in IEPs. Both H.R. 1350 and S. 1248 bills aim to reduce paperwork burdens in special education by allowing multi-year IEPs for older children, limiting the time period for complaints under IDEA, authorizing a pilot program for waiver of Act requirements in ten states, and requiring the Secretary of Education to create model IEPs for consistency across states."
