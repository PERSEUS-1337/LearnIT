The budget request was for $7.58 billion, with $6.99 billion in discretionary funds and $0.59 billion in mandatory funding for judges' salaries and benefits. The FY2017 judiciary budget request of $7.58 billion was included in the President's budget submission without changes. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Financial Services did not hold hearings on the request. The House subcommittee accepted programmatic and language submissions until March 17, 2016. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $7.55 billion in funds for the judiciary, including mandatory funds for judges' salaries and benefits. The bill was reported by a vote of 30-18 with no amendments related to the judiciary. The Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government recommended $7.58 billion in funds for the judiciary, including mandatory funds for judges' salaries and benefits. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended the same amount. The House agreed to a structured rule for consideration of the Financial Services and General Government bill, with one amendment related to the judiciary reducing funding by $1 million. This amendment was passed on July 7. H.R. 5485, as amended, was agreed to on July 7 with a vote of 239-185. No further action was taken on H.R. 5485 or S. 3067 before the start of FY2017. Judicial branch activities were funded through continuing appropriations resolutions until the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. Division E of this act provides $7.5 billion for the judiciary, an increase of $176.2 million from FY2016. The judiciary's funding for FY2014 saw an increase of $221.9 million (3.2%) from the previous year, but was $37.9 million (-0.5%) less than requested. A funding gap led to a partial government shutdown for 16 days until a CR (P.L. 113-46) was enacted on October 17, 2013. The judiciary's budget comprises approximately 0.2% of total budget authority, with two accounts funding the Supreme Court totaling approximately 1% of the total judiciary budget. The judiciary's budget includes funding for the lower federal courts and related judicial services. The largest account covers salaries and expenses for various judicial positions, with other large accounts for Defender Services and Court Security. The remaining budget is divided among various specialized courts and administrative offices within the federal judiciary. The federal judiciary's budget includes funding for lower federal courts and related judicial services. Specialized courts like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and U.S. Tax Court are funded separately. Non-appropriated funds, mainly from court filing fees, help offset expenses within the judiciary. These funds are considered \"unencumbered\" savings from the judiciary's financial plan. The judiciary's budget request and appropriations figures reflect net resources and do not include offsetting non-appropriated funds. They have \"encumbered\" funds for specific purposes, used when planned expenses are delayed. Cost-containment efforts focus on office space rental, personnel expenses, information technology, and operating costs. Judge Julia S. Gibbons emphasized the judiciary's ongoing cost-containment efforts in the FY2017 budget submission. The judiciary's cost-containment initiatives, started in 2004, have led to significant savings. Efforts include shared administrative services, reducing space footprint, and reevaluating cost-saving methodologies. Judge Gibbons reported a $1.5 billion cost reduction over 10 years. The goal of a 3% reduction in total space has seen 30% progress, resulting in $5.8 million in rent savings. The judiciary aims to achieve the full reduction by fiscal year 2018. Efforts to improve judicial security have been spurred by recent incidents, including homicides and shootings targeting judges and court personnel. The judiciary has been working with the U.S. Marshals Service to enhance security measures, such as intrusion detection systems and the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. The FY2017 appropriation continued a pilot program for the USMS to assume responsibility for perimeter security at selected courthouses. The US Marshals Service (USMS) assumed responsibility for perimeter security at selected courthouses in FY2009 due to concerns about inadequate security by the Federal Protective Service (FPS). The program, implemented in January 2009, covers seven courthouses in various locations. The Judicial Conference recommended creating 57 new federal judgeships in March 2017, but no action has been taken on the proposed bills. The Judicial Conference recommended creating 73 new judgeships in the 114th Congress, but no final action was taken before adjournment. Appellate judgeships have remained at 179 since 1990, despite a 40% increase in case filings. District judgeships increased by 5% to 677, with a 38% increase in case filings.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over certain lower court rulings on patents, trademarks, international trade, and federal claims cases. The FY2017 budget request for this court is $33.1 million, a decrease of 2.1% over FY2016.
