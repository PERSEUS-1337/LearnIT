    "content": "The Act titled \"Ensuring Access to General Surgery Act of 2017\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds a shortage of physicians, with projections showing a growing gap in the supply of general surgeons by 2030. Comprehensive research and data are needed to address future workforce demands influenced by various factors. Given the acute needs in rural and surgical workforce shortage areas, additional efforts to assess the current general surgeon workforce are necessary to address future workforce demands. SEC. 3. STUDY ON DESIGNATION OF GENERAL SURGERY SHORTAGE AREAS. Part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the designation of General Surgery Shortage Areas. The term 'general surgery shortage area' refers to areas underserved by general surgeons in urban, suburban, or rural areas. The Secretary will conduct a study on the adequacy of local general surgeons to address the needs of underserved populations. This includes assessing the accuracy of current shortage designations and exploring alternative measures of access to general surgeons. The Secretary will analyze potential methodologies for designating general surgery shortage areas, including the development of surgery service areas and the identification of actively practicing general surgeons. The Secretary will develop general surgeon-to-population ratios for different service areas and determine threshold ratios for optimal, adequate, shortage, and critical shortage levels. A report on the study will be submitted to Congress within a year, with consultation from relevant stakeholders. The Secretary will periodically publish data comparing availability of general surgery services in different areas and designate shortage areas through a regulatory methodology. The Secretary will use a regulatory methodology to designate general surgery shortage areas in the United States, publish a list of these areas, and review and revise the designations annually. Similar procedures for notice, comment, dissemination of information, and reporting to Congress will be followed as with health professional shortage areas. The Secretary will consult with relevant stakeholders, including medical societies, organizations representing surgical facilities, expertise in general surgery, and patient advocacy groups when designating general surgery shortage areas."
