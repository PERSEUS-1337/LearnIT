    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy based on their specific operating requirements and statutory mission. Each Federal agency must develop an implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies (ICT) to increase efficiency and utilization, including advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services, data center strategies, power management, building information modeling, and telework tools. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems. This includes specifications and benchmarks for data center operators to make informed decisions on energy efficiency and cost savings, with an overall Federal target for increased energy efficiency. The performance goals established for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems include measuring IT costs and cost savings over a 3 to 5 year period, as well as providing recommendations for achieving benchmarks, such as using energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting. The Federal Data Centers Task Force, comprised of program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers, collaborates to achieve agency and Federal energy efficiency goals. They exchange best practices with the private sector and provide a complete picture of costs and savings, including energy costs. Federal agencies must include descriptions of their efforts and results in reports under the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Director of OMB will also include this information in their annual report and scorecard starting from October 1, 2013. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization for coordinating energy-efficient government technology programs. The Secretary and Administrator are required to make this designation public. Additionally, a study on server and data center energy efficiency is mandated to be updated and made available to the public by December 31, 2013. The Secretary, in collaboration with the designated organization, will provide a comparison of estimates from 2007-2012, analyze the impact of information technologies, and update projections and recommendations. They will also maintain a data center energy practitioner program for certifying energy practitioners. The Federal agency shall evaluate data centers every 4 years using certified energy practitioners. A new open data initiative will make energy data accessible for innovation while protecting national security interests. The Secretary will consider using the online Data Center Maturity Model and collaborate on global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. Additionally, they will assist in developing an efficiency metric for the overall data center, including ICT systems and infrastructure."
