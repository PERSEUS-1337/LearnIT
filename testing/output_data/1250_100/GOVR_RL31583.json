    "content": "The federal K-12 education assistance legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, has focused on providing flexibility for grantees. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, including waivers for federal program requirements based on certain eligibility criteria and accountability requirements. The federal K-12 education assistance legislation allows for flexibility in program outcomes, including consolidation of programs and fund transfers. This flexibility applies to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) but not the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The report focuses on ESEA programs and potential amendments in the 110th Congress. The report discusses the general nature of federal K-12 education program requirements, including special flexibility authorities to waive or modify these requirements. It analyzes issues specific to these authorities and concludes with cross-cutting issues related to flexibility. Federal K-12 education programs have specific requirements to ensure accountability in the use of federal funds. These programs focus on student populations with special needs, instructional services, innovative approaches, and specific subject areas. The flexibility in these programs allows for variations in instructional methods and grade levels. Most federal K-12 education programs have specific requirements to ensure accountability in the use of funds. These programs are categorized into (a)-(d) with a distinction between \"categorical\" programs and the Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A, which is considered a \"block grant.\" Federal requirements and guidance are provided to state and local recipients, with a focus on meeting legal obligations through regulations and statutory text. The Federal Register publishes regulations that are later integrated into the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations supplement statutory language on complex issues prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education. Non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided through extensive Q&A or \"Dear Colleague\" letters, which grantees are not legally required to follow. Grantees often view \"non-regulatory\" guidance as equivalent to regulations, even though they are not legally required to follow it. This guidance, like competitive priorities set by the Department of Education, may influence how federal aid is used, even though compliance is not mandatory. The Department of Education sets competitive priorities for grant applicants, which are not mandatory but increase the chances of receiving support. These priorities are typically outlined in the grant competition announcement in the Federal Register. In recent years, there has been a shift towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all. Guidance in the statute is often deemed sufficient without additional regulations, and for programs with regulations, they are generally brief and address fewer issues than before. The Department of Education has adopted a similar approach to addressing program issues, focusing on standards, assessments, and accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. Following the NCLB of 2001, the Department aims to regulate only when necessary, providing nonregulatory guidance to inform stakeholders about flexibility in carrying out Title I programs. Federal K-12 education assistance requirements cover a wide range of activities, services, and outcomes for SEAs, LEAs, and others. Federal elementary and secondary education program requirements focus on target, outcome, and fiscal accountability to ensure appropriate use of federal aid funds for promoting equal educational opportunities, improving student achievement, and maintaining financial integrity. Federal elementary and secondary education program requirements aim to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately for specific purposes, such as targeting high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, enhancing parental participation, and evaluating instructional services. Grantees must comply with these requirements to avoid potential sanctions, including repayment of funds or being ineligible for further grants. Federal elementary and secondary education program requirements include specific sanctions for states or LEAs that fail to meet requirements, along with general requirements applicable to all recipients of federal education assistance. These requirements cover areas such as financial management, civil rights, privacy of student records, and compliance with federal child nutrition programs. Additionally, federal regulations from agencies other than the Department of Education may also apply to LEAs and schools. State and local educational agencies have wide discretion in many aspects of federal education assistance, such as grade levels and instructional techniques. Complaints about specific requirements often focus on prohibitions against mixing funds or restrictions on resource use. The curr_chunk discusses various requirements and restrictions related to federal education assistance programs, including prohibitions against commingling funds, targeting aid on pupils with the greatest needs, eligibility thresholds for flexibility programs, and outcome accountability requirements under the NCLB. These measures aim to ensure fiscal accountability, focus limited funds on those in need, and improve the effectiveness of education services. The traditional federal categorical approach in education programs may lead to fragmented instruction and inefficient resource allocation, especially in low-enrollment LEAs. This approach focuses on targeting resources at high-need pupil groups, but it may result in challenges with coordinating special program instruction, inefficient resource use, and fragmented services to children. There are concerns about treating partial needs instead of focusing on the whole child's instructional program and potentially instructing pupils in separate settings when it may not be the most effective approach. The traditional federal categorical approach in education programs may lead to fragmented instruction and inefficient resource allocation, especially in low-enrollment LEAs. Difficulties may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying policies and demographic conditions. State and local education officials sometimes complain about constraints on the use of federal funds. LEA staff expressed concerns about difficulties in obtaining current, accurate information on federal requirements, high costs of meeting administrative responsibilities, and challenges with meeting timelines in federal K-12 education programs. They often lack awareness of available flexibility and face logistical and management challenges. Several authorities allow waivers of federal K-12 program requirements by SEAs and LEAs, with limitations on the types of requirements that can be waived, affected programs, and eligibility. Different waiver authorities exist, including Ed-Flex, Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These flexibility options were established before the NCLB of 2001. The Ed-Flex authority, established before the NCLB of 2001, allows SEAs to waive certain requirements for LEAs or schools in participating states. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, it was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and later modified to remove the cap on participating states in 1999. Technical amendments were made in 2001, and the authority was extended in 2006 until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. Ed-Flex authority was granted to 12 states and Ed-Flex status under P.L. 106-25 was obtained by 10 states. No state has received Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. The authority for ED to grant Ed-Flex authority to additional states expired in FY2004. Recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) allowed the 10 existing Ed-Flex states to retain their authority until reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. States participating in Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards, and assessments. States participating in Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards, and assessments linked to ESEA Title I-A. The federal programs to which Ed-Flex applies include various ESEA Titles and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. These programs are administered by SEAs and allocate funds by formula. The Ed-Flex statutes allow participating states to waive certain administrative requirements of the General Education Provisions Act and Education Department General Administrative Regulations for specific programs. However, some requirements related to fiscal accountability, equitable participation, parental involvement, allocation of funds, school selection, and civil rights cannot be waived unless approved by the Secretary of Education. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply for waivers through their SEA, except for statewide \"blanket\" waivers. Waivers in Ed-Flex states must be applied for through the SEA, with similar requirements as those requesting waivers directly from ED. SEAs cannot waive their own requirements and must ensure that the purposes of the statutory requirements are still being met. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers, including information on their effects on student performance. ED is required to make these state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The 2001 report on Ed-Flex waivers lacked information on state use and impacts, focusing only on new authority in P.L. 106-25. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. Waivers can be granted to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Secretary of Education, primarily under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. Requests must be made by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. Waiver requests under ESEA Title IX-D must include specific, measurable educational goals and methods for measuring progress annually. Certain requirements, such as prohibitions on using funds for religious worship or sex education, cannot be waived. Additionally, eligibility requirements for charter schools under the Public Charter Schools program cannot be waived. The Secretary can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D for up to four years, with the possibility of extension if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if pupil performance is inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish waiver decisions in the Federal Register. A total of 197 waivers were granted between 2002 and 2006, with few being substantive. Between 2002 and 2006, a total of 197 waivers were granted under ESEA Title IX-D, with most being waivers of administrative cost limitations or extensions of fund obligation periods. Other waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, and accountability provisions. Annual reports on waiver effects and effectiveness are required by the Secretary under ESEA Title IX-D. The ESEA Title IX-D requires annual reports on waivers granted to schools. The PCS waiver authority allows for flexibility in waiving requirements, but it has been used infrequently. Schools eligible for schoolwide programs have flexibility in using federal funds from various education programs to improve services for all students, rather than targeting specific disadvantaged students. These programs are exempt from certain regulations as long as they meet the intent and purposes of the federal programs. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other sources, and IDEA requirements must still be met. The schoolwide program authority allows schools to use federal funds flexibly, primarily benefiting Title I-A programs. This flexibility is significant compared to traditional targeted assistance programs, as funds can be combined without separate accounting. Schoolwide programs have few additional requirements and have grown rapidly in recent years. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs under Title I-A has been reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB. This change allows more high poverty schools to qualify for schoolwide programs, as all pupils are considered disadvantaged and in need of special assistance. The rationale is to ensure that Title I-A grants can have a meaningful impact on overall school services in high poverty schools. The NCLB has reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to the national average percentage of pupils from low-income families, raising questions about its validity for schools meeting the new threshold. There is limited evidence on the achievement effects of this program expansion. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) provides flexibility for small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. LEAs with fewer than 600 pupils or located in low-density rural areas can combine funds received under ESEA Titles II-A. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to combine or transfer funds received under various ESEA programs to support activities authorized under different programs. This flexibility is necessary for the smallest LEAs due to the limited size of grants they receive, which may not be sufficient to support effective programs. This \"REAP Flex\" authority provides similar flexibility to eligible small, rural LEAs as another Transferability authority available to most LEAs under NCLB. The small, rural LEA authority under the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows for the transfer of funds from various ESEA programs, including Titles III and IV-B, with the advantage of supplementary grants. Participation in REAP Flex is widespread, with approximately 51% of eligible LEAs taking advantage of this flexibility in 2005-2006. Funds are often transferred from Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A for different educational purposes. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds from various ESEA programs, including Titles III and IV-B, with supplementary grants. Approximately 51% of eligible LEAs utilized this flexibility in 2005-2006, transferring funds from Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A for school improvement activities. There was confusion between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority at the LEA level, with some not clear on which authority they were using. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is considered a block grant providing flexibility to states and LEAs in using federal aid funds for a wide range of educational activities. ESEA Title V-A funds provide flexibility to states and LEAs, consolidating categorical programs to support various educational activities. Funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17, with a majority going to LEAs using state-developed formulas that consider enrollment, high-cost pupils, and disadvantaged families. The ESEA Title V-A funds provide flexibility to states and LEAs by consolidating categorical programs to support educational activities. States must suballocate a minimum percentage of funds to LEAs, with specific requirements based on funding levels. States can retain up to 15% of funds for administrative costs, with the remainder used for specified programs and services such as pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, and school repair. Title V-A funds under ESEA provide flexibility to states and LEAs for various educational activities, including school repair, renovation, and statewide education reform programs. LEAs can use funds for innovative assistance programs, such as charter schools, same-gender classrooms, and hiring school nurses. The broad categories of authorized fund use make Title V-A a block grant, with a prohibition against SEAs influencing LEA decisions on fund utilization. The ESEA Title V-A funds, authorized in 1981, provide flexibility to LEAs for various educational activities. A study found that recipient LEAs used funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and targeted academic services. The ESEA Title V-A funds, authorized in 1981, provide flexibility to LEAs for educational activities. Large LEAs often use funds for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts. However, resources are not frequently targeted at high-need pupils or schools. Appropriations for Title V-A have steeply declined over the years, with zero funds provided in FY2008, possibly leading to the program's termination. The lack of constituencies advocating for increased funding contributes to this trend. Title V-A funding has been supplemented by funds transferred under REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. Limited information on its effects has reduced incentives to maintain funding levels. The program receives less favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs with demonstrated targeting or improved educational outcomes. ESEA Title V-A was amended by NCLB to require annual summaries on how assistance contributes to student achievement. SEAs and LEAs can increase funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing states and LEAs to transfer funds from other federal programs into Title V-A. Additional provisions for consolidated applications and funds consolidation for SEA or LEA administration are also provided in ESEA Title IX. These flexibility measures aim to provide administrative convenience and increased flexibility for states and LEAs. The NCLB amendments allow LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer only 30% of their grants for activities addressing AYP standards. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs, except for administrative funds. The NCLB amendments allow LEAs to transfer funds among four ESEA programs, with limitations on the amount based on meeting AYP requirements. States can also transfer funds among specified programs, excluding administrative funds. The Transferability authority for states is limited, with approximately $3.5 billion in funds subject to this authority. LEAs can make transfers without specific approval, but all program requirements still apply to the transferred funds. The NCLB amendments allow LEAs to transfer funds among four ESEA programs, with limitations based on meeting AYP requirements. States can also transfer funds among specified programs, excluding administrative funds. Transferability authority for states is limited to approximately $3.5 billion in funds. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with confusion at the LEA level between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. LEAs most often move funds out of ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A. Many LEAs use Transferability to compensate for reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, target resources on schools failing to meet progress standards, or utilize funds with flexibility. Reasons for not participating include lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, or insufficient funding levels. A new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate state administration and activity funds under various education programs. State and Local Technology Grants (Title II-D-1), Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities (Title IV-A-1), 21st Century Community Learning Centers (Title IV-B), and Innovative Programs block grant (Title V-A) programs can be consolidated under the \"State-Flex\" authority for any ESEA program purpose. States must meet AYP requirements to maintain authority, with the option for renewal after five years. Selected states must enter into agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty areas. LEAs can consolidate funds under local flexibility authority. Under the \"Local-Flex\" authority, up to 80 LEAs can consolidate funds under various ESEA programs. Only one state, Florida, has been granted State-Flex authority but withdrew before implementation. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. LEAs can consolidate funds from various ESEA programs for five years, with 4% for administration. Renewal depends on meeting goals and compliance. Certain requirements cannot be waived, and annual reports on fund usage are mandatory. The Local-Flex program allows LEAs to consolidate funds from ESEA programs for five years with 4% for administration. Seattle, Washington, the only LEA to participate, had its eligibility suspended for failing to make AYP. Despite competitions for State-Flex and Local-Flex authority, there has been little interest. Barriers to participation include additional responsibilities, limited benefits, organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination. The Local-Flex program allows LEAs to consolidate funds from ESEA programs for five years with 4% for administration. Seattle, Washington, the only LEA to participate, had its eligibility suspended for failing to make AYP. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities began on March 18, 2004, with no deadline. Participants would receive preference in future grant competitions for demonstrating comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement. State-Flex and Local-Flex are relatively broad, allowing funds to be used for any purpose authorized under ESEA programs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs under ESEA allow for flexibility in fund usage, with a limited number of states and LEAs eligible to participate. Despite invitations to compete, interest has been low. State-Flex authority has limitations on fund usage for administrative responsibilities, with varying percentages allocated for state-level activities. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs under ESEA offer flexibility in fund usage, with varying percentages allocated for different programs. Participating states and LEAs have influence over fund consolidation and usage, with some limitations on flexibility. The final provisions of H.R. 1, enacted as the NCLB, are similar to the House version authorizing local flexibility demonstrations. The Senate version proposed broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which was not included in the final legislation. The Senate's proposal would have provided greater flexibility with increased outcome accountability compared to the State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The scope of the Senate's flexibility/performance agreement authority was limited to 7 participating states. The authority under the NCLB allowed for a maximum of 7 participating states and 25 LEAs, with program requirements such as civil rights and fiscal accountability. The flexibility authority covered a broad range of ESEA programs with higher funding levels, including Title I-A grants. Participating states could reallocate funds among LEAs as long as they targeted poor children effectively. State-Flex did not provide similar reallocation authority. The Senate version of H.R. 1 required states and LEAs to exceed AYP goals significantly, ensuring achievement gains beyond state standards. This outcome accountability element aims to prevent random variations in pupil scores. The report also analyzes common themes of flexibility in NCLB, emphasizing the ability for states and LEAs to prioritize federal aid funds according to their needs. The special flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to use federal aid funds according to their priorities, with some program requirements waived in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. These authorities, particularly those under NCLB, aim to increase accountability while providing flexibility in ESEA programs. The ESEA and related federal programs offer flexibility through various authorities, with REAP Flex being the most utilized by small, rural LEAs. Reporting requirements on the use of flexibility and its impact on pupil achievement exist, but specific impacts are not well-documented. Concerns remain about the restrictions and administrative burdens of current flexibility authorities. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is limited to schools with above-average low-income pupil rates. Waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. Transferability authority allows up to 50% fund transfer, with requirements still to be met. Rural LEA flexibility is for low-enrollment LEAs. State-Flex authority is limited to seven states. Local-Flex authority affects a limited range of programs. The limited flexibility provided by Local-Flex and State-Flex authorities has resulted in low participation rates. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards, cannot be waived. Flexibility authorities do not include Title I-A and do not allow for fund reallocation among LEAs. The 1999 GAO report found that existing flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens faced by states and LEAs. LEAs associated with requirements under IDEA, ADA, child nutrition, and environmental regulations. Some SEA staff find limited value in Ed-Flex due to few waivers, while others see it as promoting innovation. New authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 also seen as beneficial. Flexibility in federal program requirements has increased, especially in ESEA Title I-A programs. NCLB emphasizes outcome accountability but allows more flexibility in fund usage for LEAs and schools. The NCLB program consolidated various education programs, providing states and LEAs with more flexibility in fund usage. The special authorities for waivers were not widely utilized, and previous requirements that were frequently waived were later eliminated or made less restrictive. Limited information is available on the use of waivers, with some not clearly related to innovation or reform. The ESEA Title IX-D authority allowed a few states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress. The ESEA Title IX-D authority allowed a limited number of states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress (AYP) under the NCLB program. Recent studies found that flexibility authorities were mainly used to move funds between different education programs to compensate for reductions in formula grants and target resources on schools failing to meet AYP standards. Pre-NCLB flexibility authorities were often used to waive certain requirements. The late-1990s saw the use of flexibility authorities to waive various requirements related to ESEA Title I-A programs, including thresholds for low-income pupil percentages, targeting funds on high-poverty schools, deadlines for standards adoption, and limitations on fund use for teacher programs. Questions have been raised about granting schoolwide program authority to schools with low poverty rates, as it may limit program scope. The use of waivers in ESEA Title I-A programs may disperse funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the impact on high-poverty schools. There is no clear evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs for disadvantaged students. Waivers have been used to delay meeting deadlines for program requirements, potentially undermining accountability measures. LEAs and states have requested waivers to focus teacher hiring on specific requirements in programs like CSR and Eisenhower. Following the enactment of NCLB, waivers were frequently requested to accommodate specific limitations on fund usage in ESEA Title I-A programs. The NCLB made some previously common uses of flexibility authorities less relevant, as programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. The ESEA Title IX-D program has granted few waivers post-NCLB era. Limited information is available on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement. Anecdotal information on achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers was included in a 1999 ED report. Supporters of flexibility authorities point to broader evidence of their impact on public education systems. The 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex concluded that it supports standards-based reform by facilitating coordination, streamlining administration, and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement. Limited data shows the impact on pupil achievement outcomes in states, LEAs, or schools with flexibility granted. The ED report on Ed-Flex supports standards-based reform by facilitating coordination and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement. However, there is limited information available on the use and impact of special flexibility authorities granted by ED, making it difficult to evaluate their significance and benefits. The outcome accountability requirements associated with special flexibility authorities involve goals set by states and LEAs, as well as meeting state-established AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. Some programs may not have a direct link between flexibility authority and outcome accountability. States granted Ed-Flex authority varied in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals. The GAO study found that many Ed-Flex states lacked specific outcome goals for LEAs and schools granted waivers. Oversight by the Department of Education was limited, with varying levels of detail in the annual reports submitted by states. The current flexibility authorities do not impose substantial additional outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements, focusing more on consequences for failing to meet general outcome standards. The outcome accountability requirements for states with special flexibility authority under the NCLB are emphasized, with an additional incentive to meet these requirements to maintain eligibility for flexibility authority. The increased outcome accountability is limited but aligns with the nature of special flexibility authorities. NCLB expands outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools. Proponents argue that increased flexibility can lead to improved pupil outcomes without the need for additional accountability requirements. Critics question the justification for granting flexibility without additional accountability measures. Critics defend accountability requirements as national priorities and express concerns about insufficient accountability provisions in special flexibility authorities."
