    "content": "The \"FHA Improvement Act of 1994\" aims to simplify and streamline the loan criteria and approval process for the single family housing mortgage insurance program. Congress believes this will promote first-time and affordable homeownership without increasing risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Flexible lending products can also be developed under the program. The National Housing Act is amended to ensure that the dollar amount limitation for any area is not less than the greater of the limitation in effect on the date of the FHA Improvement Act of 1994 or the average area purchase price determined under the Internal Revenue Code. The dollar amount limitation for any area under the National Housing Act will be adjusted annually based on the Constant Quality Housing Price Index. SEC. 4. CALCULATION OF DOWNPAYMENT. Section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act is amended to adjust the maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgages based on property appraised values. The changes include specific percentages based on the property value and the mortgage insurance premium paid at the time of insurance. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF INSURANCE BY MORTGAGEES. Amends Section 215 of the National Housing Act to allow mortgagees to endorse mortgages for insurance without specific approval from the Secretary. SEC. 6.

Definition of family member includes child, parent, or grandparent of the mortgagor. The definition of a \"child\" for mortgage purposes includes a legally adopted son or daughter, a child placed for legal adoption, and a foster child, in addition to a son, stepson, daughter, or stepdaughter of the mortgagor. SEC. 8. APPROVAL OF CONDOMINIUM PROJECTS. Section 234 of the National Housing Act is amended to allow mortgage insurance for multifamily projects or condominium units approved by a government-sponsored housing enterprise. The mortgage must comply with specific requirements outlined in the section. The term 'approved by a government-sponsored housing enterprise' in subsection (d) refers to a multifamily housing project with a condominium ownership structure meeting the enterprise's mortgage standards. 'Condominium unit' is defined as a 1-family dwelling unit with an interest in common areas. 'Government-sponsored housing enterprise' is defined as an entity related to housing projects. The term 'enterprise' refers to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. SEC. 9. INSURANCE OF 2-STEP SINGLE FAMILY MORTGAGES. Amendment to Title II of the National Housing Act to include a new section on 2-step single family mortgages. The Secretary may insure mortgages for properties with dwellings for 1 to 4 families, with fixed or adjustable interest rates for at least the first 5 years. Adjustments can be made by the mortgagee after this initial period. The effective rate of interest for insured mortgages can be adjusted based on a specified national interest rate index. Any adjustments must not result in a total mortgage term exceeding 40 years. Adjustments can be made through changes in the monthly payment amount, outstanding principal balance, or mortgage term. The adjustable rate for insured mortgages is tied to a national interest rate index, with annual adjustments limited to 1% per increase and a maximum increase of 5% over the term. The Secretary can only insure mortgages after ensuring the risk does not exceed that of fixed-rate mortgages of equivalent terms. Regulations require mortgagees to provide information on mortgage features. Regulations require mortgagees to provide a written explanation of the features of the 2-step mortgage at the time of loan application. The total number of mortgages insured under this section cannot exceed 10% of the total insured by the Secretary in the previous fiscal year. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will conduct a study on reducing upfront and annual premiums for mortgage insurance under the single-family home mortgage insurance program. The study will also assess the impact of these methods on the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's financial stability. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment."
