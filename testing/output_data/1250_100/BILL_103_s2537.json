    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness Act\" and includes sections on the short title, table of contents, findings, purpose, definitions, general rule, applicability, preemption, jurisdiction of Federal courts, and effective date. The Congress finds that multiple punitive damages for harms from a single act can deplete a defendant's assets, hinder claimants' compensation, and lead to unfair punishment for the same conduct. Multiple imposition of punitive damages is a concern raised by judges and commentators, as it may impede global settlement negotiations and hinder the resolution of mass tort claims. Federal and State trial courts lack the authority to address this issue, and individual State legislatures can only provide a partial remedy due to their limited power over punitive damages in other States. The purpose of this Act is to address the issue of multiple imposition of punitive damages in interstate commerce. It defines punitive damages as those awarded to punish or deter certain behavior, specifies specific findings of fact, and clarifies the term \"claimant\" to include various parties involved in civil actions. SEC. 6. GENERAL RULE. Punitive damages are generally prohibited in civil actions if they have already been awarded against the defendant for the same act. However, punitive damages may be awarded if substantial new evidence of additional wrongful behavior is presented or if the previous award was deemed insufficient to deter similar behavior in the future. The court may impose limitations on the award of punitive damages in such cases. The court, pursuant to subsection (b), must make specific findings of fact to support the punitive damage award, reduce the award by previous punitive damages paid by the defendant, and prohibit disclosure of the court's actions to the jury. SEC. 7 of the Act applies to civil actions seeking punitive damages for the same act or conduct for which punitive damages have already been awarded, with exceptions for damages awarded under specific statutes. The Act supersedes any Federal or State laws on punitive damages recovery, except in certain cases. Federal courts do not have jurisdiction over civil actions under this Act based on specific sections of the United States Code. SEC. 8 specifies the effective date of the Act. SEC. 8 of the Act specifies that it will take effect on the date of its enactment and will apply to pending civil actions as well as actions commenced on or after that date."
