    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States annually, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Swimming in contaminated waters leads to millions of Americans falling ill each year, resulting in significant economic losses. Many sewer systems lack routine monitoring for early detection of contamination. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are needed to prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. Public health authorities are not routinely informed of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system. Monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are necessary to prevent public health threats. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement a system for timely detection and notification of sanitary sewer overflows to protect public health. Owners must alert the public within 24 hours of an overflow and notify health authorities immediately. Publicly owned treatment works must promptly notify authorities of any sanitary sewer overflow that poses a significant health risk. Owners must report the overflow to the Administrator or State within 24 hours orally or electronically, and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, and steps taken to address and prevent future occurrences. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, overflow duration, location, cleanup responses, and mitigation actions. States must then report this information to the Administrator. The State must annually report a summary of sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends Section 603(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAmends Section 607 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize $2,200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 through 2012."
