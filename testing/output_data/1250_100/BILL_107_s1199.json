    "content": "The purpose of this section is to prevent the abandonment of marginal oil and gas wells responsible for half of the domestic production of oil and gas in the United States by providing a tax credit for producing oil and gas from these wells. The marginal well production credit under section 38 provides a credit amount of $3 per barrel of qualified crude oil production and 50 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas production. These amounts are subject to reduction as oil and gas prices increase. The marginal well production credit provides a credit amount for qualified crude oil and natural gas production. The reference price for a taxable year is based on the previous calendar year. Dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation, and the reference price is determined for each calendar year. Under section 29(d)(2)(C), qualified crude oil and natural gas production from marginal wells are subject to limitations based on production amounts. Production exceeding 1,095 barrels or barrel equivalents in a taxable year does not qualify for the credit. The limitations for short taxable years and wells not in production the entire year are proportionately reduced based on the number of days. A marginal well is defined as a domestic well with production treated as marginal production. The tax code defines a marginal well as a domestic well with specific production criteria, including average daily production and water production rates. The terms 'crude oil', 'natural gas', 'domestic', and 'barrel' are defined in section 613A(e). A barrel equivalent is defined as 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas to 1 barrel of crude oil. Ownership rules apply to marginal wells with multiple owners. The tax code outlines rules for determining qualifying crude oil or natural gas production from a marginal well with multiple owners. The taxpayer's revenue interest ratio to all operating interest owners determines the qualifying production. The credit can only be claimed on production attributable to the holder of an operating interest, and no credit is allowed if the well is eligible for another credit unless the taxpayer elects not to claim it. The tax code allows for a marginal oil and gas well production credit, which is treated as business credit under the Internal Revenue Code. Special rules apply for this credit, including separate application of sections 38 and 39 with respect to the credit. The tax code allows for a marginal oil and gas well production credit, which is treated as a business credit under the Internal Revenue Code. Special rules apply for this credit, including separate application of sections 38 and 39. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply in applying paragraph (1) to the credit, and the limitation under paragraph (1) is reduced by the credit allowed under subsection (a) for the taxable year. The tax code is amended to include a 10-year carryback provision for the marginal oil and gas well production credit. This credit is treated separately from other business credits and allows for an extended carryback period for unused credits. The tax code is amended to include a 10-year carryback provision for the marginal oil and gas well production credit, allowing for an extended carryback period for unused credits. Additionally, Section 29(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended for taxpayer election coordination. The tax code amendments include a 10-year carryback provision for the marginal oil and gas well production credit, effective for production in taxable years after December 31, 2001. Additionally, there is an election option for expensing geological and geophysical expenditures and delay rental payments. The tax code allows for an election to expense geological and geophysical expenditures for domestic oil and gas wells, treating them as deductible business expenses in the year they are incurred. The amendments made by this subsection apply to expenses paid or incurred after the enactment date. Taxpayers can elect to amortize suspended expenses over a 36-month period for expenses paid before the enactment date. Taxpayers can elect to expense delay rental payments for domestic oil and gas wells as a deduction in the taxable year in which paid or incurred. This applies to expenses after the enactment date and allows for the deferral of drilling under an oil or gas lease. The amendments made by this subsection apply to payments made after the enactment date. Taxpayers can elect to amortize suspended expenses over a 36-month period for expenses described in section 263(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The cost of a property or expenses described in section 263(k) of the Internal Revenue Code has not been included or deducted."
