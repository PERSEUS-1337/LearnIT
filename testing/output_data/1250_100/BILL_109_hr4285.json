The Congress finds that detection canines are crucial for homeland security, as they can quickly detect explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans in various locations. There is a shortage of detection canines available to assist law enforcement personnel, despite the authorization of new Border Patrol agents. Detection canines are crucial for homeland security, used in airports, mass transit systems, urban search and rescue, and securing National Special Security Events. Various agencies deploy canines to detect explosives, narcotics, and protect Federal buildings and sea ports. The Subcommittee on Homeland Security held a hearing on the use of detection canines in support of homeland security. Several Federal agencies, a local transit police department, a private canine security company, and a university-based canine training center highlighted a shortage of trained detection canines for homeland security activities. In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines by at least 25 percent in various agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, and Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Coordination and enhancement of canine training programs is required. The Secretary of Homeland Security is mandated to coordinate and consolidate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing resources efficiently, and explore partnerships with other agencies and organizations to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement. A report on the Department's plan for this coordination must be submitted to relevant congressional committees within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. The Department plans to coordinate and consolidate its canine training programs, including increasing coordination with other Federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Secretary of Homeland Security prioritizes increasing domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism missions, consulting with other agencies to consolidate procurement and reduce costs."
