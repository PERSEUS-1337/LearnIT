    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act\". Congress finds that it is crucial for the United States to secure access to reliable energy sources, as the country heavily relies on foreign oil imports, with a significant portion coming from OPEC member states. These countries have used their oil supplies to manipulate US policy in the past, leading to economic repercussions. Additionally, some of these countries use oil revenues to fund terrorism and anti-US propaganda. The Department of Energy predicts a 33% increase in the US's dependence on foreign oil over the next 20 years. A 10-cent rise in gasoline prices would lead to an additional $18 billion outflow to oil-exporting nations. The US should reduce its reliance on nations that do not share its interests and values. Israel, a democratic ally of the US since 1948, promotes values of peace, freedom, and justice. Cooperation between the US and Israel, like the Arrow Missile project, benefits both countries' security. The special relationship between Israel and the United States is demonstrated through jointly-funded cooperative programs in scientific research and development. These programs have led to significant breakthroughs in various fields such as life sciences, medicine, agriculture, and renewable energy sources. Israeli scientists have been pioneers in alternative renewable energy research. Israeli scientists have made breakthroughs in alternative renewable energy sources, including a cathode using hexavalent iron salts for rechargeable batteries, a technique to increase solar energy efficiency for hydrogen generation, and a novel membrane for direct-oxidant fuel cells. Collaboration between the United States and Israel in this field is highlighted. Collaboration in the field of research and development of alternative renewable energy sources between the United States and Israel is mutually beneficial. The grant program is outlined in Section 3. The Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy and International Affairs will establish a grant program for eligible joint ventures between Israeli and U.S. private businesses or academic persons. These ventures will work on projects promoting cooperation in alternative energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. To apply for a grant, eligible entities must submit an application to BIRD or BSF. To apply for a grant under this program, eligible entities must submit an application to BIRD or BSF with required information. The Directors of BIRD and BSF will review applications and select recipients based on established criteria. The grant amount will be determined by BIRD or BSF, and recipients must submit a report within 6 months detailing fund usage and project success. SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY ADVISORY BOARD. Established in the Department of Energy is an International Energy Advisory Board (referred to as the Advisory Board) with duties to establish grant criteria and determine grant amounts for recipients. The Advisory Board consists of 4 members, including appointments by the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, as well as two Israeli citizens appointed by the Secretary of Energy after consultation with Israeli government officials.
