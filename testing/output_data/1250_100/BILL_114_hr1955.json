    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading. The Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights nutrient removal technology as an effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in wastewater discharge. Priority is given to facilities where nutrient removal technologies would have the greatest impact. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program aims to reduce nutrient load at discharge points in the Great Lakes System, align with Annex 4 objectives, and provide grants to cover up to 55% of installation costs for approved applications from Great Lakes States or municipalities. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program covers installation of nutrient removal technologies at eligible municipal wastewater treatment facilities within the Great Lakes System, meeting specific criteria for capacity and location. Authorization of appropriations for the Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program includes $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020, with 4 percent allocated for administrative costs."
