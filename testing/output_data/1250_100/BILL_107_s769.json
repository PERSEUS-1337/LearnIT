    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Carbon Conservation Act\" and includes a Carbon Sequestration Program. The International Carbon Conservation Act establishes a Carbon Sequestration Program allowing project sponsors to propose projects to the implementing panel. The panel, within the National Institute of Standards and Technology, includes various government officials and experts in carbon sequestration. The Chief of the Forest Service chairs the panel, and a carbon sequestration project is defined as one located outside the United States. The Carbon Sequestration Program allows project sponsors to propose projects located outside the US, lasting at least 30 years, designed to increase carbon sequestration, and accepted by the implementing panel. Proposals must include a needs assessment and identify benefits under specific criteria and guidelines. The proposal for a carbon sequestration project must include an agreement to carry out specific practices and provide verification of compliance with approved standards. A needs assessment, developed in cooperation with various organizations, evaluates the need for the project and the sponsor's ability to implement carbon sequestration practices. The carbon sequestration project proposal requires the project sponsor to contract with other entities to carry out additional carbon sequestration practices that contribute to a positive reduction of greenhouse gases over a 30-year period. Compliance with approved standards must be verified. The project sponsor must provide verification through a third party that the project is sequestering carbon as per the approved proposal, including annual audits, site verifications every 5 years, and necessary inspections. The Chief of the Forest Service will develop criteria for evaluating the benefits of carbon sequestration practices to prioritize and determine project acceptability. Carbon sequestration investment credits will not be allocated to projects that do not meet the criteria. Projects eligible for carbon sequestration investment credits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 must prioritize native forest preservation, reforestation of former forest land, biodiversity enhancement, greenhouse gas emissions prevention, soil erosion management, soil fertility restoration, and project duration. Guidelines for quantifying benefits are also provided. Under the carbon sequestration program, guidelines are established for quantifying the amount of carbon sequestered by projects. These guidelines include methodologies for measuring carbon sequestered, ensuring project duration, verifying additional sequestration, evaluating displacement of deforestation, and setting standards for project sponsors. The guidelines for the carbon sequestration program include consultation with experts, using information from the Energy Information Administration, and establishing verification standards with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will develop forms to monitor carbon sequestration improvements and report on them. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. The Export-Import Bank of the United States can provide financing for carbon sequestration projects outside the US, while the Overseas Private Investment Corporation can offer investment insurance for such projects if approved by the implementing panel."
