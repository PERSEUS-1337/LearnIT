    "content": "The process of appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is outlined in the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The President nominates a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate for a lifetime appointment. The most recent nomination was Merrick B. Garland by President Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Majority Leader McConnell emphasized the importance of the American people having a voice in the selection of the next Justice. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Senator Chuck Grassley, believes the next Supreme Court Justice should be chosen by the American people through the upcoming presidential election. Minority Leader Harry Reid urges the Senate to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling their Constitutional duty. Despite Obama's call for a fair hearing and vote, the Senate took no action on Garland's nomination, marking the first time since 1866 that a Supreme Court nominee received no formal Senate consideration. President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, did not receive formal Senate consideration and the nomination was returned at the end of the 114th Congress. President Trump nominated Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which is currently pending before the Senate. This report analyzes the frequency of Supreme Court vacancies, compares the length of the Scalia vacancy to past vacancies, and addresses other related issues. Since President George Washington's initial appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, vacancies have occurred on average every two years. In the post-War period, vacancies have occurred every 2.4 years, and since 1980, slightly less frequently at every 3.1 years. The time between the vacancies created by the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 and Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest period ever on the Court, at 2,054 days. Justices on the Supreme Court typically hold lifetime appointments. Justices on the Supreme Court hold lifetime appointments, allowing them to serve until they voluntarily step down or pass away. Historically, vacancies on the Court have occurred due to various reasons, with 42% resulting from the death of a sitting Justice. However, over the past 60 years, vacancies due to a Justice's death have been relatively rare, accounting for only 8% of vacancies since 1956. Since 1956, only 8% of vacancies on the Supreme Court were due to the death of a sitting Justice. Prior to that, vacancies were more commonly caused by a Justice's death, with 59% occurring between 1791 and 1899, and 43% between 1900 and 1955. On average, vacancies last approximately 4 months before a nominee is approved by the Senate. The average length of vacancies on the Supreme Court has decreased over time. Prior to 1900, vacancies lasted around 5.4 months, while since 1900, vacancies have lasted around 2.5 months. As of March 1, 2017, the Scalia vacancy has lasted for 382 days, making it the seventh longest vacancy in the Court's history. The Scalia vacancy is the longest of the 80 vacancies on the Court since 1861. The average length of time from nomination to final Senate action for Supreme Court vacancies has been 28 days since 1791. However, since 1956, nominations have waited an average of 67 days for final Senate action. Figure 3 shows the 10 longest nominations pending for a vacancy on the Supreme Court, with eight of the 10 nominations occurring since 1956. The Scalia vacancy is currently the seventh longest vacancy on the Court. The Scalia vacancy is the seventh longest vacancy on the Court. Judge Garland's nomination was pending for 293 days, the longest since 1791. Judge Gorsuch's nomination has been pending for 28 days. Six out of 10 nominations were not approved by the Senate. The vacancy created by Justice John McLean lasted 295 days, but the nomination for it was pending for only 3 days. Vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years are relatively uncommon, with a total of 16 vacancies out of 111 arising during such years. Unlike the Scalia vacancy, some vacancies occurred after the general election or had nominations submitted after the election. Since 1791, there have been a total of 9 vacancies, including the Scalia vacancy. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years where the vacancy arose before the election and a nomination was made before the election. The Scalia vacancy in 2016 was the first under these circumstances since 1932. Out of these 9 vacancies, 3 did not have the Senate approve the President's nominee. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years where the vacancy arose before the election. Out of these, 8 vacancies were confirmed by the Senate during the election year itself. The most recent example was in 1987 when Anthony M. Kennedy was nominated and confirmed in 1988. There have also been anticipated vacancies, such as in 1968 when President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas and Homer Thornberry. Chief Justice Warren did not step down until 1969, resulting in no vacancies in 1968. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years where the vacancy arose before the election. Out of these, 8 vacancies were confirmed by the Senate during the election year itself. The most recent example was in 1987 when Anthony M. Kennedy was nominated and confirmed in 1988. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there have been seven vacancies on the Supreme Court filled during a different administration, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies filled on the Court since 1791. The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration was in 1881. The Scalia vacancy, which occurred in 1862, reflects the longest period from a vacancy on the Supreme Court to when a President left office. Specifically, 342 days elapsed from the Scalia vacancy to when President Obama left office. Vacancies on the Supreme Court can last for an extended period, as seen with the Scalia vacancy during the Obama presidency, which lasted 342 days. Most departing Presidents nominate a replacement for vacancies, but not all vacancies are filled after the first nomination is submitted to the Senate. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations before being filled. The Scalia vacancy, lasting 342 days, is the most recent example. Figure 6 illustrates 12 vacancies since 1860 that needed more than one nomination, with six occurring between 1860 and 1899, one between 1900 and 1955, and five between 1956 and 2016. Six of these vacancies involved the Senate formally rejecting nominations in a floor vote. The Senate rejected nominations in floor votes for some vacancies, with four involving the President withdrawing nominations. The Scalia vacancy is unique as the nomination was returned to the President after the Senate took no action. Vacancies requiring multiple nominations generally lasted longer than the median vacancy length on the Court. The nominee approved by the Senate usually receives unanimous or nearly unanimous support, with most receiving zero or very few nay votes. Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006, received 42 nay votes, which was an exception to this pattern."
