The HERO Benefits Reform Act of 2016 amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to establish a presumption of proper officer actions. It allows for de novo review in appeals of claim denials by the Bureau and permits individuals to file a claim with the United States Court of Federal Claims if the Bureau fails to make a determination within one year. If the Bureau denies the original claim within 1 year, the individual can appeal to a hearing officer, and if a determination is not made within 180 days, further appeals can be made to the Director. The United States Court of Federal Claims will review a claim without considering any Bureau determinations, including those made by a hearing officer. If the Director does not make a determination on the original claim within 180 days, further appeals can be made. SEC. 4. TRANSPARENCY. Subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended by adding a new section for an annual report. The Bureau is required to submit an annual report to Congress and publicly publish it on their website within 60 days after each fiscal year. The report must include the number of claims filed, granted, and denied during the year, categorized by type of benefit sought and public safety officer. It should also detail the claims pending at the end of the year, along with reasons for delays in decision-making. The Attorney General is responsible for making this report available online. SEC. 5. EXTENDING PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER DEATH BENEFITS TO FIRE POLICE AND FIRE INVESTIGATORS. SEC. 5 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 amends Section 1204 to include fire police officers as officially recognized members of public safety agencies authorized to provide scene security or direct traffic during fire, rescue, or police emergencies. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 includes fire police officers as recognized members of public safety agencies for scene security or traffic control during emergencies. The definition of a fire investigator is expanded to include individuals authorized to conduct fire and explosion investigations. Technical amendments are made to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001."
