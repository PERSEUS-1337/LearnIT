The method achieves lower errors compared to previous models, enabling real-time multi-horizon forecasts for practical applications in the evolving smart grid. The modern grid faces challenges with strong fluctuations due to uncertainty, requiring real-time observability, control, and improved renewable generation forecast accuracy. ISOs with higher renewable penetration are struggling with short-term forecasting errors, leading to increased costs. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could result in $5 billion savings per year for WECC. The levels of solar power generation forecast accuracy are crucial for grid reliability and cost efficiency. Errors in short-term forecasts can lead to grid strain and balancing issues. Improving forecast accuracy is essential for integrating solar energy resources effectively. The paper reviews current forecasting approaches and highlights their shortcomings. The paper reviews current forecasting approaches for solar power generation, emphasizing the importance of accuracy for grid reliability and cost efficiency. The proposed unified architecture based on RNN introduces a novel algorithm to improve forecasting techniques. Different methods for renewable generation and electric load forecasting prediction are classified into five categories, including regressive methods and artificial intelligence techniques. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, including hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems and ANN, are used for solar radiation forecasting. NWP models have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution and lack of micro-scale physics understanding. Regional NWP models are downscaled for improved site-specific forecasts to mitigate these limitations. The limitations of solar irradiance forecasting using satellite-based remote sensing include the inability to accurately determine radiance values under different sky conditions and the reliance on empirical or statistical algorithms that do not require precise atmospheric parameters. Ground-based solar data is needed for satellite statistical algorithms that model solar radiation attenuation through the atmosphere. Short-term solar forecasting research has shifted towards timeseries analysis using statistical models and AI techniques due to limitations of NWP and sensing models. Statistical techniques include linear stationary models, nonlinear stationary models, and linear nonstationary models. Conventional statistical techniques have advantages over NWP and sensing methods but are limited by assumptions of normality, linearity, and variable independence. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can capture complex non-linear behaviors in higher dimensional settings, especially when considering exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, and pressure in solar forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used in solar forecasting to model relationships between exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, and pressure with Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are effective in solving complex problems, but Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have not been explored for solar forecasting. RNNs capture sequence dynamics using cyclic feedback connections, unlike feedforward neural networks which assume data point independence. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, optimization techniques, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for solar forecasting. Two approaches using RNNs are proposed in this paper: a single algorithm for forecasting at different time horizons and a unified architecture for multi-time-horizon forecasting of solar irradiance. The proposed method utilizes RNN architecture to predict solar irradiance values for multiple time horizons in real-time, addressing challenges in renewable energy applications. The RNN model incorporates directed edges spanning adjacent time steps to leverage past information in sequential data, enabling accurate forecasting based on live measured data. The RNN model utilizes three dimensions for input: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns in the vector per time-step, and Number of time-steps. In a multilayer feedforward neural network, the input vector is processed through neurons with activation functions to produce outputs for the next layer. The net input to the next layer is calculated using weights, previous outputs, and bias terms. The proposed RNN architecture uses ReLU as the activation function and unfolds the input at time t. It is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and Mean Squared Loss (MSE) as the loss function. Gradients are computed using BPTT and stochastic gradient descent is used for weight updates. The RMSE is calculated for benchmarking. The RNN aims to learn complex relationships between sequences of exogenous variables impacting solar irradiance, including non-linear factors like atmospheric conditions. The proposed RNN architecture uses ReLU as the activation function and is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) with Mean Squared Loss (MSE) as the loss function. The algorithm was tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites, with input features including various solar and atmospheric measurements. Global downwelling solar measurements were found to be crucial according to Dobbs. Global downwelling solar measurements are important for calculating Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at SURFRAD sites. Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar show a positive correlation. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the difference between target and output values in the neural network training process. Root Mean Squared Error is then calculated for benchmarking. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm involves importing site-specific data and merging it with clear sky global horizontal irradiance values from the Bird Model. The dataset is then split into train and testing sets, with missing values replaced by the mean or neighborhood values. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify and eliminate outliers, and a Recurrent Neural Network model is defined with specified architectural parameters. The model is trained and tested iteratively. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm involves training and testing the model iteratively using data from SURFRAD observation sites in various locations. The algorithm predicts for different time horizons independently, with RMSE values indicating model performance. The proposed architecture and algorithm for forecasting solar radiation at SURFRAD sites outperforms other machine learning algorithms in terms of RMSE values for all forecasting horizons. This method involves developing one model per site to predict for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour horizons simultaneously, a unique approach not seen in existing literature. The overall forecasting accuracy is quantified by calculating the mean RMSE values, showing significantly lower errors compared to previous methods. The proposed method for solar forecasting outperforms other algorithms in RMSE values for short-term predictions. It can predict for multiple time horizons simultaneously, making it relevant for industry applications. AI, especially deep neural networks, is promising for predictive analysis with the increasing availability of solar data. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture utilizes AI for high-fidelity solar forecasting, outperforming traditional Machine Learning methods. It can generate multi-time-scale predictions and has low forward inference time, making it a robust real-time forecasting engine. Further improvements can be made through hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture for high-fidelity solar forecasting outperforms traditional Machine Learning methods. Future research could explore extending the architecture with LSTM cells for intra-hour forecasting horizons."
