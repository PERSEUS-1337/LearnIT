    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act\". Congress acknowledges the substantial volume of electronic devices in the United States, with over 2 billion sold since 1980. Only 15 to 20 percent of discarded devices are recycled, despite the potential to recover valuable materials. Challenges remain in recycling electronic devices due to cost and proper material separation. The export of unwanted electronic devices to developing countries poses health and environmental risks due to crude recycling methods. Challenges in increasing recyclability can be addressed by improving logistics, technology, and design of electronic devices. Public education on responsible recycling could boost participation in recycling programs. The development of tools and technologies to increase the lifespan of electronic devices and promote safe reuse would decrease environmental impact and increase recyclability. Accurately assessing environmental impacts and quantifying them better would help determine the best end-of-life management options for electronic devices. SEC. 3. ELECTRONIC DEVICE ENGINEERING RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. The Administrator will award multiyear grants to consortia for research on managing environmental impacts of electronic devices and developing scientists, engineers, and technicians in the field. Research will focus on improving device collection and recycling efficiency, finding new uses for materials recovered from devices, creating eco-friendly alternatives to hazardous materials in devices, and developing methods for safe disposal of hazardous materials. The grants awarded under this section will focus on improving product design and assembly for electronic devices to facilitate refurbishment, reuse, and recycling. Lifecycle analyses will be conducted to assess environmental impacts, and strategies will be developed to extend the lifecycle of devices and promote safe reuse. Additionally, barriers to recycling and reuse will be identified, and efforts will be made to increase awareness and consumer acceptance of responsible recycling practices. Grants will be awarded based on merit and through a competitive application process. The application for grants under this section must include details about the research project, its relevance to electronic device recycling, feasibility of implementing research results, and promotion of collaboration among scientists. Research results will be disseminated through the development of best practices or training materials for the electronic device industry. The for-profit entity in the consortium must contribute at least 10% of the total research project cost. The Administrator is required to protect proprietary information provided by any person or entity and ensure proper protections are in place within the consortium. The Administrator must protect proprietary information within the consortium and may require funds to be returned if information is disclosed. A biennial report to Congress must list grants awarded, consortium entities, research projects, results, and adoption success. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations for the electronics industry: \n- $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2010\n- $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2011\n- $22,000,000 for fiscal year 2012. SEC. 4. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT ON ELECTRONIC DEVICE RECYCLING. The Administrator will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to produce a report on opportunities and barriers related to increasing electronic device recyclability and safety within a year of this Act's enactment. This includes addressing recycling methods, designing devices for reuse, reducing hazardous materials, and assessing environmental and health risks. The report will identify gaps in current research and training programs for electronic device recycling, recommend areas for additional research resources, and address regulatory barriers to implementing best practices and technological innovations. SEC. 5. ENGINEERING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Administrator will award grants to higher education institutions to develop curricula incorporating environmental design principles for training engineers and professionals in electronic device industries. Minority serving institutions will be reached out to for grant information and application assistance. Grants awarded under this section will enhance engineering curriculum to include environmental design principles for electronic devices, focusing on recyclability. Activities include developing curriculum, creating research opportunities, establishing certificate programs, and offering continuing education for professionals. An institution of higher education seeking a grant under this section must submit an application to the Administrator with required information. Authorized appropriations for this section are $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, $5,150,000 for fiscal year 2011, and $5,304,000 for fiscal year 2012. The Director will establish a physical property database for environmentally friendly alternative materials in electronic devices. A strategic plan will be developed with industry input to prioritize and characterize materials. $3,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2012. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Consortium, Director, Electronic device, and Institution of higher education. These definitions are crucial for the implementation of the Act's provisions related to electronic devices and materials. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, while a \"minority serving institution\" is defined as an eligible institution under the same Act. The curr_chunk states that the bill was passed by the House of Representatives on April 22, 2009, with the attestation of Lorraine C. Miller, the Clerk."
