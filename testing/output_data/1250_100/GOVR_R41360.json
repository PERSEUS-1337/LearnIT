    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is the debate over restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The key questions revolve around whether recipients of U.S. assistance perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Congressional debates on these issues have been ongoing since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to prohibit abortion in the U.S. and attach provisions to appropriations measures banning abortion. Opponents have attached provisions to annual appropriations measures banning federal funds for abortions, both domestically and internationally. The Mexico City policy, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify no involvement in abortion, has been rescinded and reissued by various Administrations. President Obama rescinded it in January 2009. The Mexico City policy, which bans federal funds for abortions internationally, was rescinded by President Obama in January 2009 and reinstated by President Trump in January 2017. Congressional debates continue on abortion and family planning restrictions in foreign assistance, with some seeking to make the policy permanent law. Federal funding for these activities remains controversial, with ongoing interest from Congress. Legislation governing U.S. foreign aid includes restrictions on abortion and family planning programs. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is the main law authorizing different types of assistance. Congress has amended the FAA since its inception and has established new programs through separate acts. Since 1985, the FAA has not been comprehensively reauthorized, leading to debates and disagreements on controversial issues like abortion and family planning. Congress annually considers appropriations measures to set spending levels for foreign assistance accounts, with increasing significance in influencing aid distribution. Various requirements and restrictions, including family planning and abortion-related ones, are complex and not always immediately apparent in legislation. Amendments like the Helms and Biden provisions may be added to other foreign assistance-related bills for emphasis. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to have abortions. It clarifies restrictions on abortion funding and is listed in chronological order with other legislative restrictions on U.S. funding for abortion and family planning programs abroad. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and has been periodically enacted in foreign operations appropriations measures since FY1980. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and has been included in foreign operations appropriations measures since FY1980. Additionally, funds cannot be used for involuntary sterilizations or coercion, as stated in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes exceptions for funding abortions in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Peace Corps volunteers can have abortions with medical evacuation covered. The Biden amendment prohibits funding for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization in foreign assistance. The Siljander amendment, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities. Congress has modified the amendment over the years to maintain this restriction. The United States only funds family planning projects that offer a range of methods and services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. The provision, introduced by Senator Dennis DeConcini in 1985, is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. It applies to family planning assistance funded through all accounts under that act. The FAA prohibits funds from being used for countries or organizations that violate abortion or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision is included in annual foreign operations appropriations and applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized under part I of the FAA. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, further restricts funds for such purposes. The Kemp-Kasten amendment prohibits funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization, particularly targeting the UNFPA's program in China. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since FY1985 and requires a determination within 6 months of enactment, accompanied by evidence and criteria. The United States has not consistently funded UNFPA due to concerns about its program in China violating the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing its commitment to international family planning and women's health. The Trump Administration later determined that UNFPA supported coercive abortion in China. Congress has imposed additional conditions on funding for UNFPA, including in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Act requires funds not available for UNFPA to be transferred to Global Health Programs for family planning and reproductive health activities. UNFPA cannot use funds for a program in China and must keep U.S. contributions separate. The Secretary of State must report on fund withholding and deduct funds if UNFPA budgets for China. Representative Bob Livingston introduced an amendment in 1986 to prohibit this. Livingston introduced an amendment in FY1987 appropriations to prevent discrimination against organizations supporting natural family planning methods when awarding grants. This is related to the DeConcini amendment, which requires funding for family planning projects offering a range of methods. The provision ensures that organizations complying with the DeConcini amendment cannot be discriminated against when receiving grants. The Leahy amendment, introduced in 1994, clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding family planning assistance. It addresses concerns that providing information or counseling about pregnancy options could violate the Helms amendment. The amendment allows for the provision of information or counseling about family planning, consistent with local law. The Tiahrt amendment, enacted in 1998, directs voluntary family planning projects supported by the United States to comply with specific requirements. It prohibits quotas or numerical targets for births and states that funds shall only be available to projects meeting these criteria. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits quotas or numerical targets for births in voluntary family planning projects supported by the United States. It also prohibits the payment of incentives for becoming a family planning acceptor and ensures that individuals have the right to access health care regardless of their decision on family planning services. Family planning acceptors must be provided with comprehensive information on the health benefits and risks of their chosen method. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits quotas or incentives for family planning projects supported by the United States. It aims to ensure individuals have access to healthcare regardless of their family planning decisions. Representative Tiahrt introduced the amendment in response to reports of forced sterilizations in Peru with little information on alternative contraception methods, leading to adverse effects and even death. The Tiahrt amendment was implemented to prevent complications from unsanitary sterilizations and ensure U.S. foreign assistance does not support such practices. USAID issued guidance on implementing the requirements for voluntary family planning projects. Violations of the amendment were reported in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 found no further violations. The Tiahrt amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, applying to family planning assistance funded through all accounts. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" restricts U.S. family planning aid to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. It has been implemented and reversed through executive branch actions, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The policy was first issued by President Reagan in 1984 and remains a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance. The Mexico City policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, restricts U.S. funds from being used for abortion as a method of family planning. Foreign NGOs receiving USAID grants could use their own funds for abortion-related activities, but had to maintain separate accounts for U.S. money to show compliance. The policy was rescinded by President Clinton in 1993, reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001, and expanded in 2003 to include all assistance for voluntary population planning to foreign NGOs. President Bush instituted exceptions for voluntary population planning provided to foreign NGOs, including cases of rape, incest, threats to the mother's life, and postabortion care. President Obama revoked this policy in 2009, citing its negative impact on family planning programs. President Trump reinstated the policy in 2017, expanding it to include global health assistance. The Trump Administration implemented the \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy in 2017 to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not support organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This policy applies to $8.8 billion in international health funding for programs addressing various health issues. Exemptions are provided for certain cases, similar to previous iterations of the policy. The Trump Administration implemented the \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy in 2017 to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not support organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Exemptions are provided for certain cases, such as rape, incest, and life-threatening conditions for the mother, as well as postabortion care. A six-month review in May 2018 acknowledged challenges in implementing the policy, with some recipients refusing to agree to the terms. The report highlighted the need to improve understanding of the policy's intent, implementation, compliance, and oversight. Further review of implementation is planned for December 15, 2018. USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization in 1982 to ensure funded services protect individuals' needs and rights. Requirements include informed consent, ready access to other family planning methods, and no incentive payments. The Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) issued by USAID in 1982 prohibits using payments as incentives for sterilization acceptance. It outlines guidelines for reasonable payments to voluntary sterilization (VS) service acceptors, providers, and referral agents, covering expenses like transportation, food, medicines, anesthesia, and lost wages. The fee structure for VS and other contraceptives should not create a financial incentive for sterilization over other methods. The USAID Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) prohibits using funds for voluntary sterilization activities, applying to various organizations and governments."
