    "content": "In 2003, the United States exported 1.3 million metric tons of beef and veal, valued at $3.9 billion, equivalent to 10% of the farm value of U.S. cattle. Beef exports grew rapidly from 1992 to 2003, increasing by 85%. After the 2003 BSE announcement, many countries banned U.S. beef imports, including Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. Canada and Mexico resumed imports in 2004, while Japan and Korea reopened their markets in 2006. The U.S. was the world's third-largest beef/veal exporter in 2003, with Australia and Brazil leading. However, U.S. market share dropped to 3% in 2004, while Brazil became the top exporter in 2007. Imports from Canada and Mexico represented an integrated North American market, with Canada being the major source of beef and cattle imports to the United States before its own BSE event in May 2003. The OIE recognized the United States, along with Canada, Switzerland, Taipei-China, Chile, and Brazil, as having \"controlled risk\" status for BSE in 2007. The Administration urges beef importing countries to acknowledge this determination and fully reopen their markets to U.S. beef, as U.S. exports gradually recover and market share for beef climbed to almost 9% in 2007. In 2007, U.S. beef exports reached over 771,000 MT valued at $2.7 billion. Mexico took 47% of the total volume, Canada took 17%, while Japan and Korea combined imported 9%. Korea lifted its prohibition on U.S. beef in 2006, accepting only boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age. Korea has only imported about 25,000 MT of U.S. beef since then. Korea rejected U.S. beef shipments due to bone fragments and dioxin levels. A new agreement in 2008 allowed all U.S. beef products, with restrictions on specified risk materials. Korea was to open first to beef from under-30-month old cattle. The Korean market was expected to open fully for U.S. beef trade, with special rules on feeding specified risk materials to animals. However, delays occurred due to backlash from consumers and opposition politicians. The Korean President promised to halt U.S. imports if another BSE case is reported and renegotiate the agreement. Additionally, beef from cattle older than 30 months was requested to be excluded. The Korean government requested that beef from cattle older than 30 months not be shipped, leading to disappointment from U.S. officials. The U.S. meat industry has lost billions in sales to Korea since 2003, with hopes of gaining a $1 billion annually. Access to Korea's beef market is a key issue in the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement debate. The U.S.-Korea free trade agreement (FTA) phases out Korean tariffs on beef over 15 years but does not address animal health barriers. Lawmakers are pushing for Korea to fully open its market for U.S. beef. An interim U.S. marketing program was announced with stricter regulations on beef products from cattle of 20 months or younger. The U.S. also agreed to allow Japanese beef into the market following certain conditions. The U.S. market reopened for Japanese beef imports in 2005 after meeting safety requirements. However, imports were halted in 2006 due to bone findings. The market reopened in 2006 after a review of U.S. slaughter facilities. U.S. officials are working to expand eligibility for more beef products in Japan amidst safety concerns and competition from Australia. The U.S. faces competition from Australia in the Japanese beef market, with Australia currently dominating imports. There is a potential constraint on expanding U.S. beef exports to Japan due to a possible beef import safeguard. Legislative initiatives in Congress depend on the pace of U.S. beef imports resuming in Japan. The U.S. reopened its border to Canadian live cattle in 2005, and in 2007, USDA announced a rule allowing for the importation of live cattle and other bovine species. The final rule MRR2 allows for the importation of live cattle and other bovine species from Canada for any use, effective November 19, 2007. This includes breeding animals born after March 1, 1999. The rule also permits imports of meat from Canadian cattle older than 30 months, previously suspended in a USDA rule from January 2005. Legal challenges by R-CALF USA to block the border opening were unsuccessful. Concerns about a flood of Canadian cull cattle exports to the U.S. were deemed unlikely by USDA analysis. The USDA analysis deemed concerns about a flood of Canadian cull cattle exports to the U.S. unlikely. U.S. imports of Canadian cattle had fallen but recovered to approximately 1.4 million in 2007. Opening the border to Canadian animals raised worries about competition and potential risks, but some believed it was necessary to show North American beef is safe. In the 110th Congress, resolutions of disapproval of MRR2 have been introduced in both chambers. Another bill, S. 1308, would prohibit imports of Canadian cattle over 30 months of age until mandatory country-of-origin labeling is implemented. The U.S. beef industry is less dependent on exports than Canada, cushioning the economic impact of BSE. In 2003, the U.S. ban on Canadian beef and cattle, along with tight supplies and strong demand, drove up U.S. beef prices. Despite the BSE case in December 2003, cattle prices stabilized due to demand and lower inventories from drought. Average U.S. fed steer prices were nearly $85 per cwt. in 2004, rising to nearly $92 by 2007. The impact of BSE on the U.S. beef industry led to lower wholesale boxed beef prices in 2004, resulting in estimated losses ranging from $3.2 to $4.7 billion. In 2004, losses from the loss of beef and by-product exports amounted to $3.2 to $4.7 billion."
