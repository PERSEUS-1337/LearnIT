    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, job numbers fell the following month. Both private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs rising to 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been most affected by job losses, while some service-providing industries like education and health services have continued to add workers. The financial activities industry also experienced job losses before the economic downturn. The housing market downturn has negatively affected financial activities, including brokerage firms and investors. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, history shows that sustained job growth may not be immediate. Job growth following past recessions varied, with some recoveries seeing steady growth within three to five months, while others took longer, such as 12 months after the 1990-1991 recession and 22 months after the 2001 recession. Congressional actions to create jobs in response to recessions have included raising demand for goods and services. Congress has acted to create jobs by increasing federal spending, often directing funds to infrastructure projects. Public works historically included heavy construction activities but now also encompasses green economic activities. Green jobs are related to industries using renewable resources or producing energy-efficient goods and services. The focus is on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending. The section discusses how job creation estimates are developed and two models for calculating jobs nationwide and by state in the construction industry. It also highlights challenges in estimating jobs from green economic activities. Policymakers are interested in comparing stimulus options and shifting expenditures to different budget categories to create jobs. An input-output (I-O) model is often used to estimate the number of jobs created by economic activities. It shows the interrelationships between industries and how the dollar value of sales is distributed. For example, it can show how roof trusses and bricks produced by different industries are used in construction. Employment requirements are then derived from productivity estimates for each industry. The employment requirements associated with a specific type of final demand are determined by the direct and indirect jobs supported by economic activity. It is expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars spent and is shown in an employment requirements table, similar to an I-O table, displaying the jobs supported by different industries for each billion dollars spent. This allows for estimating the impact of expenditures on employment. An employment requirements table allows for estimating the impact of expenditures on different industries and job creation. I-O models freeze technology and productivity, leading to potential differences in job creation over time. Estimates are based on billion-dollar expenditures, but actual job creation may vary due to resource constraints. During economic downturns, these constraints are less significant. The impact of expenditures on job creation may be overstated in economic downturns due to imported inputs and the lack of differentiation between full-time and part-time jobs in I-O tables. A comprehensive estimate of job creation includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs throughout the economy. The multiplier effect of highway construction programs on job creation is uncertain, as it depends on how much of the additional money earned by workers is spent versus saved. Estimates vary widely, with the Federal Highway Administration estimating that $1 billion in federal-aid highway expenditures supported 47,575 jobs. However, the actual number of jobs created also depends on economic conditions. The FHWA estimates that $1 billion in federal funds for highway construction could support 27,822 jobs, with jobs decreasing over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. This breakdown includes 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. The FHWA estimates that $1 billion in federal funds for highway construction could support 27,822 jobs, with jobs decreasing over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. This includes construction-oriented jobs, jobs in supporting industries, and induced jobs, accounting for one-half of the total estimate. The job estimate utilizes the national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs, but specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported. Highway funds spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project outlaying in the first year. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics makes available employment requirements tables for assessing the impact on employment of different policies or actions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. These tables are updated to reflect current production and distribution technologies and labor productivity. The tables provide information for the construction industry as a whole, including subdivisions such as construction of buildings and heavy and civil construction. The construction industry is divided into major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the construction industry itself. Discrepancies in job figures for construction expenditures may be due to differences in industry definition, data sources, and time period. BLS employment requirements do not include other types of construction like public school construction. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries. The number of jobs supported by $1 billion in construction spending varies by state due to differences in industry mix. Each state's capacity to supply intermediate goods for construction affects job creation estimates. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not currently identify green industries separately, making it challenging to estimate the number of jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are not uniquely recognized in the NAICS, hindering accurate data collection for these industries. The conventional I-O model is not suitable for estimating jobs in green activities like retrofitting. NAICS lacks a unique category for retrofitting, making conventional models problematic. One study addressed this issue by creating synthetic industries to account for green sectors not recognized in input-output tables. The researchers combined various industries to estimate green jobs, assigning weights based on their contributions. Green job projections vary due to different assumptions and timeframes, with some reports including induced employment. State-specific analyses may not be applicable elsewhere due to differing industry mixes. The underlying assumptions and methodologies of job creation estimates vary. The assumptions and methodologies underlying job creation estimates for green economy strategies are often unclear, making review difficult. Studies were not originally intended to quickly stabilize or increase jobs during a recession. A 2008 report commissioned by the Center for American Progress proposed a program to create almost 2 million jobs in a low-carbon economy. A study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst estimates that a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" could create or preserve almost 2 million jobs. The program would involve federal spending on activities like public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for building retrofits. The Apollo Alliance proposed a 10-year $500 billion program to create 5 million green-collar jobs. The new initiative, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), involves federal spending of about $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. The allocation includes funds for improving the electric grid, repairing roads and bridges, and replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles. Congress emphasized the need for tracking job creation resulting from the legislation in Title XV of the bill. Title XV of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires entities receiving ARRA appropriations to report estimates of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. Recipients made their first submission in October 2009, with federal agencies required to post reports online. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance for job estimates, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) commented on the job estimates. As of September 30, 2009, 633,342 jobs were saved or retained. OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved so that recipients no longer have to make a subjective judgment on whether a given job would have existed were it not for the Recovery Act. Recipients reported that 608,311 jobs were funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009, and another 682,370 jobs were created or saved at ARRA recipients in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) was tasked with submitting quarterly reports on the effect of ARRA provisions on employment and other economic indicators. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) was mandated to report on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and other economic indicators. The first quarterly report found that ARRA may have added around one million jobs in August 2009. CBO also estimated the impact of ARRA on employment and economic output, providing a broader estimate beyond direct government purchases. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases resulted in 600,000 to 1.6 million additional jobs by September 2009. The CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million jobs in August 2009 aligns with CBO's range. Subsequent reports showed potential job increases of 1.7-1.9 million by December 2009, 2.2-2.8 million by March 2010. The CEA's report on ARRA's impact in the first quarter of 2010 suggests that the policies may have increased employment by 1.2-2.8 million. In the second quarter, ARRA could have added between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs. Public investment outlays under ARRA, including clean energy, education, transportation, healthcare, and construction, may have boosted total employment by over 627,000 jobs in Q1 and over 800,000 jobs in Q2 of 2010."
