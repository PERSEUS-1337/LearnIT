    "content": "The Act titled \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" is aimed at addressing purposes related to hearing loss detection and intervention. The Act aims to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks for hearing loss in babies, ensuring screening before leaving hospitals, within 3 months for non-hospital births, timely diagnostic testing, and linkage to intervention services. Public policy should be research-based. Intervention for infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing should be research-based and involve consultation with relevant sectors. Statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks are essential for infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, developing universal newborn hearing detection programs, and ensuring effective screening and referral services. Data collected will be used for research and policy development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, identifying causes of hearing loss, and assessing program effectiveness. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss, including clinical trials and intervention efficacy studies. Promoting data sharing with State-based monitoring programs to identify unknown causes of hearing loss is also emphasized. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with various agencies, organizations, and professionals to develop policies. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health will collaborate on recommendations for policy development at Federal and State levels, including early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will assist States in establishing early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks and developing a data collection system. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nFor the purpose of carrying out early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks, $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, $5,000,000 is authorized for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. For National Institutes of Health, $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2001 through 2003."
