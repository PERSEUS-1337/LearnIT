    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009\". It includes provisions for affordable refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are required to carry out a program to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages on single-family housing. Lenders must offer mortgages for purchase, and if they meet the requirements for qualified mortgages, the enterprises will commit to purchase them. The Director will establish policies and procedures for this program. The enterprise must establish a procedure for approving lenders to receive commitments in advance for purchasing qualified mortgages. A qualified mortgage can be a refinancing mortgage or a new mortgage, meeting specific requirements such as being on single-family housing and the mortgagor occupying the property as their principal residence. The refinancing mortgage must be used to pay off an existing first mortgage on the same property originated before January 1, 2008. The new mortgage must have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0% annually and a term of 30 to 40 years. The qualified new mortgage must meet underwriting standards set by the Director and have all prepayment penalties waived. It must also be used to purchase the property and have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0% annually. New mortgages originated after the enactment of this Act must adhere to underwriting standards. Exceptions to these standards, such as downpayment and credit rating, may be established to allow for the purchase and securitization of qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. Each enterprise must set aside qualified mortgages for securitization and issue securities based on them, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury. Securities can be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates. Securities issued under this subsection by enterprises must have approved maturities, interest rates, and adequate mortgages to ensure timely payments. These securities are considered exempt and not guaranteed by the United States. Required disclosure must be included in all issued securities. The Federal Reserve will establish a credit facility to provide credit to enterprises at interest rates comparable to Treasury securities. The requirement for enterprises to purchase mortgages will not apply to mortgages offered after December 31, 2010. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines the Director as the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Enterprise as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Secretary as the Secretary of the Treasury."
