    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\". Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. The impact of these procedures on public health and safety, as well as interstate commerce, is significant. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that only properly educated and credentialed personnel perform these procedures. Additionally, there is a need for a steady supply of well-educated individuals and state-administered accreditation and certification programs to uphold public health and safety standards. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy must ensure personnel demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience. Both State and Federal Governments are responsible for protecting public health and safety in these procedures, which impact interstate commerce. Congress previously enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 to address these concerns. The Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 established Federal standards for accreditation of education programs and certification for individuals performing medical imaging and radiation therapy. Twenty-two years later, some States do not require licensure for these professionals, while others have varying levels of licensing and regulation for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, and medical physicists. Medical dosimetrists are not regulated or licensed in any State. The Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 established Federal standards for accreditation of education programs and certification for individuals performing medical imaging and radiation therapy. Currently, no States regulate or license medical dosimetrists. The purposes of this Act are to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure or certification for individuals involved in patient dose planning and verification for medical imaging and radiation therapy, as well as to ensure the safety and accuracy of these treatments. SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, accreditation, and other requirements. Exemptions are provided for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary and meet additional requirements before performing imaging or therapy. Private bodies will be certified by the Secretary. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations. Minimum standards for certification will be established, including recordkeeping, curriculum approval, and fee charging. Approved bodies must provide assurances of compliance with these standards. The Secretary certifies approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations. Approved bodies must comply with standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide required information. The Secretary can withdraw certification if standards are not met, but accreditation or examination completion remains valid for a reasonable period. The Secretary evaluates approved bodies periodically and includes the results in a report to specific committees. Regulations for program delivery and payment must be established within 18 months of the section's enactment. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 18 months to ensure that all medical imaging and radiation therapy programs under their authority meet established standards. Alternative standards may be developed for rural areas to guarantee access to quality care. In this section, regulations will be implemented by the Secretary to ensure that medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet standards. Definitions for terms like 'approved body', 'medical imaging', and 'perform' are provided. The regulations implemented by the Secretary ensure that medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet standards. The term 'plan' refers to preparing for a procedure by evaluating site-specific information for the patient. Radiation therapy is defined as any procedure intended for disease treatment through radiation emission."
