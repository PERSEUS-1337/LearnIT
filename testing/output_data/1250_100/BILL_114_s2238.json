    "content": "The \"Keep It in the Ground Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that global temperatures have increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2014, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels. Emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise, leading to a warming trend with significant impacts on the economy and environment. To avoid exceeding a 2 degrees Celsius increase, 80 percent of carbon from fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. The policy of the United States is to manage Federal land and waters to avoid the dangerous impacts of climate change and promote a transition to clean energy by keeping fossil fuels in the ground. This includes not issuing new leases or renewing nonproducing leases for coal, oil, or natural gas on Federal land or waters. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nExtend - extending a lease under the Mineral Leasing Act beyond the existing term.\nNonproducing lease - a lease where no fossil fuel has been extracted for commercial use.\nReinstate - reinstating a lease after a violation that led to suspension or cancellation.\nRenew - renewing a lease for a term not longer than the maximum renewal term.\nSecretary - the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 4. STOPPING NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE PACIFIC, ATLANTIC, AND ARCTIC OCEANS. Prohibition on new oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf is defined as extending a lease beyond its existing term, including reinstating a lease after a violation. The Secretary of the Interior is prohibited from issuing new leases or renewing nonproducing leases for oil and gas exploration in specific areas, including the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. Existing leases may be canceled within 60 days of enactment. The Secretary must cancel any lease issued under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in the Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, or Chukchi Sea within 60 days of enactment. SEC. 5 of the Act prohibits new leases for coal, oil, tar sands, fracked gas, and oil shale on federal land. SEC. 6 provides exceptions. The Secretary may exempt provisions of the Act for a lease in case of imminent national security threat, with the exemption lasting as long as the threat persists. Nonproducing leases can be renewed if signed before the Act's enactment and if enforcing the Act may lead to a court case. The Act allows for renewal or extension of nonproducing leases if signed before enactment, but may result in a court ruling of material breach. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its amendments is deemed invalid, the rest of the Act and amendments, as well as their application, will not be affected."
