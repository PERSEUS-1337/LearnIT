    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Every Child Deserves a Family Act.\" Congressional findings and purposes are also included. Congress finds a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster children in the child welfare system, leading to thousands of foster children without permanent homes. To address this, child welfare agencies should eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status in adoption and foster care procedures. Over 101,000 children in the US foster care system are legally free for adoption, with 50,608 children adopted in 2013 and 23,090 youth aging out of the system, facing risks of poverty, homelessness, and incarceration. Increasing adoption rates is crucial. Experts agree that LGBTQ youth in foster care face discrimination, harassment, and violence due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Many end up homeless, with 60% of them having been in foster care before. Additionally, around 19% of same-sex couple households have children under 18. The Williams Institute estimates that 3 million LGBTQ individuals have had a child, and up to 6 million American adults and children are LGBTQ. Increasing adoption rates can lead to significant national cost savings and provide permanency for foster youth. As of 2013, same-sex couples are raising 1.4 percent of adopted children with 2 parents and fostering 1.7 percent of foster children living with 2 parents. An additional 2,000,000 gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are interested in adoption. Studies show that children with same-sex parents have similar advantages and expectations for health, social, and psychological development as children with heterosexual parents. An Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute study found that 1/3 of child welfare agencies in the United States reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants, reducing the number of qualified adoptive and foster parents overall. More than 3,400 children are in foster placements with same-sex couples, and another 22,000 children are raised by same-sex adoptive couples. Recognition of joint adoption for same-sex couples provides children with the same rights and security as children of heterosexual parents, including access to health benefits, survivor's benefits, Social Security, and child support entitlements. It also establishes permanency for parents and child. Professional organizations in the fields of medicine support this practice. Professional organizations in various fields support qualified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and adopt children, citing scientific research that shows sexual orientation does not affect parental success. Discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in foster care and adoption is not in the best interests of children. The purpose of the Act is to decrease waiting times for children to find loving families and prevent discrimination in placements based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. \"Every child deserves a family.\" An entity receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care placements cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of the person or child involved. They also cannot delay placements or require additional screenings based on these factors. The section prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in adoption or foster care placements. It defines placement decisions and allows for legal action in case of violations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide guidance for compliance within six months of the Act's enactment. Technical assistance is also provided to ensure understanding and compliance with the law. To ensure compliance with the Act, the Secretary will provide technical assistance to covered entities, including identifying and addressing inconsistencies in laws, casework practices, and procedures. Additionally, guidance will be given for expanding recruitment efforts to consider all interested and qualified prospective adoptive and foster parents, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. Cultural competency training will also be provided. Entities involved in adoption and foster care placements must comply with the Act within 6 months of guidance publication or 1 year of enactment. States can request deadline extensions for statutory law amendments. The Act requires compliance within 6 months of guidance publication or 1 year of enactment. The Secretary can withhold funds from non-compliant states. A GAO study will assess state compliance with the Act after 5 years. The Act mandates the removal of barriers based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status for adoption and foster care placements. It also eliminates additional screenings or processes based on these factors. A report to Congress is required within 1 year of completing a study on compliance. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress containing the results of the study required by paragraph (1)."
