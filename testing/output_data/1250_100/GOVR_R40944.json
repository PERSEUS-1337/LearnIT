    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an original work of authorship. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office offers advantages, such as the ability to file infringement suits and receive statutory damages. In the case of New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for licensing their work to electronic databases without permission. The Supreme Court ruled in Tasini v. New York Times that publishers cannot electronically reproduce freelance works without specific authorization, leading to the removal of many works from databases. This decision sparked class action lawsuits, including Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick, where freelance authors sought compensation for unauthorized electronic reproduction of their works. In Elsevier v. Muchnick, a class action lawsuit was filed by freelance authors and trade groups against publishers for reproducing their works in electronic databases without consent or compensation, alleging copyright infringement. Litigation required court certification of the class, and settlement proposals needed court approval with the ability for class members to object, subject to court permission for withdrawal of objections. In a class action suit against publishers and electronic database services for copyright infringement, a settlement was reached after three years of negotiations. The agreement categorized claims into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Each category had a specific damages formula, with claimants receiving either a flat fee or a percentage of the original work's price. The settlement agreement in a class action suit against publishers and electronic database services categorized claims into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. The \"C-reduction\" feature reduced payments to Category C claimants if total claims exceeded $18 million. Objectors raised concerns about the fairness of the settlement, arguing that Category C claimants were inadequately represented. The district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005 for a class action suit involving Category C claimants with unregistered copyrights. Objectors appealed, questioning the settlement's fairness and plaintiffs' representation. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns regarding claims related to unregistered copyrights, leading both parties to argue that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional. The district court's jurisdiction over copyright claims is questioned, with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stating that claims must arise from registered copyrights only, as per \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act. This conflicts with the general and specific grants of jurisdiction provided by Title 28 of the U.S. Code. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that copyright registration prior to an infringement suit is jurisdictional, preventing the district court from certifying a class or approving a settlement due to many unregistered copyrights. Judge Walker dissented, suggesting a re-evaluation of the copyright registration requirement as an \"enforcement mechanism\" rather than a \"rights-creating statute.\" The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. The statute requires copyright registration before initiating a civil action, but exceptions exist if registration is refused. The U.S. Supreme Court reviewed whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) limits federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. Petitioners argued that the registration requirement is not jurisdictional and should not prevent parties from settling claims. The U.S. Supreme Court reviewed whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) limits federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. Respondents argued that \u00a7411(a) is not a bar to jurisdiction but a claim-processing rule that could be enforced or waived by defendants. They also argued for supplemental jurisdiction based on claims of authors with unregistered copyrights arising from the same case as authors with registered copyrights. The United States supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment, agreeing that \u00a7411(a) does not limit federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction. The U.S. argued that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite to a lawsuit, not a limit on federal courts' jurisdiction. They stated that non-compliance with the registration requirement did not warrant vacating the district court's judgment. Both petitioners and respondents wanted the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit's ruling, leading to the appointment of Professor Deborah Jones Merritt as amicus curiae in support of the Second Circuit's judgment. Professor Merritt emphasized that \u00a7411(a) clearly restricts federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction. Professor Merritt argued that \u00a7411(a) serves vital public purposes and should not be waived by parties in settlement agreements. She also stated that the jurisdictional defect in the case was not cured by a special rule for settlement or the supplemental jurisdiction act. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's judgment with an amicus brief. The CCIA supported the Second Circuit's judgment in Reed Elsevier, arguing that the registration requirement is necessary for Internet service providers to reduce exposure to copyright infringement claims. They urged the Supreme Court to dismiss the petitioners' writ on the grounds that there was no case or controversy and no circuit split. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals on March 2, 2010. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on March 2, 2010. The Court ruled that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not a jurisdictional condition for filing a claim for infringement. This allowed the district court to certify the class and approve the settlement between freelance authors, publishers, and electronic databases. The Supreme Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the court's power to adjudicate a case, not the rights or obligations of parties. The Supreme Court clarified that statutory limitations on coverage should be treated as nonjurisdictional unless clearly stated otherwise. In Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., the Court held that the employee numerosity requirement in Title VII was a substantive element of the claim, not affecting federal court jurisdiction. The numerosity requirement in Title VII claims is not clearly stated as jurisdictional, as seen in the Reed Elsevier Court case. The Court rejected the argument that the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute indicated jurisdictional intent, emphasizing that it was Congress' intent to grant federal courts authority to determine registrability issues. The employee numerosity requirement is separate from Title VII's jurisdiction-granting section and is located in Title 17 of the U.S. Code. The Court noted that \u00a7411(a) in Title 17 of the U.S. Code contains exceptions allowing courts to adjudicate infringement claims for unregistered works in certain circumstances, and argued against ascribing jurisdictional significance to registration requirements. The Reed Elsevier Court distinguished its 2007 decision in Bowles v. Russell, noting that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) of Title 17 is not jurisdictional but a statutory prerequisite for initiating a lawsuit. The Court emphasized that context and historical interpretation are relevant in determining whether a requirement is jurisdictional. The Court rejected Professor Merritt's argument that \u00a7411(a) should be construed as jurisdictional to promote policy goals and congressional objectives underlying copyright registration. The Court also declined to affirm on estoppel grounds the appellate court's judgment. The parties' assertion that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional in defending the settlement agreement followed existing precedent in the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit rejected the petitioners' argument that \u00a7411(a) did not restrict the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that its adoption of the petitioners' arguments would create inconsistent court determinations. They did not express an opinion on the fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the settlement, leaving it to the court of appeals to consider. The Court also declined to decide if \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition to copyright infringement claims, leaving this question open for lower courts to consider. Justice Ginsburg agreed with the Court's judgment on \u00a7411(a) but noted a tension between precedents and offered her interpretation. Justice Ginsburg reconciled the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents by suggesting that Bowles relied on longstanding Supreme Court decisions left undisturbed by Congress. She noted that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional based on Arbaugh's bright line rule, despite over 200 opinions characterizing it as jurisdictional. Justice Ginsburg argued that Bowles does not apply to the Copyright Act's registration requirement, as the opinions on this matter are from lower courts and not the Supreme Court. The Reed Elsevier case is now remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider the settlement's merits and objections. If the appellate court upholds the settlement approval, freelance authors will receive compensation and electronic databases can restore publications. Judge Walker's dissent raised concerns about the settlement's damages formula and lack of representation for certain class members. The Supreme Court's opinion in Reed Elsevier has implications for copyright holders in future infringement cases, allowing participation in settlements and class action lawsuits for both registered and unregistered works. District courts may dismiss claims involving unregistered works, but federal courts can approve settlements involving both types of works. This case clarifies subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright law litigation. Reed Elsevier clarifies subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts in copyright law cases, reaffirming the clear statement rule from Arbaugh and limiting Bowles to historically jurisdictional situations."
