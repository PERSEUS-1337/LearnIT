    "content": "The Act titled \"Scenic Columbia Gorge Restoration Act of 2017\" allows for expedited recovery activities in response to catastrophic events in national scenic areas. The Act defines terms related to catastrophic events, response activities, and National Scenic Areas. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the Forest Service, must propose response activities within 30 days of a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area. Public input and objection processes are required before implementing the response activity, with an expedited environmental assessment. In response to a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area, the Secretary of Agriculture must propose response activities within 30 days. An environmental assessment for a National Scenic Area response activity must be completed within 60 days. A categorical exclusion is available for response activities not exceeding 10,000 acres within the area. Consultation under the Endangered Species Act is not required if a response activity is not likely to harm listed species or critical habitat. Expedited consultation must be completed within 90 days for activities that may affect endangered species. Response activities that are initiated and concluded within the 90-day period specified are deemed not to violate the Endangered Species Act. No court orders can be issued to restrain response activities, and funding from a special fund can be used for these activities, including reforestation on National Scenic Area lands. The Secretary must reforest at least 75% of National Scenic Area lands impacted by a catastrophic event within two years of the event."
