    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\". Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans face restrictions in accessing disability compensation and struggle to find employment due to the label on their discharge papers. The Department of Defense had low compliance rates in separating members based on these disorders. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is proposed to review such separations. A review is needed to ensure veterans separated based on personality or adjustment disorders can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. Department of Defense will review military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. Adequate administrative and behavioral health support staff will be provided for each board. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review for members and former members of the armed forces separated due to mental conditions. Covered individuals will be notified of their right to a review, with compliance monitored by the Secretary of Defense. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will review the separation of covered individuals from the armed forces, ensuring compliance with notification requirements and providing the right to obtain legal counsel. The review will consider the findings of the Department of Defense psychologist or psychiatrist, the decisions of the separation authority, and the correct procedures followed. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review evaluates separations from the military to ensure compliance with legal procedures, including obtaining consent for reviews. It considers evidence from the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and private mental health records. After completing the review, the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review must provide a statement of reasons to the claimant. The covered individual can request reconsideration with new evidence. The board can recommend no negative recharacterization, retirement for disability, or separation for disability with entitlement to the Secretary of the military department concerned. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend separation for disability with severance pay, separation upon expiration of service term, or separation for Government convenience. If no retirement recommendation is made, a brief statement of reasons must be provided. Military records of a covered individual will be corrected based on the board's recommendation. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend separation for disability with severance pay, expiration of service term, or Government convenience. Military records of a covered individual will be corrected based on the board's recommendation, with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense must establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of this Act's enactment, as required by section 1554b of title 10, United States Code. Regulations for this section must also be prescribed within the same timeframe."
