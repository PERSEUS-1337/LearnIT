    "content": "The Construction Subcontractors Payment Protection Enhancement Act of 1998 requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to establish government-wide policies ensuring timely payment of contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. This includes implementing statutes like the Prompt Payment Act, the Miller Act, and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 through the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Construction Subcontractors Payment Protection Enhancement Act of 1998 mandates timely payment policies for contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. Proposed revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation must be published within 120 days of enactment, with final regulations within 180 days. Amendments to the Miller Act are also included. The Miller Act is amended to improve payment bond protection by equalizing the amount of the payment bond to the performance bond. Additionally, payment bond protection is extended to all subcontractors and suppliers, ensuring timely payment for progress payments and labor/material supplied. The Miller Act is amended to enhance payment bond protection by requiring written waivers, modernizing service of payment bond claims, and preserving payment bond rights for individuals. The Miller Act is amended to streamline payment bond protection by allowing suits to proceed even if filed before 90 days after the last labor or material provision, and discouraging frivolous litigation by allowing courts to award costs and fees to the prevailing party. The Miller Act is amended to allow courts to award court costs, attorneys' fees, and interest if a suit is deemed frivolous or groundless. Interest awarded shall be calculated from the claim date to payment date using applicable interest rates. Contracting officers are responsible for obtaining payment bonds from contractors. The Miller Act is amended to allow courts to award court costs, attorneys' fees, and interest for frivolous suits. Contracting officers must obtain and ensure the payment bond remains in effect during the contract administration. If the bond is not in effect due to officer negligence, the court may authorize a suit against the United States."
