FEC decision, corporate political spending has significantly increased, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest when nominees or appointees have ties to political entities. Contributions to organizations under sections 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) of the IRS code may pose risks of actual or perceived conflicts of interest. Current financial disclosure requirements do not mandate reporting donations to political action committees or entities under sections 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, allowing for anonymous political spending. To address conflicts of interest, public disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics is recommended for negotiation of ethics agreements. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
