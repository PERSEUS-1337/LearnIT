    "content": "The \"Rural Telemedicine Act of 1995\" is established to create a project for rural telemedicine. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish up to 10 pilot projects to study the use of rural health care provider telemedicine networks for physician consultative services under Medicare in rural areas. A rural health care provider telemedicine network is defined as a network of providers serving physicians, clinics, and nontertiary care providers in rural areas with agreements for patient referral, joint communications, and transportation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish pilot projects to study rural health care provider telemedicine networks for physician consultative services under Medicare in rural areas. The network must operate in a rural area designated as a health professional shortage area or an underserved rural area. SEC. 3. Medicare payment for participants. Under this Act, the Secretary will make payments from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for physicians' services in rural areas, even if the provider is not physically present. The methodology for determining payments will consider available funds and include payment for signal transmission facilities. Payments may also be made for nonphysician providers. Payments may be made for any service by nonphysician providers under subsection (a) without the requirement of being a physician. SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY OF NETWORKS. A network can participate in the pilot project if it meets certain requirements set by the Secretary. The term \"rural area\" is defined in the Social Security Act. SEC. 5. CRITERIA FOR SELECTING PARTICIPANTS. In selecting networks for pilot projects, priority will be given to those that facilitate consultations between patients and specialists through detailed data transmission. Existing networks can also participate in the project. The Secretary must submit an interim report to Congress within 24 months of making payments for pilot project services, detailing participating projects and networks. A final report is due within 1 year of project termination, analyzing cost-effectiveness, impact on patient care quality, and providing recommendations for changes in the Medicare program related to telemedicine. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress on telemedicine pilot projects, including cost estimates for any changes. Authorization of appropriations from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for a total of $51,000,000 for a demonstration project under this Act, with up to $1,000,000 allocated for administrative purposes."
