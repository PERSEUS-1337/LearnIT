    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses and continued to grow for consumers until 2005 when filings surpassed 2 million. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 caused a rush of filings before its implementation. Filings dropped sharply in 2006 due to accelerated filings, but rose steadily until 2010. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with credit card debt and auto/college loans being significant components. Household debt consists of credit card debt and non-revolving debt like auto and college loans. Mortgage debt is secured by real estate, with home equity lending as a subcategory. Debt service burden has fluctuated between 10.80% to 13.93%, with a gradual increase since the 1980s. Despite a decline in debt service ratio since 2007, bankruptcy rates have not significantly reduced. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have decreased to historic lows since the 1950s, leading to a rise in the ratio of debt to income. This increase in debt burden suggests potential future issues with bankruptcy filings if interest rates suddenly rise. Household debt has increased since 1990, with some families struggling to repay debt. The data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances from 1995 to 2007 shows that lower-income families are more likely to file for bankruptcy due to high levels of debt. Despite no significant increase in overall distress levels from 1998 to 2007, there was a notable rise in distress among higher-income families, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The reasons for families taking on high debt levels and ending up in bankruptcy court vary, including factors like health issues, lack of insurance, divorce, and state regulations. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, while opponents blamed credit card issuers for financial distress leading to bankruptcy filings. The U.S. economy entered a recession in December 2007, causing a decline in household debt levels until a slight rise in 2011. Factors contributing to the fall in debt balances include households paying down debt and mortgage debt accounting for most of the drop. The fall in debt balances is attributed to households paying down debt, borrowing less, and increased debt write-offs by lenders. Some lenders have tightened credit standards, leading to a decrease in mortgage balances due to modifications and foreclosures. The causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction."
