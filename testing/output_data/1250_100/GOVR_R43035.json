    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and State Department on U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has made adjustments using executive authority, but may need congressional action for further changes. Congress may consider reassessing its role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration introduced a new approach to U.S. relations with Burma in 2009, maintaining existing sanctions while adding new elements. This included engaging in direct dialogue with Burma's ruling military junta on promoting democracy and human rights, cooperating on international security issues, and pressing for the release of political prisoners and an end to human rights violations. The Obama Administration introduced a new approach to U.S. relations with Burma in 2009, maintaining existing sanctions while adding new elements. This included engaging in direct dialogue with Burma's ruling military junta on promoting democracy and human rights, cooperating on international security issues, and pressing for the release of political prisoners and an end to human rights violations. The new U.S. policy towards Burma called for an end to conflicts with ethnic minorities, human rights violations, and initiated a political dialogue with opposition leaders. The SPDC held parliamentary elections in November 2010, releasing opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest shortly after. The SPDC transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in March 2011. Since 2008, Burma's quasi-civilian government, led by President Thein Sein, has implemented political and economic reforms, including releasing political prisoners and amending oppressive laws. In 2012, parliamentary by-elections saw Aung San Suu Kyi's party win a majority of seats. The Obama Administration responded by easing sanctions and increasing high-level meetings with the Burmese government. The US government has eased many sanctions on Burma, appointing the first US ambassador in 20 years and increasing assistance. Despite reforms, the political and economic situation in Burma remains fragile. Fighting continues between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias. Fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias persists in various parts of the country, with serious human rights violations reported in Kachin State. Ethnic tensions have been exposed by rioting in Rakhine State. Despite some improvements in civil liberties laws, oppressive laws remain in place. The NLD participated in the 2012 by-elections, but other political parties face registration challenges. Over 200 political prisoners are still held in Burma's prisons. The 113th Congress may address issues related to Burma's political and economic development and President Thein Sein's commitment to democracy and human rights. The current chunk discusses various questions regarding U.S. policy towards Burma, including the government's commitment to democracy and human rights, the role of ethnic minorities, the easing of sanctions, enforcement of sanctions, aid assistance, and alignment with the Obama Administration's objectives in Southeast Asia. The Obama Administration's Burma policy, influenced by a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs, initially focused on engaging with Burma's military regime while maintaining sanctions. Over time, there was skepticism towards the Union Government's leadership and reform prospects, leading to an evolving approach by the administration. The Obama Administration's Burma policy evolved from engaging with the military regime to focusing on promoting progressive forces within President Thein Sein's government. This shift led to closer ties between the US and the Burmese government, possibly at the expense of relations with opposition parties and ethnic groups. President Obama emphasized a partnership with Thein Sein's government, isolating anti-reform individuals and organizations. The Obama Administration shifted its Burma policy towards partnering with President Thein Sein's government, moving away from traditional opposition parties and ethnic organizations. This change included a shift from a gradual relaxation of sanctions to promoting further reforms in Burma. Some experts and interest groups debate whether the administration has moved too quickly in rewarding modest progress towards U.S. goals in Burma. The Obama Administration made modest progress towards U.S. goals in Burma, holding discussions with SPDC officials and attending ASEAN-U.S. leaders meeting. Existing U.S. sanctions on Burma would remain until concrete reform progress is seen, with the possibility of implementing additional sanctions if needed. The administration reserved the right to relax or remove sanctions if Burma meets specified criteria in U.S. law. In 2010, the Obama Administration commented on the tense political situation in Burma, where the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotted the November elections due to unfair election laws. The SPDC transformed the USDA into a political party, the USDP, and announced the transformation of ethnic militias into Border Guard Forces under Burmese military command. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army's refusal to join the Border Guard Force led to a military offensive, causing over 30,000 refugees to flee to China. Tensions escalated with the Shan State Army-North and other ethnic militias, while concerns about Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea also arose in 2010. The special report \"Burma's Nuclear Ambitions\" claimed the SPDC had an active nuclear weapons program with support from North Korea. Despite doubts about Burma's technical ability, the arms trade violation under U.N. Resolution 1874 was a concern for the Obama Administration. After the 2010 elections, President Obama criticized the flawed process and continued detention of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The unfair electoral laws and partisan Election Commission in Burma silenced pro-democracy parties, including the National League for Democracy. The regime denied registration of ethnic parties, canceled elections in ethnic areas, and obstructed opposition candidates. The United States will maintain pressure on Burma's authorities to release political prisoners, uphold human rights, and engage in dialogue with pro-democracy groups. Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner expressed concerns about the situation in Burma following the transfer of power in 2011. The United States continues to express concerns about the flawed electoral process in Burma, urging authorities to release political prisoners and engage in dialogue with democratic and ethnic opposition parties. Derek Mitchell was confirmed as the first Special Representative for Burma in 2011. The Special Representative for Burma position was created in 2008 and remained unfilled for over three years until Derek Mitchell was confirmed in 2011. The role involves coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma, consulting with foreign governments, and Congress. The new Burmese government showed both positive and negative developments, such as releasing political prisoners and making overtures for political reconciliation, but also being involved in a weapons technology interception incident with a Navy destroyer. The Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to fighting spreading in Burma. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the new Burmese government's progress. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the new Burmese government's progress, citing concerns about ongoing human rights abuses, conflicts with ethnic militias, and relations with North Korea. Ambassador Mitchell visited Burma to discuss these issues with President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi, and NLD leaders, as well as ethnic group representatives. President Thein Sein's announcement of willingness to negotiate ceasefire agreements was seen as a potential step forward. President Thein Sein's visit and the U.S. Ambassador's involvement set the stage for future developments in bilateral relations. The second large-scale prisoner pardon released 6,359 individuals, including 241 political prisoners. Discussions on political reform, ethnic militia conflicts, ceasefire talks, and human rights took place during visits by U.S. officials. President Thein Sein signed a law allowing peaceful protests, and President Obama expressed concerns about human rights in Burma. During her visit to Burma in 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced various U.S. development programs, including an English language program, aid for victims of internal conflict, and academic exchange programs. The initiatives were permissible under U.S. sanctions in place at the time. Clinton's visit marked the first by a Secretary of State since 1955, aiming to empower a positive transition in Burma and improve relations between the two countries. In late 2011, the Burmese government implemented political reforms, passed laws protecting civil liberties, and appointed members to the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission. Ceasefire talks with ethnic groups showed progress, despite ongoing fighting in Kachin State. In early 2012, President Thein Sein of Burma made agreements with various ethnic groups and issued prisoner pardons. President Obama waived a law restricting financial aid to Burma, showing support for the country's political reforms. In April 2012, Burma held a by-election with Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD members running as candidates. The election was not considered fully free, fair, transparent, or inclusive, but Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD members won seats. In April 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats in the by-election, with 2 seats going to other parties. The Obama Administration and other countries congratulated Burma on the election participation and removed sanctions. Former Secretary Clinton announced five steps to support reforms in Burma using existing executive authority. The Obama Administration and other countries congratulated Burma on the election participation and removed sanctions. Former Secretary Clinton announced five steps to support reforms in Burma using existing executive authority, including relaxing restrictions on private U.S. organizations providing nonprofit activities and easing trade and investment restrictions. The State Department worked with the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to create an expanded general license for nonprofit projects in Burma. OFAC approved this new general license on April 17, 2012. The officials mentioned agriculture, banking, tourism, and telecommunications as potential areas for easing trade and investment restrictions. They highlighted the need for caution in \"more regressive sectors\" like gems and timber, where projects opposed by local populations have been approved by the Burmese government. The plan involves using existing waiver authorities and not seeking legislative changes. Some steps require presidential waiver authority and certification to Congress. On May 16, 2012, Burma's Foreign Minister visited Washington, DC, where the Obama Administration announced renewing sanctions for one year, nominating an ambassador to Burma, and easing bans on financial services and investment in the country. Former Secretary Clinton detailed steps to allow American investment and export of financial services in Burma. The State Department plans to promote responsible investment and deter abuses in Burma, urging U.S. businesses to set a good example. The easing of sanctions will allow U.S. investors to invest in all sectors and export financial services to Burmese entities not on the SDN list. Criteria for the SDN list will include evaluations of business practices and attitudes towards Burma's reforms. The State Department is working with various stakeholders to develop voluntary corporate governance standards for U.S. companies in Burma. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma, allowing new U.S. investments and export of financial services. Executive Order 13619 expanded sanctions to target individuals threatening Burma's peace or involved in human rights abuses. The Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1997 prohibited financial services export to Burma under E.O. 13310. President Obama delegated authority to waive the investment ban to Secretary Clinton, who then delegated it to Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides. This led to the creation of General License No. 17, allowing new investments in Burma with limitations. U.S. investors must comply with State Department reporting requirements for investments in Burma. The State Department's proposed reporting requirements for investments in Burma include reporting any investment involving the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) within 60 days and all investments over $500,000 annually by April 1. OFAC also issued General License No. 16 allowing the exportation of financial services to Burma with restrictions. General License No. 16 supersedes previous licenses and allows the provision of financial services to Burma without pre-approval from OFAC. Sanctions imposed by President Obama target certain Burmese nationals and entities, prohibiting visas, freezing assets, and banning financial services for those involved in activities threatening Burma's peace or human rights. The political situation in Burma saw both positive and negative developments during the implementation of policy changes in May 2012. Vice President Tin Aung Myint Oo resigned, ceasefire agreements with ethnic groups stalled, and riots broke out between Rohingyas and Rakhines. The Press Scrutiny and Registration Division warned publications about their coverage of the riots. President Thein Sein made progress with political rights and economic reform, pardoning political prisoners and ending pre-publication censorship in Burma in 2012. He also reshuffled his cabinet to consolidate power and purge resistors to reforms. The Union Parliament debated the oversight authority of parliamentary committees to compel ministerial officials to testify. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled against this authority, leading to protests and the resignation of tribunal members. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma in September 2012. In September 2012, President Thein Sein and Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann were removed from the OFAC list of SDNs, lifting financial sanctions. H.R. 6431 was passed to allow the President to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma. Secretary Clinton announced easing restrictions on Burmese imports in response to reform progress. President Thein Sein addressed the U.N. General Assembly in September 2012, highlighting Burma's progress towards political reform. He mentioned the transition to a democratic government, amnesties for prisoners, return of political exiles, successful parliamentary by-elections, abolition of media censorship, freedom of Internet access, establishment of workers' and employers' organizations, and increased political participation. Challenges included ending armed conflicts and addressing communal violence in Rakhine State. Chris Milligan was sworn in as USAID's Mission Director in line with Secretary Clinton's announcement. Chris Milligan was sworn in as USAID's Mission Director to Burma in August 2012, the first in 24 years. The mission focuses on democracy, human rights, governance, peace, food security, and health. President Obama delegated authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma to Secretary Clinton in October 2012. Clinton determined it was in the national interest to support assistance for Burma, effectively waiving the requirement to oppose IFI assistance. The World Bank approved an $80 million grant to Burma for community-driven development in November 2013 with U.S. support. A U.S. delegation led by Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner held a human rights dialogue in Naypyidaw, covering topics like rule of law and military conduct. Burma was invited to attend the Cobra Gold military training exercise in the Asia-Pacific. President Obama announced his intention to visit Burma. The White House announced President Obama's brief stopover in Burma on November 8, 2012, during his trip to Southeast Asia. He would meet with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, and give a speech on political reform. This visit, scheduled for November 19, 2012, would make him the first U.S. President to visit Burma while in office. Special Assistant Samantha Power noted progress in Burma since Secretary Clinton's visit in 2011, with updated sanctions to target those hindering democracy. Senior Director Power recognized the challenges faced by Burma, including ethnic unrest, ongoing conflicts, justice system development, free press cultivation, and civil society formation. National Security Advisor Donilon endorsed President Obama's visit to Burma, supporting ongoing reforms and progress. The State Department waived the ban on imports from Burma, citing national interest. President Obama's visit to Burma included meetings with key leaders, a public speech at the University of Yangon, and discussions on social issues in both countries. The choice of venue was politically significant due to its historical significance in Burma's anti-colonial movement and uprising against military rule. President Obama addressed key issues in the United States and commented on Burma's reform process, emphasizing the importance of free expression, assembly, and press for democracy. He highlighted the U.S. system of governance that limits leaders' power and spoke about the right to live free from fear. Obama expressed confidence in Burma's progress despite challenges, offering U.S. partnership on their journey towards democratic reforms. Meetings with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi were described as frank and constructive. President Obama had a constructive meeting with President Thein Sein, praising Burma's cooperation on non-proliferation issues but noting that political reforms are just the beginning of a long journey. Aung San Suu Kyi also discussed concerns about sustaining democratization momentum and avoiding the illusion of success. During Obama's visit, the Burmese government agreed to comply with U.N. sanctions on North Korea, allow ICRC to resume prisoner visits, review cases of \"prisoners of concern,\" combat human trafficking, address forced labor issues, pursue ceasefire in Kachin State, prevent attacks on civilians in Rakhine State, and hold perpetrators accountable. The weeks after Obama's visit saw political developments. Following President Obama's visit, the Burmese government faced criticism for violent attacks on protesters and military assaults on the Kachin Independence Army, despite promises made. However, steps were taken to protect freedom of assembly and the media. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA escalated after ceasefire talks failed, leading to a major offensive named \"Operation Thunderbolt\" in December 2012. Operation Thunderbolt was a military assault on the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) headquarters in Laiza, involving at least five battalions and aircraft support. The attack drew international criticism for civilian casualties, human rights abuses, and the use of child soldiers. The Burmese government claimed self-defense, while the US urged dialogue to address the conflict. The fragile ceasefire in Kachin State broke down as Tatmadaw forces attacked a KIA base near Laiza. The US Embassy criticized the Burmese Army for continuing the military offensive despite the ceasefire announcement. Burma's Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed the KIA for violating the ceasefire. Negotiations between the Union Government and the KIO/KIA were held in China. Fighting continues in Kachin State despite the talks. The Union Parliament dissolved the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division, improving civil liberties. President Thein Sein abolished a military junta order banning gatherings. The military junta in Burma abolished Order No. 2/88 on September 18, 1988, which banned gatherings of five or more people without official permission. The Ministry of Information introduced a new media legislation to replace the 1962 Printer and Publishers Registration Act, criticized for being more restrictive. Various media groups in Burma condemned the draft bill, citing violations of agreements with the Myanmar Press Council. The draft bill in Burma includes provisions prohibiting publishing articles on ethnic conflicts, criticizing the 2008 constitution, or \"disturbing the rule of law.\" It also establishes a MOI-appointed \"registration official\" with censorship authority. The proposed penalties are three to six months imprisonment and fines up to $12,000, more severe than the 1962 law. OFAC issued general license No. 19 on February 22, 2013, waiving restrictions on financial transactions with four Burmese banks to facilitate U.S. companies and NGOs operating in Burma. OFAC eased economic sanctions on Burma by allowing transactions with four of Burma's larger banks, despite criticism that the banks are owned by individuals with close ties to the military. The Obama Administration's approach towards Burma was discussed at a hearing on human rights in Burma, highlighting the new era of relations between the United States and Burma in response to President Thein Sein's reform agenda. The government, in partnership with Congress, has responded to reforms in Burma to encourage further progress. Assistant Secretary Posner expressed support for Burma's reform process and emphasized the need for the United States to remain committed as long as progress continues. The political situation in Burma is fragile and complex, with important issues regarding future political reforms. General Khin Kyunt announced a roadmap for creating a new government in 2003. The SPDC Prime Minister announced a roadmap for a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma in 2003. The transfer of power to the Union Government in 2011 marked progress towards a modern, developed, and democratic nation. However, the development of democracy in Burma is still a work in progress, with key elements such as civilian control over the military and the Tatmadaw's powers remaining subjects of debate. The future of democracy in Burma hinges on key questions regarding ministerial appointments, the balance of power between branches of government, citizenship conditions, civil liberties, and the role of the military under Commander-in-Chief Vice Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The relationship between the military and Union Government in Burma is opaque, with many cabinet ministers being current or past military officers. The Tatmadaw's limited support for political reform is evident in their actions, such as not following orders to cease military operations. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang's reassignment of military personnel raises questions about his political intentions. The replacement of military-appointed members in the Union Parliament in 2012 raised questions about General Min Aung Hlaing's political intentions. Tensions between the military and the Parliament have been evident, with disputes over the military budget and land seizures. Relations between the two institutions are critical for political reform in Burma. The military in Burma has a pervasive presence in the economy, with regional commanders holding significant economic power. Major corporations in lucrative sectors like mining, oil, and gas are allegedly owned by the military or senior officers. The Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) are key players, with ownership of banks and various companies. These corporate assets generate significant revenues for the military. The Tatmadaw's corporate assets, including UMEHL and Innwa Bank, provide the military with independent revenue and control over the economy. Burma has been in a civil war since 1948 due to ethnic minorities feeling the government did not honor the Panglong Agreement. The military justifies its power as necessary for preserving Burma's unity, as stated in the 2008 Constitution. The government has proposed a peace process to end the civil war and achieve reconciliation. The government has proposed a peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve reconciliation between the Burman majority and ethnic organizations. Steps include negotiating a ceasefire agreement, broader agreements on political and economic development, and amending the 2008 Constitution. A \"peace committee\" has been established for negotiations, with Aung Min as the lead negotiator. Min is the Union Government's lead negotiator in talks with ethnic organizations. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) proposes direct negotiations with the government, followed by a national conference and convention to establish a federal union of Burma. Talks have resulted in preliminary ceasefire agreements with 13 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal talks between the UNFC and the Union Government in Ruili, China in February 2013 led to an agreement for future discussions. However, no progress has been made in completing the second step of the Union Government's peace process. Key issues include disagreements over the powers of the central government versus ethnic States, the need for Tatmadaw's support for national reconciliation, and concerns about Burmese military attacks on ethnic militias despite ceasefire agreements. The Union Government is pushing for national reconciliation within the framework of the 2008 Constitution, aiming to integrate ethnic groups into the current governance system. However, ethnic organizations prefer equal talks and question the legitimacy of the Constitution, drafted without their input to protect the military's power. The future of the Constitution is crucial for any reconciliation proposal in Burma. The Burmese military holds significant power, with concerns over the legitimacy of the 2008 Constitution and subsequent elections. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments, including potentially reducing the Tatmadaw's privileged status in the Union Parliament. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, also seek changes to the Constitution. The NLD and other opposition parties want amendments to the 2008 Constitution, particularly to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to become President after the 2015 elections. While some are willing to follow the constitution's amendment process, many ethnic organizations reject the constitution and prefer direct negotiations for a new one. The amendment process in the constitution may be too difficult to implement due to its stringent requirements. The 2008 Constitution in Myanmar requires a bill to be supported by at least 75% of members and also approved by more than half of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum for certain specified sections. These sections include the government structure, military's role in government, state of emergency conditions, eligibility for President, and amendment requirements. Amendments must also have the support of military appointees in the Union Parliament. The 2008 Constitution in Myanmar requires a bill to be supported by at least 75% of members and also approved by more than half of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum for certain specified sections, including the government structure, military's role in government, state of emergency conditions, eligibility for President, and amendment requirements. The support of military appointees in the Union Parliament is crucial for amendments. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in U.S. policy towards Burma during a potential political transition, with critics divided on the Obama Administration's approach. The 112th Congress passed laws and bills related to Burma, mostly extending sanctions. Hearings were held on U.S. policy towards Burma. New laws extended import bans and pertained to appropriated funds and international financial institutions. The 112th Congress passed laws related to Burma, extending sanctions and prohibiting funds for military training involving child soldiers. Additionally, laws banned international assistance to Burma and instructed against financial support for the country. The 112th Congress passed laws related to Burma, extending sanctions and prohibiting funds for military training involving child soldiers. Additionally, laws banned international assistance to Burma and instructed against financial support for the country. The provision allows assistance for Burma by the institution if the President determines it is in the national interest of the United States. Prior consultation with congressional committees is required, and various bills related to Burma were introduced but did not see further action. H.Con.Res. 135 authorized the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi. The 112th Congress passed laws related to Burma, extending sanctions and prohibiting funds for military training involving child soldiers. Additionally, laws banned international assistance to Burma and instructed against financial support for the country. H.Con.Res. 135 authorized the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi on September 19, 2012. Congressional hearings on Burma during the 112th Congress were divided between the House Committee on Foreign Affairs (HFAC) and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (SFRC). HFAC held hearings on religious freedom, democracy, and human rights in Asia, while SFRC held nomination hearings for Derek J. Mitchell as Special Representative and Ambassador to Burma. The Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs held a hearing on \"U.S. Policy on Burma\" in April 2012. The 113th Congress has various aspects of U.S. policy towards Burma to consider, including oversight of the Obama Administration's approach, legislation adjustments, funding for assistance programs, and congressional oversight of federal laws. Congressional committees have requested testimony from senior officials to examine these matters. The 113th Congress may conduct oversight activities to examine the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, including the reasoning behind the shift in policy. Key aspects to consider are the political changes in Burma, the pace of sanctions easing, and the focus on Burmese officials. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma is under scrutiny by the 113th Congress, focusing on the shift in policy, political changes, sanctions easing, and relations with Burmese officials, Parliament, opposition parties, and ethnic organizations. Questions arise about the legitimacy of the Union Government, the 2008 Constitution, military reform, and establishing closer ties with ethnic groups. The 113th Congress is examining the U.S. policy towards Burma, including issues such as the appointment of a Special Representative, administration of sanctions lists, and submission of required reports to Congress. The 2008 JADE Act mandates the appointment of a Special Representative with ambassador rank for Burma. The Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma in the ASEAN nations cannot hold a separate position within the executive branch. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell was confirmed for the role but stepped down after becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma. W. Patrick Murphy is currently serving as acting Special Representative and Policy Coordinator, exceeding the 210-day limit for temporary appointments. Congress may question the Obama Administration about this. The Obama Administration may be questioned by Congress regarding the nomination of a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. Criticism has been directed at the compilation of lists of Burmese individuals subject to sanctions under various laws and executive orders. The Department of State is responsible for maintaining these lists. The Department of State compiles and maintains a list of Burmese nationals prohibited from receiving entry visas. The 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act freeze assets of certain Burmese persons held by a U.S. person or entering the U.S. Financial services are banned for individuals subject to a visa ban under this law. Critics have accused the State and Treasury Departments of not fully enforcing the visa ban and financial sanctions. The State Department has not publicly disclosed the names on its visa ban list, making compliance with the law difficult to verify. The Treasury Department delegates maintaining the list of Burmese persons subject to financial sanctions to OFAC. The current SDN list does not include dozens of Burmese nationals and companies meeting the criteria. There are concerns about the implementation of visa bans and financial sanctions on Burmese individuals. The implementation of Burmese sanction laws has faced criticism for delays in delivering required reports to Congress. Some reports provided were lacking in detail, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of the sanctions. President Obama has used authority to waive some sanctions, but the underlying authority remains in effect. The current extension of the general import ban in Section 3(a) of the 2003 BFDA ends on July 25, 2013. The State Department determined that a waiver of the import ban was in the national interest. The 113th Congress may consider extending the import ban or altering U.S. policy towards Burma, including imposing or re-imposing sanctions. Congress may also clarify conditions for terminating sanctions and provide guidance on U.S. policy towards Burma. The 113th Congress may consider funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, which include aid for landmine victims, English language training, and democracy programs. Sequestration and budget constraints may affect the amount of funding available for these programs. Sequestration may result in a 5% reduction in annual funding for FY2013, with the Department of State and USAID having the authority to reprogram funds. Uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Burma, but a rough estimate could involve reducing FY2012 estimates by 5%. Once final FY2013 funding legislation is passed, the Department of State can determine country and program allocations to calculate sequestration at the country level. Burma is expected to undergo significant political and economic changes leading up to its 2015 parliamentary elections, with U.S. policy potentially influencing its future path. U.S. policy may influence Burma's future path towards a civilian democratic government based on human rights. The 113th Congress could play an active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma during this critical period. Various reports to Congress are required on topics related to Burma. Reports on Burma are required by the 113th Congress, detailing submission details, frequency, deadline, and delivery method."
