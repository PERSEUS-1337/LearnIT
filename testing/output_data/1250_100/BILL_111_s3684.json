    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". Cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects 1,500,000 people in the US. It is a blood vessel disease with vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Detection is costly, and symptoms include neurological deficits, seizures, and stroke. Limited research means treatment is mainly brain or spinal surgery, with some individuals having no viable treatment options. The prevalence of cavernous angioma is high in New Mexico due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148 highlights the critical need for increased research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence, promoting a team-based approach to translate scientific discoveries into clinical applications. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma, enhance medical care, and develop a cure. The University of New Mexico has the expertise to establish the first centralized center for this purpose. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is proposed to be established at the University of New Mexico. A Cavernous Angioma Care Center of Excellence will be established under the Public Health Service Act at the University of New Mexico. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide support for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will consist of researchers, clinicians, and medical staff with expertise in various specialties. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico will include specialists such as a neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, vascular fellow, postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. The center will be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school and will provide education and training in neurological disease, including research training for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico aims to recruit new researchers and clinicians, provide medical education programs, maintain patient advocacy and outreach programs, and develop electronic health tools for patient care and communication. The CARE Center aims to establish communication tools, network with other research institutions, facilitate collaborations for clinical trials, and form an advisory board with diverse expertise. The CARE Center, headed by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research, aims to provide high-quality medical and surgical care, promote understanding of the condition, facilitate participation in research studies, and serve as a model training facility for similar institutions in the US. Reporting on its activities is required within 2 years. The advisory board of the CARE Center must report biannually to the Secretary on the progress, expenditures, and outcomes of the center. $2,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2011."
