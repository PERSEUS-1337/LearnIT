    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Current federal authorities for fuel reduction are broad but lack sufficient reporting on funding and progress. The current reporting on funding and results for wildfire protection activities is inadequate, hindering the comparison of benefits and costs. Improved reporting, with data disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, could help Congress make better funding decisions. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignitions. All biomass is potential fuel for wildfires, which can range from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires. Wildfires can be surface fires or crown fires, with weather and fuel characteristics determining the type. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent crown fires. Four characteristics of biomass fuels affect wildfire behavior: moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. Moisture content is crucial for flammability, as biomass needs heat to burn. Green foliage moisture fluctuates based on weather, while dead biomass contains less water. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited easily. Wildfires can be surface fires or crown fires, with weather and fuel characteristics determining the type. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent crown fires. Biomass fuels affect wildfire behavior based on moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited easily. Different time lag fuels, such as fine fuels, woody twigs, and larger diameter fuels, contribute to fire intensity and spread. Fine fuels ignite quickly and burn fast, while larger fuels burn more slowly. Fuel characteristics, including mass, burn rate, and time lag fuels, play a significant role in wildfire behavior. Compactness of fuels affects resistance to burning, with highly compact fuel beds being more resistant. Fuel distribution, both horizontally and vertically, also impacts the rate of spread. Larger fuels burn intensely but contribute little to spread, while fine fuels ignite quickly and burn fast. Wind can carry burning fuels aloft as firebrands, starting new fires ahead of the current fire. Fuel distribution, continuity, and compactness impact wildfire behavior. Less compaction allows more air flow, drying out fuels and feeding the fire. Fires need continuous fuels to spread, with factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed influencing the spread. Vertical continuity, like \"fuel ladders,\" can turn a surface fire into a crown fire by providing continuous fuels between the ground and canopy. A crown fire can be initiated and sustained by wind, pre-heating the green foliage, and continuous fuels between the ground and canopy. The fuel load varies widely, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, excluding live crown biomass in commercially valuable trees. The density and continuity of live crown biomass play a significant role in sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is completely consumed in a wildfire, with larger fuels like tree branches and stems being less consumed compared to fine fuels. Different ecosystems are adapted to different fire regimes, from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to frequent wildfires, characterized by large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles. These ecosystems include grasslands, meadows, and natural forested areas dominated by fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine. Surface-fire ecosystems make up about 34% of U.S. wildlands historically fueled by grasses, needles, and shrubs, but heavy grazing in the West has reduced grass cover, allowing fuel loads of branches and small trees to expand. Logging practices in the West have led to an increase in fuel loads, making frequent surface fire ecosystems at risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities that reduce fuel loads have been shown to decrease wildfire severity. On the other hand, ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels that regenerate following fires. The fires in crown-fire ecosystems are relatively infrequent, with some plants resprouting from rootstocks after less than 50 years between fires. These ecosystems, like chaparral and lodgepole pine, account for about 42% of wildlands in the United States. Human activities like grazing and logging have not had much impact on fuel loads or the nature of fires in these ecosystems. Activities to reduce fuel loads may not affect the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in these ecosystems. Fuel ladders do not significantly impact the occurrence of catastrophic crown fires in ecosystems like southern California chaparral. Even in crown-fire ecosystems, wildfires are patchy, leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned. For example, during the Yellowstone fires in 1988, only about half of the reported burned acres were severely affected. Some ecosystems consistently experience mixed fires of limited scale, combining crown fires with low-intensity surface fires. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, like whitebark pine forests, have a variety of fuel sizes and can experience both crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. Whitebark pines grow slowly in harsh conditions, with sporadic mixed-intensity fires helping to regenerate the forest. Clark's nutcrackers play a key role in spreading seeds for regeneration. Other species, like ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine, can also exhibit mixed-fire characteristics under certain conditions. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, such as those with lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir, have uncertain consequences of fuel reduction activities. It is unclear if abnormal levels of fuels could lead to intense crown fires. While reducing fuel loads may help suppress wildfires in some ecosystems, it may not be suitable for all. Additionally, reducing fuel loads may not effectively protect structures and communities from wildfires. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders may be necessary for the safe existence of low-intensity wildfires and prescribed burns. The Hayman Fire in 2002 demonstrated that reducing the risk of crown fires may not always protect infrastructure in the wildland-urban interface. While some homes survived relatively unscathed, others were destroyed by torching or crown fires. Observers suggest the need to expand low-intensity surface fires to maintain natural conditions and values. Reducing fuel loads and modifying fuel characteristics through activities like prescribed burning and thinning can be important for the safe use of low-intensity wildfires and prescribed fires in surface-fire ecosystems. However, thinning and prescribed fires can alter microclimates, increase surface temperatures, decrease fuel moisture, and potentially increase the risk of crown fires. Prescribed burning involves the deliberate use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions. Prescribed burning is a method used to reduce fuel loads and modify fuel characteristics in surface-fire ecosystems. It involves the deliberate use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions to eliminate fine and small fuels, converting biomass to smoke and ashes. However, prescribed fires can escape control and cause extensive damage if conditions change. Prescribed burning is effective in reducing fuel loads and modifying fuel characteristics in surface-fire ecosystems, but it has limitations. It does not significantly impact large diameter fuels or reduce tree density and crown density. Escaped prescribed fires can lead to wildfires with high costs and health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies have policies in place for fire management. Wildland fire use allows natural fires to burn with monitoring, similar to prescribed burning but with nature as the ignition source. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees to reduce biomass fuels, with different approaches such as low thinning. Thinning involves removing trees to reduce biomass fuels, with different approaches like crown thinning and selection thinning. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it allows for controlled removal of trees, reduces crown density, and targets specific fuel components like ladder fuels. Thinning is a method used to reduce biomass fuels by removing trees, but it has disadvantages compared to prescribed burning. It leaves slash on the ground, which increases fuel load in the short run and requires labor-intensive treatments to reduce fire hazards. Thinning can also concentrate biomass growth on fewer stems for larger, more valuable trees, but may not provide effective wildfire protection in crown-fire ecosystems. Thinning combined with prescribed burning is proposed to reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires in mixed-fire regime ecosystems. However, the effectiveness of this approach is limited and costly compared to other alternatives like logging. Commercial logging can reduce crown density but leaves substantial slash, which may not effectively address fuel ladders. Commercial logging focuses on large diameter trees and does not address crown base height, which contributes to the \"ladder effect\" in wildfire behavior. Salvage of standing dead trees might reduce fuels, but standing dead trees that have shed their needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce crown density and fuel ladders, but leaves slash on the ground that can contribute to fire intensity unless treated. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands they administer. Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management have been implicitly authorized to reduce fuels for wildfire protection within their mandate to preserve and protect lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 provides authority for managing public lands to protect various values. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 authorizes federal agencies to manage public lands for conservation, wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and human use. The agencies have broad authority for biomass fuel reduction activities like prescribed burning and thinning, with specific funding programs available. The Forest Service has funding programs for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly in FY2001, continued to rise through FY2008, spiked in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation, and then declined in recent years. Thinning activities are funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account. The Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System funds activities like timber production, reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management. Approximately 20% of appropriations in FY2008 went towards thinning and related activities, with the portion used for thinning varying annually. The Forest Service also has mandatory spending accounts, such as Brush Disposal, which collects deposits from timber purchasers for slash treatments like mechanical efforts, manual efforts, and prescribed burning. These funds are primarily used on timber sale areas. The Brush Disposal account collects deposits from timber purchasers for slash treatments like mechanical efforts, manual efforts, and prescribed burning. The Knutson-Vandenberg Fund is used by the Forest Service to reforest and improve the forest following logging operations. Stewardship contracting allows for forest stewardship activities, such as thinning for fuel reduction, to be included in timber sale contracts. The DOI agencies receive appropriations for fuel reduction activities, including thinning and prescribed burning. Funding comes from the Hazardous Fuels sub-account within the Wildland Fire Management line item. The amount allocated for prescribed burning and the ecosystems treated are not reported. DOI fuel reduction funding has been stable since FY2001, with other activities funded through general land and resource management accounts. These funds can be used for various activities to improve wildfire protection by reducing fuel. Funds from various accounts within DOI agencies can be used for activities that reduce wildfire threats, such as fuel reduction. The specific accounts include Land Resources and Western Oregon Resources Management for BLM, Park Protection and Resource Stewardship for NPS, Resource Management for FWS, and Trust\u2014Natural Resources Management for BIA. The exact portion of funds allocated for fuel reduction activities is unknown. The BLM has a mandatory spending account, the Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund, that can be used for fuel reduction activities to improve wildfire protection. Federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are limited, with the FS offering two wildfire protection assistance programs that can include fuel reduction. Other agencies do not have financial and technical assistance programs for biomass fuel reduction activities on nonfederal lands. The Forest Service (FS) offers two wildfire protection assistance programs: Volunteer Fire Assistance and Community Wildfire Protection. These programs provide technical and financial assistance for fire prevention, fire control, and prescribed burning for fire protection. Allocation of funds is at the agency's discretion, with a focus on fuel reduction activities. Eligibility for Volunteer Fire Assistance is limited to rural volunteer fire departments, while the Community Wildfire Protection program aims to expand outreach, education, and establish defensible space around private homes. The Forest Service (FS) offers programs for wildfire protection, including Volunteer Fire Assistance and Community Wildfire Protection. These programs provide technical and financial assistance for fire prevention, fuel reduction, and establishing defensible space around private homes. The FS has other assistance programs for forest stewardship, forest health protection, and emergency restoration, but no funds have been appropriated for biomass fuel reduction specifically. Funding from State Fire Assistance could potentially be used for this purpose."
