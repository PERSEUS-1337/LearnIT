    "content": "In the mid-1990s, the primary threat posed by NBC weapons to the United States shifted from an all-out U.S.-Russian strategic exchange to less overwhelming, but more numerous and perhaps less predictable threats. The dissolution of the Soviet Union had turned some Russian weapons of mass destruction (WMD) strengths into weaknesses, prompting the U.S. government to help secure Russian WMD infrastructure. U.N. inspections uncovered Iraq's massive NBC weapons programs and a crisis erupted over the North Korean nuclear weapons program. Secretary of Defense William Cohen noted that American military superiority increases the threat of NBC attacks by creating incentives for adversaries to challenge asymmetrically. Congress is concerned about countries and groups with NBC weapons, developing or acquiring them, and those seeking missile delivery. The heightened sense of vulnerability to terrorism post-9/11 has drawn attention to the link between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). President Bush emphasized the threat of terror armed with biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons. The unpredictability of terrorist efforts to acquire NBC weapons poses a serious challenge to global security. The status of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons worldwide has been slowly changing, with stockpiles decreasing over time. The Bush Administration has identified state sponsors of terrorism with NBC weapons programs as significant security threats. This report focuses on the current threat and trends in nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and missiles, highlighting the impact of nuclear tests by India, Pakistan, and North Korea, missile tests by various countries, transfers of dangerous technology, and the interest in NBC weapons among terrorists. These threats affect U.S. security interests and influence national security and foreign policy decisions, including military force structure, weapons acquisition, doctrine and strategy, foreign policy, and economic policy towards countries of proliferation concern. The status and trends of these weapons are crucial factors in national and international debates. The U.S. government is involved in national and international debates on the threat posed by nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as missiles. Key factors include whether states or groups are acquiring these weapons for deterrence or attack, the adequacy of intelligence resources, and the appropriate strategy mix of defense, export control, and arms control. In December 2002, the White House released the \"National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction\" to address NBC weapons proliferation. Counterproliferation efforts aim to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to hostile states and terrorist organizations through interdiction and deterrence. Strengthened nonproliferation involves diplomacy, multilateral regimes, and export controls. Consequence management focuses on homeland defense against WMD threats. Factors facilitating WMD proliferation include technological advancements, free flow of information, and growing disparities in military capabilities. The continued prestige of nuclear power and growing missile capabilities contribute to the perceived utility of NBC threats in deterring U.S. intervention. The debate over threat assessments is subjective, considering technical capabilities and intentions of weapon possessors. Reduction of global tension and economic integration are believed to decrease the need for weapons of mass destruction. The strong U.S. deterrent capability may deter hostile countries from acquiring or using such weapons. The debate over the effectiveness of U.S. National Missile Defense in deterring the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction, including the threat from terrorist groups, is complex. President Bush highlighted the danger of states sponsoring terror possessing WMDs and the risk of terrorists using these weapons without hesitation. The connection between the spread of NBC capabilities to states and the potential availability of technology to terrorists is a significant concern. The spread of advanced weapons and technologies poses a threat to the United States and its allies, increasing the risk of nuclear war and terrorism. Analysts debate whether rogue states would use weapons of mass destruction against the U.S., with some doubting their willingness due to the potential for overwhelming counterattacks. However, the presence of nuclear weapons in proliferating states offers opportunities for exploitation by terrorists, making them a severe threat to global security. The United States government works to reduce the risk of WMD use and proliferation, leading efforts in various international agreements and initiatives. However, some criticize recent U.S. actions for potentially encouraging WMD proliferation, such as developing a national missile defense and withdrawing from treaties. Some critics are concerned that the United States' focus on missile defense systems and refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may hinder broader nonproliferation goals. Observers fear that the U.S. is abandoning its arms control leadership, leading other countries to seek similar freedom of action. Missile defense advocates argue that it strengthens deterrence and prevents rogue states from blackmailing the U.S. or its allies with missile threats. Around twenty-five countries are suspected of having NBC weapons programs or stockpiles. NBC weapon programs and missile capabilities have not significantly grown in the last decade, with some countries actively building NBC weapon stockpiles and improving delivery capabilities. Detection of nuclear and ballistic missile programs is easier than biological and chemical weapons programs due to observable characteristics. The intent and seriousness of a country's pursuit of NBC weapons capability are not portrayed in the data. Threat assessments of WMD capability would be impacted by these variables. Some states are building NBC weapon stockpiles and enhancing delivery capabilities using available missile technology. These states may also have indigenous production capabilities and could potentially supply NBC weapons or missile technologies to others, including terrorist groups. Concerns have grown about the possibility of more countries or terrorist organizations producing NBC weapons. Five states are recognized as nuclear weapon states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), while four others possess nuclear weapons without being NPT signatories. China's nuclear arsenal is not publicly disclosed. China's nuclear arsenal is not publicly disclosed, but it is estimated to have between 90-112 nuclear warheads deployed on land-based ballistic missiles, including CSS-4 ICBMs capable of reaching the continental United States. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, China currently has more than 100 nuclear warheads. China's nuclear arsenal includes a missile with a range of 7,250 km and a XIA-class ballistic-missile submarine with 12 launch tubes. The submarine's operational status is unclear, but it may be a limited component of China's nuclear deterrent force. Beijing may have around 40 nuclear bombs for delivery by aircraft, but they may not be deployed. France's nuclear arsenal consists of approximately 350 warheads deployed on submarines and aircraft. They have four ballistic missile submarines, each capable of carrying 16 SLBMs with multiple warheads. France is also developing a new SLBM with a longer range to replace the current model. Additionally, their nuclear warheads are carried on cruise missiles by Mirage and Super \u00c9tendard aircraft. France is also developing a new ALCM for deployment on certain aircraft models. In July 2007, Russia's strategic nuclear forces included various types of ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, and bomber aircraft. They have approximately 2,000-3,000 operational tactical warheads and 8,000-10,000 stockpiled strategic and tactical warheads. Moscow's strategic forces are designed to deter aggression and are prepared to conduct limited nuclear strikes if necessary. The United Kingdom has fewer than 160 operationally available nuclear warheads. The United Kingdom has fewer than 160 operationally available nuclear warheads deployed on Vanguard-class submarines with Trident D5 SLBMs. The country intends to reduce its reserve stockpile by 20% and plans to develop a new class of replacement submarines. The currently-deployed submarines are projected to leave service in the early 2020s. The UK plans to reduce its nuclear warhead stockpile and develop new submarines. Other countries like Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea have also developed nuclear weapons with varying quantities and capabilities. North Korea has pursued both plutonium and uranium enrichment programs. Iran's nuclear program raised concerns after an IAEA investigation in 2002 revealed undisclosed nuclear activities, including centrifuge and laser enrichment. Despite agreements with the EU-3 to suspend uranium enrichment, Iran was found in noncompliance in 2005. The IAEA referred Iran to the UN Security Council in 2006 due to resuming enrichment activities. Two UN Security Council resolutions imposed sanctions on Iran. The NIE report in 2007 stated Iran had a past nuclear weapons program but halted it in 2003. US officials mentioned Syria as seeking nuclear weapons, with concerns about technology transfer from Pakistan. The IAEA is investigating multiple countries. The IAEA is investigating Syrian nuclear intentions with concern. Despite controls on nuclear technology exports, availability has increased. The exposure of the Khan network in 2004 has prompted calls for further controls on nuclear exports. The total number of nuclear warheads in the world is expected to decline as the US and Russia reduce their stockpiles. China, India, and Pakistan may expand their nuclear inventories. Israel's arsenal is unlikely to change significantly. North Korea has halted plutonium production. China is projected to modernize its nuclear arsenal with more survivable missiles. China is modernizing its nuclear arsenal with new missiles, including the longer-range DF-31A variant and the JL-2 SLBM on a new submarine. The country is expected to have over 100 ICBM warheads capable of reaching the US and could develop warheads with multiple reentry vehicles. China is also working on new air- and ground-launched cruise missiles for nuclear missions, improving the flexibility and survivability of its nuclear forces. Russia's strategic nuclear forces are expected to decline in the next 10 years as aging systems are retired and only small numbers of new missiles are produced. Moscow may deploy new missiles with multiple warheads and is testing a new SLBM. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limits Russia and the US to 1700-2200 strategic warheads, with the treaty expiring in 2012. India and Pakistan intensified their nuclear rivalry in 1998, conducting tests and establishing nuclear doctrines and contingency plans. In 1999, India and Pakistan narrowly averted a full-scale war in Kashmir that could have escalated to the nuclear level. India's quest for nuclear weapons is driven by its desire for major power status and regional competition with China. Concerns about the safety of Pakistani nuclear arsenal grew in 2001 due to riots, ties to the Taliban, and U.S. efforts to secure the weapons. Tensions in Kashmir in 2002 raised fears of a nuclear exchange, while terrorist organizations seek fissile material for nuclear weapons. The erosion of barriers to obtaining low-grade nuclear material for \"dirty bombs\" has raised concerns about terrorist groups using conventional explosives to disperse deadly radioactive material. Several nations, including China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Taiwan, are believed to have some biological weapons capability. Iraq and Libya had biological weapons programs in the past. The concern over biological weapons has shifted from national programs to the prospect of terrorist acquisition. Al-Qa'ida had a BW program before the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan. Aum Shinrikyo's unsuccessful attempts to weaponize anthrax in the 1990s highlighted the challenges in weaponization. Experts believe terrorist groups may struggle to obtain materials and know-how for large-scale lethal effects. The accessibility of biotechnology may enable terrorist groups, especially those with state support, to conduct successful biological warfare. Even a small amount of biological agent dispersed in a densely populated area could result in significant casualties. The covert development of biological weapons is difficult to detect, defend against, and could cause massive casualties or crop destruction. International trade in biological warfare materials and technology remains a concern, with the potential for increased threat as biotechnology advances and global flows of information, people, and goods grow. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), member countries are required to destroy their stockpiles by April 2007. Albania was the first country to destroy its declared CWs in July 2007, with five other states declaring possession of such weapons. Despite pledges to destroy their weapons by April 29, 2012, doubts remain due to technical and legal challenges. Twelve countries reported facilities for CW production and have committed to destroying or converting them. The CWC has reduced the number of parties with chemical weapons and decreased the likelihood of their use, according to the OPCW. The OPCW's Verification Director stated in 2007 that no violations of the CWC have been detected. It is unclear which countries still have CW programs as the Convention has not been fully implemented. Some countries may still be developing or producing CW, with technology and materials available internationally. In 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used sarin in attacks on the Tokyo subway. The Tokyo subway attacks with sarin highlighted the difficulty in disseminating chemical weapons effectively. Terrorist groups may continue efforts to obtain such capabilities, potentially aided by state sponsors. Al-Qaida's pre-2001 chemical weapons program remains uncertain. While small-scale production of CW may increase, restrictions under the CWC are expected to limit large-scale production. The effectiveness of the CWC implementation will play a crucial role in decreasing or increasing the global CW threat in the future. The CIA has identified concerning trends in biotechnology and the development of new, hard-to-detect chemical and biological weapons. Countries are developing new chemical and biological weapons, making detection and countermeasures difficult. Some nations are becoming self-sufficient in producing these weapons and are using civilian applications to conceal their production. Countries with capabilities are acquiring advanced delivery systems, and terrorist groups are seeking access to these weapons. Most countries seeking nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons also have ballistic missiles. North Korea has tested Taepo-dong missiles with potential ICBM capability, but faced failures. Several countries possess ballistic missiles, with some working on developing longer-range missiles. Russia, China, and North Korea have exported missile technology to other countries. Cruise missiles are widely distributed, with many countries possessing and manufacturing them for anti-ship missions. Several countries possess and produce cruise missiles for anti-ship missions, with some capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The spread of production technology has allowed countries like Pakistan and Iran to test medium-range ballistic missiles. Despite promises to restrict exports, Russia, China, and other countries continue to facilitate missile technology transfers. Iran, Libya, and Egypt have been identified as sources of missiles or production technology. Many countries possess and produce cruise missiles, with some capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Production technology has spread, allowing countries like Pakistan and Iran to test medium-range ballistic missiles. Despite promises to restrict exports, Russia, China, and other countries continue to facilitate missile technology transfers. Iran, Libya, and Egypt are identified as sources of missiles or production technology. The availability of technology for missiles is growing rapidly, with satellite-assisted guidance technology improving accuracy. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the war on terrorism is seen as a significant advancement in remotely piloted vehicle technology. Despite the increasing availability of technology, states are not necessarily driven towards acquiring NBC weapons and missiles. Political and economic trends can influence states and terrorist organizations in developing, maintaining, or abandoning NBC weapon or missile capabilities. The risk of nuclear weapons exchange and biological/chemical attacks has decreased in the last decade due to reductions in nuclear weapons, improved safeguarding, and international cooperation. However, threats still persist as Russia possesses thousands of nuclear weapons and has provided WMD technology to other countries. The United States has established initiatives to control the transfer of sensitive technologies to combat terrorist acquisition of NBC weapons. Several Russian organizations have provided WMD technology to Iran, North Korea, and other potentially hostile countries. There is uncertainty about the future of U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear arms control agreements, with the START Treaty expiring in December 2009. China has made commitments to non-proliferation efforts but continues to modernize its nuclear missile force and provide missile technology to other countries. In the 1990s, states strengthened export controls and multilateral control regimes for nuclear weapons, missile technology, and chemical weapons. Key developments included the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the creation of the MTCR in 1987. Despite these efforts, the future of multilateral arms control is uncertain, with no plans for the US to ratify the CTBT or create a verification protocol under the BWC. Former Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, highlighted the challenges of regulating dual-use technologies in the global economy. The globalized economy makes it difficult to track the acquisition of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons by states, terrorist organizations, and criminal groups. Countries like North Korea, China, and Russia are primary suppliers of NBC weapons technology, with concerns about a second tier of suppliers. Former DCI Tenet emphasized the threat of combining assistance from multiple sources to create indigenous capabilities for proliferation. In 2003, concerns were raised about the potential for countries to develop nuclear weapons with the help of proliferators, bypassing traditional weapons programs. Non-state actors were highlighted as key players in proliferation, with the risk of nuclear weapons use being a significant factor. The Khan network was mentioned as a source of WMD materials and technology, with the possibility of other similar networks emerging. Monitoring programs via acquisition activities was becoming more challenging due to countries of concern relying less on foreign suppliers. The risk of nuclear warfare is increasing as more countries acquire nuclear weapons or expand their arsenals. Factors such as inadequate command and control systems, vague strategic doctrine, and poor intelligence on enemy capabilities could heighten this risk. Analysts use key events since the development of nuclear weapons to assess the likelihood of nuclear warfare, with many agreeing that the risk rose in the early 1950s. Security analysts agree that the risk of nuclear warfare increased in the early 1950s and peaked during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Tensions remained high through the 1960s, with a risk of Sino-Soviet confrontation in 1969. The early 1980s saw renewed risk of US-USSR nuclear warfare, but it declined with Gorbachev's opening of the USSR. New risks have emerged in the Middle East, South Asia, and on the Korean Peninsula. The clash in Kargil and Indian-Pakistani tensions present the greatest risk of nuclear war since the Cold War. Some experts believe the threat of nuclear war has diminished, but concerns remain about the potential use of nuclear weapons in Asia or the Middle East. Some countries may consider using nuclear weapons in regional conflicts, raising concerns about the risk of nuclear war due to miscalculation or desperation. Possessing nuclear weapons could deter other countries from using their own, but tensions in regions like Kashmir heighten fears of a nuclear conflict. The possibility of smaller, more targeted nuclear attacks is seen as reducing the threat by some, while others worry that advancements in nuclear technology could make them more usable and destabilizing. The recent criticism of leaks surrounding the new U.S. Nuclear Posture Review suggests that a resumption of nuclear testing could be viewed as destabilizing by observers."
