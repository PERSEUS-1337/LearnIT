    "content": "The 2002 farm bill expanded commodity support to include additional commodities like dry peas, lentils, and wool. The Commodity Credit Corporation pays for this support using a line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Expenditures for commodity support have averaged $12.6 billion per year, but are projected to decrease to $7 billion per year due to high market prices. The USDA's proposed 2007 farm bill aims to save $4.494 billion from the current services baseline of $74.566 billion for commodity support. The USDA's proposed 2007 farm bill aims to save $4.494 billion from the current services baseline of $74.566 billion for commodity support. The modifications are designed to make the programs more market-oriented, predictable, and less market distorting. Support prices for 25 commodities would be adjusted to minimize market distortions and encourage farmers to plant crops based on market prices. Loan rates for each commodity would be set at 85% of the five-year Olympic average of market prices or the rates specified in the House-passed version of the 2002 farm bill. The Administration's proposal in the 2002 farm bill aims to save $4.5 billion over 10 years compared to baseline spending. Questions include federal outlays over the past five crop years, commodities with market prices below proposed levels, impact of using current law loan rates, and consideration of replacing nonrecourse loans with recourse loans. The Secretary proposes changing the calculation of loan deficiency payments (LDPs) for farmers from daily to monthly, citing difficulties in daily price calculations and windfall opportunities for farmers. The change aims to save $250 million over 10 years compared to current spending levels. The Secretary proposes changing the calculation of loan deficiency payments (LDPs) for farmers from daily to monthly to save $250 million over 10 years. Direct payments under the farm bill are made on land with a history of production for specific commodities and are designed to cost about $5 billion per year. The new proposal aims to continue direct payments and maintain current payment rates from 2008 through 2009. The Secretary proposes changing the calculation of loan deficiency payments (LDPs) for farmers from daily to monthly to save $250 million over 10 years. Direct payments under the farm bill are made on land with a history of production for specific commodities and are designed to cost about $5 billion per year. The current payment rates for upland cotton would remain in place from 2008 through 2009, then increase by about 7% in 2010 for the three-year period through 2012. The increase in direct payments aims to maintain payments to farmers under conditions of high market prices and reduced marketing loan program payments. Over the past five years, crop disaster payments totaled $1.3 billion annually, with no payments made for 2005 and 2006 losses yet. The proposal questions if the $5.5 billion increase in direct payments should be used for crop disaster assistance instead. Current eligibility for direct payments does not differentiate based on age or ownership status, and the Secretary's farm bill proposal suggests giving beginning farmers 20% higher direct payments. The USDA's farm bill proposal aims to provide beginning farmers with direct payments 20% higher than other farmers for the first five years, costing $250 million over a decade. The proposal raises questions about defining beginning farmers, the number of beneficiaries, and potential impacts on cropland prices. Counter-cyclical payments were introduced in the 2002 farm bill to stabilize market prices during low periods, costing around $2.5 billion annually. Counter-cyclical payments are proposed to be triggered by a shortfall in national crop revenue rather than a shortfall in the national average price, integrating crop yields and production into the equation. This change is estimated to save $3.7 billion under the OMB 10-year current services baseline. The idea of revenue-based counter-cyclical payments aims to integrate commodity support with disaster assistance and crop insurance, raising questions about the risks and benefits of integration. The text discusses the risks and benefits of integrating crop insurance with a national counter-cyclical revenue program to replace commodity support programs. It also questions the effectiveness of the Administration's farm bill proposal in providing equitable alternatives for farmers not producing program crops. Additionally, it mentions the annual limits on commodity support program payments set by Congress in 1970. The curr_chunk discusses the various payment limits for farmers, including the doubling of the limit to $360,000 under certain allowances, no limit on commodity certificate gains, and an AGI eligibility cap of $2.5 million. It also mentions the regional factor in the debate, with cotton and rice farmers feeling threatened by payment limits. Proponents argue for lower limits to prevent consolidation of farms, while opponents believe large payments are essential for the agricultural safety net. The Secretary has proposed changes to tighten payment limits, including a $360,000 per individual limit and excluding those with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income from commodity program payments. The proposal aims to save $1.5 billion under the current services baseline of $75 billion for commodity support. Questions arise about the impact on farms, individuals, and commodities like cotton and sugar. Concerns also exist about absentee landlords receiving payments and the potential shift towards cash rent leases. The Secretary's proposal aims to tighten payment limits, including a $360,000 per individual limit and excluding those with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income from commodity program payments. The proposal seeks to save $1.5 billion under the current services baseline of $75 billion for commodity support. Concerns exist about the impact on farms, individuals, and commodities like cotton and sugar, as well as absentee landlords receiving payments and the potential shift towards cash rent leases. The proposal would prohibit commodity subsidy benefits to any farm acquired through a 1031 exchange, citing concerns about the escalation of farmland prices hindering new entrants and small farms from expanding. Questions are raised about the use of 1031 exchanges for geographically consolidating farm holdings and whether exemptions should be considered for certain farmers. The new policy proposal aims to tighten payment limits and exclude individuals with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income from commodity program payments. Concerns exist about the impact on farms, individuals, and commodities like cotton and sugar. The proposal would prohibit commodity subsidy benefits to any farm acquired through a 1031 exchange, citing concerns about farmland price escalation hindering new entrants. Questions are raised about exemptions for certain farmers and the impact of commodity subsidies on farmland prices. The Administration proposes to continue the dairy support program at $9.90 per cwt. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program pays dairy farmers when the market price falls below $16.94/cwt. The program, expiring in 2007, is recommended for renewal with a 34% payment rate for FY2008, gradually decreasing to 20% over six years. The MILC program contributes to dairy surpluses and reduces farm milk prices, but some argue it conflicts with price support programs. Large dairy farms feel the payment limit is biased against them. The WTO calculates the dairy price support program's annual support at over $4.5 billion. The current U.S. proposal in the Doha Round aims to reduce amber box support for dairy from $19.1 billion to $7.6 billion. The MILC program has provided $2.4 billion in counter-cyclical payments since 2002, with a projected cost of $793 million for the next 10 years. Changes to other commodity support programs aim to save money, but dairy policy will cost additional money over baseline. The Administration's farm bill proposal suggests changing the MILC program to base payments on a three-year average of milk marketed during FY2004-FY2006, rather than current production levels. This change aims to align the MILC program with other farm bill counter-cyclical programs. Additionally, the United States supports raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar at set prices through nonrecourse loans, but maintains market prices above these levels by limiting supplies through import barriers. The United States sugar market faces challenges with potential excess imports exceeding 1.532 million short tons, leading to estimated costs of $1.107 billion over the next 10 years. The farm bill proposal aims to continue the sugar support program but eliminate the provision to suspend marketing allotments when imports surpass the limit. The Secretary can suspend marketing allotments when sugar imports are projected to exceed 1.532 million short tons, saving $1.107 billion over 10 years. The 2002 farm bill included provisions to enhance cotton export competitiveness and protect domestic textile mills. Step 1 allowed for a downward adjustment in the adjusted world price for upland cotton, increasing the loan deficiency payment to producers. Step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic. The 2002 farm bill included provisions to enhance cotton export competitiveness and protect domestic textile mills through Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 allowed for a downward adjustment in the adjusted world price for upland cotton, increasing the loan deficiency payment to producers. Step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic users of cotton when U.S. prices were higher than world prices. However, Step 2 for upland cotton was repealed by Congress due to violating WTO rules. Step 3 allowed for a special additional import quota for upland cotton when high world prices for U.S. cotton and Step 2 export subsidies created tight supplies for domestic mills. The USDA's farm bill proposes to eliminate Step 1 and Step 3, as they have been used infrequently and their purposes have disappeared. Additionally, Step 2 for extra long staple (ELS) cotton would also be eliminated. The current law prohibits planting fruits, vegetables, and wild rice on program crop base acres, with violation resulting in the loss of payments. Farmers have planting flexibility on base acres, except for fruits and vegetables. Direct payments on base acres are considered minimally production- and trade-distorting for meeting WTO obligations. The planting flexibility restriction was put in place to address objections from producers of high-value specialty crops. The USDA farm bill proposal aims to eliminate the planting restriction on fruits, vegetables, and wild rice on base acres to comply with WTO rules. This could impact producers of these crops and raises questions about the integration of U.S. agriculture and the effectiveness of current subsidy policies. Transferring base acreage between farms is also highlighted as a loophole in current regulations. The USDA farm bill proposal aims to eliminate planting restrictions on certain crops to comply with WTO rules, impacting producers and raising questions about subsidy policies. Transferring base acreage between farms is seen as a loophole in current regulations, with concerns about accelerating the conversion of cropland to nonagricultural uses. The Conservation Security Program provides assistance for addressing water and soil resource concerns. Limited funding of $502 million has constrained the Conservation Security Program to 14% of the nation's watersheds. 19,291 contracts have enrolled 15,411,134 acres into CSP. The Secretary proposes a Conservation Enhanced Payment for farms with program crop base acres. This option would forgo counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan benefits. The proposal raises questions about converting commodity programs into green box payments and creating two categories of CSP participants. The Conservation Enhanced Payment Option raises questions about creating two categories of CSP participants with different benefits. The federal government's response includes the proposal to modify the circuit breaker authority to comply with trade agreements. The Secretary has the authority to make adjustments in domestic commodity support expenditures to avoid exceeding the annual limit on trade distorting subsidies. The United States has not invoked the circuit breaker authority to avoid exceeding the $19.1 billion U.S. amber box limit. Before the 1985 farm bill, conservation programs were limited, but now there are over 20 programs with annual spending of $5.2 billion, mainly funded through recent farm bills with mandatory funding from USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The 2002 farm bill increased funding for agricultural conservation programs, with the Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program making up a significant portion of the current annual spending. The proposed 2007 farm bill outlines an overall increase in funding for agricultural conservation. The proposed 2007 farm bill increases funding for agricultural conservation programs, with a focus on consolidating programs for efficiency. Key changes include an increase in funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). The Administration aims to streamline programs to reduce confusion and improve administrative efficiency. Questions arise regarding expected savings from program consolidations, evaluation measures for conservation efforts, and potential inconsistencies in working lands conservation programs. The Administration proposed increasing funding for CSP and EQIP by $475 million annually in the farm bill proposal. The FY2008 budget proposal, on the other hand, suggests reducing both CSP and EQIP. EQIP is authorized at $1.27 billion, with the President's budget requesting $1.0 billion (a $270 million reduction). CSP is estimated at $451 million by the CBO, with the President's budget requesting $316 million (a $135 million difference). The proposed increases in mandatory conservation programs in the farm bill may supersede the cuts in those programs if the Administration's budget is adopted. EQIP offers cost-share payments, technical assistance, and incentive payments for conservation practices on private working-lands through three sub-programs: GSWC, Klamath Basin Program, and CIG. The GSWC program aims to save water consumption in areas with extensive agricultural water needs, while the Klamath Basin program is limited to a single basin. The Secretary recommends consolidating existing cost-share programs (EQIP, GSWC, WHIP, AMA, Forest Land Enhancement Program, and the Klamath Basin Program) into a newly designed EQIP program. The proposal also includes creating a Regional Water Enhancement Program (RWEP) to address water quality and quantity issues on a regional scale, with additional funding allocated to the CIG program. The newly constructed CIG program would receive an increase of $4.25 billion over the OMB 10-year current services baseline. Interest in conservation programs is high, leading to a backlog of unfunded applications, including 32,633 in EQIP alone worth over $636 million in FY2006. Questions arise about how the additional funding will address the backlog and if USDA has the capacity to handle the workload. USDA's farm bill spending estimates show EQIP's modest growth until reaching full spending authority in 2014, raising concerns about the program taking seven years to reach its authorized spending level. Some proposed programs for consolidation have specific purposes and eligibility requirements targeting resource concerns on different landscape components. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) provides technical and financial assistance to address water and soil resource concerns through conservation practices. It operates with three tiers, with Tier III receiving the highest payments for addressing additional resource concerns on the entire operation. CSP financial assistance includes stewardship, maintenance, cost-share, and enhancement payments. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) provides technical and financial assistance for conservation practices, with limited funding constraining the program to 298 of the nation's 2,119 watersheds. The Secretary proposes adjustments to the program, including the elimination of certain payments, consolidation of tiers, and an expansion of funding to $8.5 billion. Key questions include how the proposed changes will impact participation and whether the Conservation Enhancement Option will overlap with CSP for producers of program crops. The proposed Private Lands Protection Program would consolidate three existing programs - Farmland Protection Program (FPP), Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), and Healthy Forest Reserve Program (HFRP) - into a new program with increased funding. Some question the adequacy of technical assistance in the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and how it can be successfully implemented. The proposed Private Lands Protection Program aims to consolidate the Farmland Protection Program (FPP) and Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) into a new program. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) remove active cropland into conservation uses, providing rental payments and cost-share assistance for environmental improvement. The Secretary recommends reauthorization of CRP with a focus on environmentally sensitive lands, prioritizing whole-field enrollment for energy-related biomass production. The proposal discusses the rationale behind subsidizing cellulose production and potential conflicts with the conservation purpose of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). It also addresses priorities for releasing land from CRP and the consolidation of the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) with the floodplain easement program. The proposal discusses the consolidation of the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) with the floodplain easement program, increasing the enrollment cap to 3.5 million acres. This would result in a significant increase in funding. Questions are raised about the impact on local economies and achieving wetlands conservation goals under a working-lands program. The changes also raise concerns about meeting the President's no-net-loss goal and the impact on farmers participating in USDA programs. The Administration proposes broadening conservation compliance provisions to include new \"Sod Saver\" rules, creating disincentives for converting grasslands into crop production. Sod Saver would make newly converted grasslands permanently ineligible for commodity support and other USDA programs. The proposal's budgetary impact is scored at zero. The basis for the Sod Saver recommendation and concerns about the effectiveness of Sodbuster are raised. Alternative conservation systems to reduce soil erosion were not mentioned in the provision. The Sod Saver proposal aims to prevent grasslands from being converted to cropland by making them ineligible for federal assistance. Questions arise about the rationale behind this prohibition and the potential monitoring and enforcement costs. Additionally, beginning and limited-resource farmers receive incentives in conservation programs, such as increased cost-share payments in EQIP. The Administration recommends reserving 10% of farm bill conservation financial assistance for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged producers, and limited-resource farmers. Flexibility is advised for reallocating unused funds. This proposal would not impact current services baseline. Key questions include the proportion of current conservation program participants who are beginning and limited-resource farmers, the current spending on them compared to the proposed 10% assistance, and the potential exclusion of commercial farmers from conservation programs. The Secretary suggests allocating $50 million over 10 years for developing uniform environmental standards and credit registries to promote private sector environmental services. The Secretary recommends consolidating the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) and the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) to address confusion and frustration in responding to natural disasters. The EWP focuses on watershed impairments from natural disasters, while the ECP focuses on emergency water conservation measures during severe droughts and farmland rehabilitation. The Secretary recommends consolidating the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) and the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) into a new Emergency Landscape Restoration Program to address confusion and frustration in responding to natural disasters. Key questions include which agency would administer the new program and whether there should be a single definition of eligible lands. The 2002 farm bill authorized the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program (TASC) to address barriers related to specialty crops. The program is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation's borrowing authority, with proposed funding increases to $68 million over several years. USDA also plans to increase the maximum project award and allow more flexibility in project timelines. USDA requests funding for a new initiative on a mandatory basis using CCC's borrowing authority to allow for project timeline extensions. The TASC program aims to eliminate SPS and technical barriers to trade in specialty crops, contributing to increased U.S. agricultural exports. The Market Access Program supports overseas marketing activities for U.S. agriculture products. The Market Access Program (MAP) receives funding from the CCC to support generic and brand-name promotion activities. The Administration is considering increasing annual MAP funding by $25 million to address inequities between program crops and non-program commodities. This increase would benefit specialty crop producers and firms. USDA evaluates the impact of MAP to measure its effectiveness in promoting agricultural exports. The Administration's farm bill proposes a new grant program to address SPS issues for all commodities, funded by the CCC at $2 million annually. This program aims to tackle unscientific SPS standards used as non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural products, such as biotechnology restrictions and maximum residue standards. Grants would focus on issues like antimicrobial treatments, wood packaging material, biotechnology, and mycotoxins. The USDA proposes a new grant program funded by the CCC to address SPS barriers affecting U.S. agricultural exports. The program aims to combat unscientific standards used as non-tariff barriers, focusing on issues like antimicrobial treatments, wood packaging material, biotechnology, and mycotoxins. The program seeks to involve the private sector, commission scientific reports, and utilize outside technical experts to address these barriers. Key questions include the significance of current SPS barriers, the allocation of FAS resources for SPS issues, and how the grant program would reinforce U.S. efforts in international standard setting forums and WTO dispute settlement. The USDA requests mandatory funding for the initiative using CCC's borrowing authority to counter technical trade barriers restricting U.S. agricultural imports. The USDA is seeking funding to enhance staff support at international standard setting organizations to influence decision making on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules. They are requesting $15 million over 10 years to close the compensation gap for senior level staff and cover the cost of professional officers focusing on U.S. SPS priorities. The Administration's proposal seeks funding to enhance staff support at international organizations to influence decision-making on SPS rules. The lack of U.S. funding has led the FAO to take a more Eurocentric approach, impacting U.S. efforts to reduce trade barriers. The increase in U.S. agricultural trade disputes has prompted groups to seek recourse under U.S. trade remedy laws and work with USDA and USTR to resolve cases under the WTO process. The Administration's farm bill requests broad discretionary authority for enhanced monitoring and technical assistance. The Administration's farm bill requests broad discretionary authority for enhanced monitoring, technical assistance, and analytical support to assist smaller agricultural groups affected by unfair foreign trade practices. USDA would determine eligibility criteria for this assistance, potentially enabling small groups to pursue trade dispute cases in WTO settlement. The Administration proposes $20 million in funding over 10 years to expand agricultural extension programs in fragile countries like Sudan or Somalia. USDA would engage in agricultural reconstruction efforts to support those dependent on agriculture for food and employment. This funding aims to meet future development assistance needs in unstable areas. The USDA administers programs to facilitate sales of U.S. agricultural exports by providing financing guarantees to foreign buyers. These programs include short-term (GSM-102), intermediate-term (GSM-103), and supplier credit guarantee programs, as well as the Facilities Guarantee Program to improve handling and distribution facilities in emerging markets. Up to $6.5 billion annually was authorized for these programs from FY2002-FY2007, with $1.0 billion targeted for emerging markets. The USDA administers programs to facilitate sales of U.S. agricultural exports by providing financing guarantees to foreign buyers, with up to $6.5 billion annually authorized for these programs. In FY2006, almost $1.4 billion in guarantees were approved, down from previous years due to decreased demand and WTO compliance issues. The Administration proposes statutory changes to reform these guarantee programs in light of the WTO ruling. The USDA is proposing changes to its guarantee programs to comply with WTO regulations. These changes include removing the 1% fee cap, eliminating the GSM-103 program, terminating the SCGP due to loan defaults and fraud, and revising the FGP to attract more users. The cost of changes to the FGP would be minor. Key questions include the impact of higher loan guarantee fees on participation, the prospect of collecting on $200 million in SCGP defaults, and the declining interest in USDA loan guarantees for agricultural imports. The USDA established the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) in 1985 to help U.S. commodities compete with other countries. The program has been inactive in recent years, and the USDA proposes to repeal EEP and the Global Market Strategy report mandate due to redundancy and lack of valuable purposes. The USDA proposes to repeal the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Global Market Strategy report due to redundancy and lack of valuable purposes. The repeal would allow USDA to focus resources on priority issues and align with the U.S. objective to eliminate export subsidies worldwide. The Administration estimates no budgetary impact from the proposal, emphasizing financial savings. Questions arise about the impact on U.S. agricultural exports if the Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations fails and the repeal of the export subsidy program. USDA highlights the usefulness of existing programs like the United Export Strategy and Country Strategy in aiding exporters and policymakers. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized various food aid programs, including the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust and the McGovern-Dole program. Funding for P.L. 480 programs is provided through annual appropriations, with Title I offering low-interest loans and Title II providing donations of U.S. agricultural commodities. The Food for Progress Program, funded by the CCC, supports countries with commodities. The McGovern-Dole program, funded by the CCC, provides commodities and assistance for education and nutrition programs in foreign countries. The program level for FY2006 was $97 million. Donations through the Section 416(b) program depend on CCC commodity availability. The Emerson Trust offers emergency food relief. The Administration seeks authority to quickly procure food for overseas needs. The Administration is seeking authority to quickly procure food for overseas needs, arguing that U.S.-sourced food aid typically takes too long to arrive where needed. The proposal aims to use up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of emergency food to respond more quickly to food security crises. Congress has rejected this idea in the past, but there is no direct budgetary impact associated with the proposal. The Administration is seeking authority to quickly procure food for overseas needs, arguing that U.S.-sourced food aid typically takes too long to arrive where needed. They propose using up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of emergency food to respond more quickly to food security crises. Questions have been raised about the sufficiency of current U.S. food aid program resources and the impact of the Administration's focus on emergency food aid on the availability of food aid for development purposes. Additionally, concerns have been raised about how using U.S. funds to purchase overseas commodities rather than U.S. commodities could affect the willingness of U.S. groups to support the food aid program. Under current law, retirement savings and plans are treated differently depending on the state, type of applicant, and type of plan. Countable assets for food stamp eligibility include retirement and education savings, along with other liquid and illiquid resources. The Administration proposes changes to disregard certain assets for food stamp eligibility. The Administration proposes disregarding retirement savings and plans as assets for food stamp eligibility to encourage savings and remove penalties for those in temporary need. Critics suggest further liberalizing asset treatment, while others believe current state options provide enough flexibility. The proposal is estimated to cost $548 million over five years and $1.305 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposal for retirement savings and food stamp eligibility raises questions about assets held by poor households outside formal plans. Concerns include the unchanged dollar limits on countable assets for over 20 years and the complexity of rules for counting vehicles as assets. Standardizing and simplifying these rules, as proposed for retirement savings, is suggested. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of maintaining a food stamp asset test, given the trend of states eliminating asset tests for TANF benefits, is questioned. The Administration proposes a pilot project to test paying for work-related expenses of food stamp recipients with earnings from employment, aiming to support work and self-sufficiency. USDA would define covered expenses, excluding dependent care costs. The Administration proposes a pilot project to test paying for work-related expenses of food stamp recipients with earnings from employment, aiming to support work and self-sufficiency. USDA would define covered expenses, excluding dependent care costs. Critics question the effectiveness of the project's restrictions on expenses and funding limitations. The Administration proposes to eliminate caps on dependent care expense deductions for food stamp eligibility and benefits to help working families. Critics argue for recognizing high non-food living expenses like shelter costs. The estimated cost of the proposal is $20 million over five years and $42 million over 10 years. The Administration proposes to disregard college savings plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, allowing states to exclude them based on accessibility. Countable assets under the Food Stamp program include liquid resources and some illiquid resources, with a general limit of $2,000 or $3,000 for households with elderly or disabled members. The Administration proposes to exclude IRS-approved college savings plans as assets for food stamp eligibility to encourage education savings, simplify program administration, and prevent penalties for temporary food assistance needs. Critics suggest further liberalizing asset treatment, while others argue for maintaining current rules for education savings. The estimated cost of the proposal is $8 million over five years and $18 million over 10 years. The Administration's proposal for education savings focuses on formal, tax-recognized situations. Questions arise about money saved by poor households for education outside formal plans. Eligibility rules for food stamps include asset limits of $2,000 ($3,000 for elderly or disabled), unchanged for over 20 years. Complex rules for counting vehicles as assets in food stamp eligibility raise concerns about administrative costs. Some states have already eliminated asset tests for TANF benefits. The Administration proposes to disregard combat-related military pay as income for food stamp eligibility, aiming to remove a potential penalty on military families. Critics suggest using the Defense Department's special allowance program instead. The estimated cost of the proposal is $5 million over five years and $10 million over 10 years. The Administration proposes disregarding combat-related military pay for food stamp eligibility to help military families. Critics suggest using the Defense Department's special allowance program instead. The Food Stamp program originated in 1939 with actual stamps, but was later revived in the 1960s with paper coupons. The Food Stamp program, which originated in 1939 with actual stamps, was later revived in the 1960s with paper coupons. Recently, the program switched to using electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards. The Administration recommends renaming the program to the Food and Nutrition program to reflect these changes. The USDA opened up the renaming for public comment and received numerous ideas. Some questions raised include the cost of switching to a new name, the number of states using a different name for their EBT-based program, and the option of keeping the existing name while allowing states to choose their own. The Administration proposes to \"de-obligate\" unredeemed food stamp coupons to save costs. They estimate savings of $2 million over five years and $7 million over 10 years. States are required to pursue collection of over-issued benefits, with collections generally turned over to the federal government. States may keep a portion of collections in certain cases. The Administration proposes measures to address over-issued benefits and losses due to state agency negligence or fraud. They aim to prohibit states from pursuing claims against recipients for widespread systemic errors and require states to pay for over-issuances in such cases. Critics are concerned about the potential impact on state efforts to improve administration. The Administration's proposal aims to address over-issued benefits and losses caused by state agency negligence or fraud. Critics question the need for new authority to collect from states and worry about the impact on state innovation in administering food stamps. States may currently grant automatic food stamp eligibility based on TANF decisions, potentially leading to over-issuances in cases where households have financial resources above the allowed limits. The Administration's proposal aims to restrict categorical eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs. Critics argue that many working households with high non-food expenses would be affected, including those who have transitioned off cash welfare and rely on child care services to maintain employment. They also highlight potential administrative costs and the risk of households losing their food stamp eligibility. The Administration's proposal aims to restrict categorical eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, potentially affecting working households with high non-food expenses. The estimated savings from this proposal are $611 million over five years and $1.360 billion over 10 years. It is included in the Administration's budget package and was advanced as part of the FY2007 budget presentation. The proposal raises questions about the number of households affected, the impact on budget savings in the farm bill proposals, and the extent of overly expansive categorical eligibility in different states. The Administration's proposal aims to restrict categorical eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, potentially affecting working households with high non-food expenses. The proposal raises questions about the impact on budget savings in the farm bill proposals and the extent of overly expansive categorical eligibility in different states. The Administration argues for more flexibility in imposing fines on retailers violating food stamp rules. The Administration proposes new authority to impose fines on retailers for food stamp violations instead of disqualification, with potential savings estimated at $5 million over five years and $10 million over 10 years. Critics question the need for this authority, citing concerns about the clarity of the problem, lack of aggressive use of existing authority, and potential conflicts with other laws. The Administration proposes new authority for the USDA to seize retailers' food stamp receipts in certain egregious trafficking cases to increase enforcement effectiveness. Critics are concerned about potential misuse of this authority and lack of protections for accused retailers. The Administration proposes new rules to disqualify those who exchange food purchased with food stamp benefits for cash, potentially making it a felony or misdemeanor subject to fines or imprisonment. The proposal aims to address cases of misuse and trafficking in food stamp benefits. In FY2005, the national overpayment rate for food stamp benefits was 4.53% and underpayments were valued at 1.31%. States with consistently high error rates may face fiscal sanctions. Eight states are at risk of sanctions, with current liabilities totaling $3.6 million. Ten states received bonus payments totaling $24 million for low error rates. The food stamp QC system also measures states' improper denial, suspension, or termination of applicants/recipients. In FY2005, the national average negative action error rate was 6.91%, with nine states having rates 50% or more above the national average. States with high error rates may receive bonus payments for low rates. Overpayment and underpayment error rates were at a historic low in FY2005, while negative action error rates have been rising. The Administration proposes penalties for states with high negative action error rates to promote program integrity. The Administration proposes penalties for states with high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. Critics are concerned about the large penalty imposed without adequate grounds and the re-opening of the 2002 farm bill agreement. The proposal aims to save $57 million over five years and $166 million over 10 years. The sanction method for high rates of negative actions involves substantial differences compared to previous practices. The Administration's proposal aims to eliminate the option for states to invest in administrative improvements as an alternative to paying part of their QC fiscal sanction. Critics argue that this recommendation unnecessarily re-opens the 2002 agreement without sufficient rationale, with minimal estimated cost savings. The USDA's proposal aims to eliminate states' option to invest in administrative improvements instead of paying fiscal sanctions, with concerns over rising obesity rates among Americans. The Administration also plans to add specific language to the Food Stamp Act regarding nutrition education as an approved activity under the program. The USDA is concerned about the rising obesity rates among Americans. They have various programs in place to combat obesity, including nutrition education initiatives for low-income households and schoolchildren. The Administration's proposal includes a $20 million per year initiative to address obesity among low-income Americans, with ideas such as point-of-sale incentives for purchasing fruits and vegetables. The USDA has programs to combat obesity, including a $20 million initiative for low-income Americans. State plans for distributing TEFAP commodities may become effectively permanent under the Administration's proposal. The Administration argues that the current once-every-four-years rule for state TEFAP agencies is burdensome, while critics question if it is truly burdensome for states. They emphasize the importance of TEFAP state plans and suggest that a complete plan review every four years can lead to program improvements. Critics also highlight that other USDA nutrition programs have more frequent plan requirements. The Administration proposes re-competing contracts with TEFAP distributing organizations every three years to encourage efficiency and lower fees. Critics question the need for frequent contract renewals and how competitive selection would work across varying state programs. The Administration's proposal to re-compete contracts for TEFAP distributing agencies every three years is being questioned for its potential impact on termination and reassignment of contracts, federal rules for competitive solicitations, and the confusion it may cause among recipients. The method for allocating federal payments for administrative costs for FDPIR is also being revised to be more closely tied to participants served. The Administration is seeking increased funding of $26-$27 million over 10 years to support a revised allocation method for FDPIR administrative costs. Critics question the inclusion of this initiative in the farm bill and its alignment with current FDPIR law. Concerns remain about the decision-making process and the potential impact on tribal organizations. The Administration's proposal for the FDPIR program includes changes to disqualify individuals from food stamps if they are disqualified from the FDPIR. Critics question the need for new provisions in the law to achieve this goal. The Administration proposes changes to disqualify individuals from food stamps if they are disqualified from the FDPIR program. Additionally, the proposal aims to disregard the value of SFMNP vouchers in means-tested public assistance programs to align with other nutrition assistance benefits. States may be prohibited from participating in the SFMNP if they charge sales taxes on food purchased with vouchers. The Administration proposes changes to align SFMNP voucher treatment with other nutrition assistance benefits. A $6 million survey of school food purchases is suggested to improve USDA efforts and assess economic impacts. Critics question if this belongs in the farm bill and suggest achieving the goal through regular appropriations. The Administration proposes an additional $50 million a year for the purchase of fruit and vegetables specifically for the School Lunch program. Critics are concerned about the lack of increase in fruit and vegetable purchases and the silence on expanding existing programs. The Administration proposes an additional $50 million a year for fruit and vegetable purchases for the School Lunch program. \"Section 32\" is a permanent appropriation that earmarks funds for various farm sector activities, including purchasing commodities for schools. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service purchases fruits and vegetables exceeding $900 million annually. To promote healthy diets, the USDA plans to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million per year and $2.75 billion over 10 years. Critics are concerned about the impact on other commodities supported by Section 32. The Administration's farm bill proposal does not allocate new spending for this increase, raising questions about how the costs will be covered and if purchases of other products like meats and seafood will be reduced. The Administration's proposal raises questions about the impact on purchases of meats and seafood, unobligated funds in the Section 32 account, legislative authority, allocation of commodity acquisitions for nutrition programs, differences from a separate initiative for fruit and vegetable purchases, and the need for broad legislative authority to administer Section 32 programs. The Administration proposes revisions to the USDA's Farm Service Agency loan programs to enhance availability for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers. Changes include increasing the maximum size of individual direct loans and targeting more loans to these groups. The cost is zero against the budget baseline as programs are funded by discretionary appropriations. Appropriators will still control spending levels. The Administration proposes to double the targeting percentage for direct operating loans and increase the targeting of direct farm ownership loans. New re-pooling procedures would redistribute funds to targeted groups of farmers in other states before others. Additionally, they plan to enhance the beginning farmer down payment program by lowering interest rates, eliminating property value caps, decreasing producer contributions, deferring payments, and adding socially disadvantaged farmers as eligible applicants. They also propose to raise the borrower limit on direct farm ownership and operating loans to a combined $500,000 limit. The proposed increase in the borrower limit on direct farm ownership and operating loans to a combined $500,000 limit is not indexed for inflation, unlike guaranteed loans. The 25% increase may not be sufficient given the rise in land prices and input costs since the 1980s. A study in 2002 questioned the need for the direct loan program in light of changes in government loan programs. The USDA believes direct farm loans are still necessary despite cuts to direct rural housing loans. The pilot program to guarantee contract land sales under the 2002 farm bill has not been reauthorized. The Administration's position on expanding the lending authority of the Farm Credit System is in question. The USDA Rural Development administers programs such as the Critical Access Hospital Program and Community Facilities program to support healthcare services and essential community facilities in rural areas. The Administration proposes mandatory funding for reconstruction and rehabilitation of Rural Critical Access Hospitals. The Administration is proposing $500 million in the 2007 farm bill for backlogged loan and grant applications to further the development of infrastructure projects in rural areas. The funding aims to provide essential services for sustainable economic development and improve the quality of life. The question remains on how the funds will be allocated among communities and projects to eliminate the backlog effectively. The Administration's 2008 budget proposes terminating the Community Facilities Grant program and \"Community Connect\" Broadband Grants. The farm bill reauthorization is proposed for broadband access, distance learning, and telemedicine programs. Loans and grants for business development and expansion are long-standing programs to assist rural areas with economic diversification and new opportunities. The USDA Rural Development focuses on business planning, labor training, and infrastructure loans and grants. The Administration's farm bill proposes consolidating various programs into new platforms and increasing funding for renewable energy systems and efficiency improvements. The expanded funding aims to support a variety of renewable energy activities across different geographic areas. The Administration's energy grants proposal aims to support the establishment of a viable cellulosic ethanol industry through increased funding and loan guarantees. The proposed consolidation of loan programs and prioritization of biorefinery construction could provide quality employment and economic development opportunities for rural America. The Administration's proposal aims to support cellulosic ethanol projects by raising loan caps and prioritizing funding for biorefinery construction. Questions arise about the level of funding for this technology and potential crowding out of other renewable energy solutions. The Administration proposes to consolidate rural grants programs to enhance assistance to rural areas and streamline business grants. The 2008 budget request includes terminating programs like Rural Business Enterprise Grants, raising questions about their elimination's impact on rural entrepreneurial efforts. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposes consolidating rural grants programs to improve assistance to rural areas and streamline business grants. Questions arise about the impact of terminating programs like Rural Business Enterprise Grants on rural entrepreneurial efforts. The FY2008 budget proposes terminating Economic Impact Grants and Community Facility Grants, citing duplication with other federal programs. Questions arise about funding for rural areas with high unemployment and outmigration, and support for essential rural community facilities. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized USDA programs in agricultural research, education, and economics through FY2007, with agencies like ARS, CSREES, ERS, and NASS involved. The Administration proposes consolidating ARS and CSREES into a single agency called the Research, Education, and Extension Service (REES). Land grant universities also propose a reorganization plan (CREATE-21) to combine ARS and CSREES, keep ERS and NASS in the research mission area, and establish a national institute for research on food and agriculture. The Carter Administration merged ARS, CSRS, and the Extension Service into SEA in the 1970s, citing reasons like reducing redundancy and improving coordination. However, the merger was undone in the Reagan Administration. The proposed Chief Scientist is expected to take steps to consolidate ARS and CSREES into REES, following a reorganization plan by land grant universities. The proposed Chief Scientist is expected to create a well-coordinated single agency united behind its mission. The Administration's proposal regarding ERS and NASS, as well as the placement of Forest Service research, is under discussion. ARS and CSREES may be consolidated, following a reorganization plan by land grant universities. The Administration's proposed budget cuts formula funds to states while maintaining or increasing ARS appropriation. Questions arise about how the proposed merger of ARS and CSREES would treat different funding mechanisms and potential changes to formula funding. The CREATE-21 proposal aims to double funding for agricultural research and extension over seven years without disadvantaging ARS or state research institutions financially. Discussions include the use of mandatory funds to support increased funding for agricultural research and extension. The Administration proposes creating an Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative with $50 million in annual funding for 10 years. This initiative aims to make agricultural biomass a viable alternative to petroleum and develop industrial products from bioenergy byproducts. Additionally, a new Specialty Crops Research Initiative with $100 million in annual funding is proposed, including both intramural and extramural programs. Questions arise about potential displacement of current ARS work, Department of Energy management control, and collaboration between public and private research. The Administration's proposed Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative includes $50 million annually for 10 years to develop agricultural biomass as an alternative to petroleum. A new Specialty Crops Research Initiative with $100 million annually is also proposed, raising questions about potential displacement of current ARS work and collaboration between public and private research. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center, transferred to DHS in 2002, is considered outdated for current biosecurity research needs. The Department of Homeland Security is planning to replace the aging Plum Island Animal Disease Center with a new \"National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility\" (NBAF) for research on high consequence foreign animal diseases. Congress has allocated $46 million for planning and site selection, with an estimated construction cost of $451 million. DHS has selected 18 sites in 11 states for further consideration, with construction expected to be completed by 2013. Plum Island is currently the only approved facility in the U.S. for studying high-consequence foreign livestock diseases. The Administration proposes changing the law to allow research and diagnostics for highly infectious foreign animal diseases on mainland locations in the United States. Plum Island and USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories are the only BSL-3 agriculture facilities in the U.S. DHS is proceeding to build a new laboratory, NBAF, for research on high consequence foreign animal diseases. The question arises whether the Secretary of Agriculture will use his regulatory authority to allow research on the mainland if Congress does not change the law. The USDA is being questioned about their involvement in the decision to build a new lab for high consequence foreign animal diseases. Critics are concerned about the risks of locating the facility in regions where livestock are raised, compared to a coastal site like Plum Island. The risks of biosecurity breaches and disease spread between animal and human diseases are being evaluated for site selection. The USDA's Forest Service manages the National Forest System, funds forestry research, and provides assistance. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposes new forestry programs, but does not reauthorize the Forest Land Enhancement Program. The Administration is proposing a new program of financial and technical assistance to state forestry agencies to develop and implement Statewide Forest Resource Assessments and Plans to address the increasing public demand for forest products and amenities, pressure on landowners to convert forests to other uses, and risk from wildfire. Key questions include the effectiveness of statewide planning compared to direct landowner assistance programs, the results of existing cost-share assistance programs for private landowners, and how national direction for statewide forest planning can accommodate diverse forests. The Administration is proposing a new program for statewide forest planning without federal oversight. Key questions include funding, addressing demand for forest products, and the aging of family forest landowners. The proposal includes a landscape-scale forestry grant program to address local forest management issues and stimulate local economies. Key questions include how landscapes will be defined for the grants and the involvement of landowners within the landscape. The Administration is proposing a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to accelerate development and use of new technologies for low-grade woody biomass. Key questions include program goals, progress monitoring, and effectiveness assessment. The Administration is proposing a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to accelerate development and use of new technologies for low-grade woody biomass. Key questions include program goals, progress monitoring, effectiveness assessment, potential for converting woody biomass to cellulosic ethanol, costs, biomass conversion factors, and other critical factors for improved utilization of low-value woody biomass for energy. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposes a community forests working lands program to provide financial assistance to acquire and conserve forests, addressing the problem of producing goods and services from forests at the urban fringe. The proposed community forests program differs from the existing Forest Legacy program, and the federal role in funding and responsibility is also discussed. The federal role in funding and assisting communities in acquiring and conserving local forestlands is outlined in the 2007 farm bill. The bill includes provisions for renewable energy systems and programs for renewable energy production and commercialization. However, some expiring provisions from the 2002 farm bill are not mentioned, such as Biorefinery grants and the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program. The 2007 farm bill outlines federal funding for local forestland conservation and renewable energy programs. However, some expiring provisions from the 2002 farm bill, like Biorefinery grants and the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, were not funded or implemented. The USDA's energy proposal includes increased funding for renewable energy programs, with a focus on cellulosic ethanol projects. Progress has been made in coordinating energy development activities between USDA and the Department of Energy, but there is still room for improvement. The Renewable Energy Program aims to further renewable energy and biofuels development. The farm bill proposal includes incentives for developing a cellulosic-based ethanol industry, but questions remain about its potential and economic implications. Challenges include biomass material handling, competition with cattle forage on marginal lands, and concerns about degrading Conservation Reserve Program acreage. The future of the corn-based ethanol industry and the geographic shift of cellulose-based ethanol production towards cheaper lands are also uncertain. The geographic shift of ethanol production towards cheaper lands in America raises questions about the future of corn-based ethanol plants and the impact on individuals who have invested in them. The $0.54 per gallon tariff on imported ethanol provides some protection for American ethanol blenders, but it limits access to ethanol supplies in major coastal regions, potentially creating a supply problem. The U.S. ethanol industry receives import protection through a tariff and substantial support from tax credits and the Renewable Fuels Standard. Federal subsidies for ethanol production amount to billions annually, raising concerns about limiting the development of new sustainable energy technologies. The Administration recommends changes to the Federal Procurement of Biobased Products program, including additional funding of $2 million per year. They propose consolidating loan program authorities, prioritizing funding for biorefinery construction, and raising the loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants to $100 million. Increased funding of $210 million would support guaranteed loans over 10 years, with a focus on cellulosic ethanol projects. The Administration proposes prioritizing funding for biorefinery projects, emphasizing energy development in rural areas, particularly cellulosic ethanol production. Questions arise about the level of funding for this technology and potential impacts on other renewable energy solutions. Concerns also exist about the long-term competitive advantage of cellulosic ethanol facilities in rural areas. The Administration proposes consolidating USDA energy grant programs under the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, with $500 million in mandatory funding over 10 years. The focus is on promoting renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. Questions remain about the funding's distribution across different renewable energy types and geographic locations, as well as coordination with DOE efforts. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) aim to convert active cropland into conservation uses for environmental benefits. The CRP program, with a budget of $1.828 billion in FY2005, focuses on reauthorizing lands that provide the most benefit for environmentally sensitive areas, with priority given to lands used for energy-related biomass production. Biomass harvesting would occur after nesting season, with rental payments limited to income foregone or costs incurred for conservation requirements during biomass production years. The proposal raises questions about conflicting components in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) regarding biomass harvesting on environmentally sensitive lands. The Administration suggests consolidating USDA energy grant programs under the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, with proposed funding of $500 million over 10 years. Additionally, a new Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative is proposed. The proposal includes creating an Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative with $50 million annual funding for 10 years. It aims to make agricultural biomass a viable alternative to petroleum and develop industrial products from bioenergy byproducts. Questions raised include potential displacement of current ARS work, Department of Energy's management control, and collaboration between public and private research. Another proposal is a $150 million wood-to-energy program to use low-grade woody biomass for forest health and wildfire risk mitigation. Goals and conversion potential are key aspects of this proposal. The program goals for this proposal include converting woody biomass to cellulosic ethanol and comparing it with burning biomass for electricity production. Factors such as costs, biomass conversion, capital costs, infrastructure, and collection opportunities are critical for utilizing low-value woody biomass for energy. The federal crop insurance program has been enhanced with new federal spending measures to make it more affordable for farmers. The federal crop insurance program has seen increased subsidies but has not eliminated disaster payments. The proposed changes aim to enhance participation, reduce costs, and allow farmers to purchase insurance for their deductible portion. The Administration proposes cost-saving measures for the federal crop insurance program, including reducing premium subsidies, charging premiums for catastrophic coverage, and requiring private insurance companies to absorb more costs. Farmers would need to purchase crop insurance to participate in farm commodity support programs. The estimated annual cost of the proposed supplemental deductible coverage is $35 million. The changes aim to prevent the need for multi-billion dollar disaster payment programs and increase farmer participation in the program. The \"Section 32\" appropriation, established in 1935, allocates 30% of customs receipts to support the farm sector. Currently, around $7 billion annually is transferred to the USDA for child nutrition programs, with a portion used to purchase non-price-supported commodities for schools. This includes both \"entitlement\" and \"bonus\" commodities, totaling over $900 million. The USDA proposes to increase purchases of fruits and vegetables using Section 32 authority by at least $200 million per year. The Administration's FY2008 budget does not reflect this proposal, raising questions about how the increased purchases will be funded. Additionally, there are concerns about potential reductions in other food purchases, such as animal products, to cover the cost of the fruit and vegetable increases. The Department routinely carries over funds from the Section 32 account at the end of each fiscal year. The USDA proposes to increase fruit and vegetable purchases using Section 32 authority by $200 million per year. Questions arise about funding sources, potential reductions in other food purchases, and the Department's use of unobligated funds carried over from the previous fiscal year. The Department is proposing new mandatory funding to support organic farming growth. Questions arise about funding sources for increased program oversight and enforcement as certified operations increase."
