    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal State Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2008\" amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to include provisions for state ocean and coastal renewable energy planning. This involves conducting surveys, identifying renewable energy sites, and planning for their development. The Act allows grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy development, considering various elements like hydrography, marine ecosystems, and existing marine uses. The Act allows grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy development, including inventories of shore and offshore locations and infrastructure. Coastal States are encouraged to facilitate participation from relevant stakeholders, and the Secretary will publish guidelines for grant applications and usage. Annual grants may be provided to coastal States for this purpose from 2009 to 2012. The Secretary may grant up to $750,000 to a coastal State for developing a renewable energy survey. Before 2011, no state matching funds are required, but after 2011, a matching fund contribution is needed based on a 2-to-1 ratio in 2011 and a 1-to-1 ratio in 2012 for surveys of coastal waters. No matching funds are required for surveys of Federal waters. After an initial grant, subsequent grants to a coastal State under this section are subject to Secretarial review. No coastal State can receive grants for more than 3 fiscal years. The section does not grant new authority to coastal States or supersede existing Federal agency authority over renewable energy facilities on the outer Continental Shelf. Priority is given to areas suitable for renewable energy development identified in surveys. Federal agencies prioritize potential renewable energy development identified in surveys for siting, licensing, leasing, or permitting. Unsuitable areas should be avoided to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary provides technical assistance to coastal States for survey development and encourages other Federal agencies to participate. Renewable energy is defined as wind, wave, current, tidal, or ocean thermal energy. Authorization of appropriations under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to include grants under section 306B for necessary sums."
