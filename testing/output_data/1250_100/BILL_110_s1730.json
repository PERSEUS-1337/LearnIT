The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2007\" allows states to create modified employability plans for recipients of assistance with disabilities or caring for a family member with a disability, including reasonable modifications of work activities and hourly participation requirements based on the State's evaluation of the family's circumstances. Services, supports, and modifications will be provided by the State to the recipient. The State will provide assistance to recipients or their families, developed in cooperation with the recipient and reviewed every 6 months.
