    "content": "A stable, democratic, prosperous Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests. The country has a troubled history of democracy with frequent power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. Military regimes have ruled for a significant portion of Pakistan's existence, with the armed forces often seizing power from civilian-led governments. Pakistan has had five Constitutions, the latest ratified in 1973 and modified multiple times. The military sees itself as the \"savior of the nation,\" with limited public support. Pakistan has a history of political turmoil with prominent leaders facing exile, assassination, and imprisonment. A 2004 survey showed a lack of understanding of democracy among Pakistanis. The country was ranked as the 33rd weakest in terms of state weakness in 2008, with low scores for political institutional effectiveness and citizen security. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007 was a significant blow to the nation. Pakistan's security situation has sharply deteriorated with armed rebellions in provinces and FATA, along with numerous suicide bomb attacks in 2007 and 2008. President Musharraf's governance structure is under strain, leading to his controversial reelection and eventual resignation. Popular opposition to military rule has been growing due to political crises, including attempts to dismiss the Chief Justice and Supreme Court rulings damaging Musharraf's credibility. President Musharraf launched a \"second coup\" by suspending the country's Constitution and assuming emergency powers, dismissing uncooperative Supreme Court justices, and cracking down on opposition figures and media outlets. The emergency order was lifted on December 15, but concerns remained about the lack of meaningful change. On February 18, 2008, Pakistan held elections which resulted in the Pakistan Muslim League-Q being swept from power in favor of the PPP and PML-N, overseen by Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif respectively. Despite fears of violence and rigging, the election day was calm with higher turnout than in 2002. Musharraf had issued decrees and amendments to the Constitution to prevent challenges to his actions under emergency rule. The PPP and PML-N formed a ruling coalition in Islamabad after the 2008 elections in Pakistan. They aim to restore the 1973 Constitution, reinstate dismissed judges, and legislate sovereign powers back to Parliament. President Musharraf's efforts to stay in power have alienated secular and liberal forces. Despite this, he called the election a milestone and vowed to work with the new Parliament to combat terrorism and promote economic growth. The 2008 elections in Pakistan were seen as a vindication of late leader Zardari's wife's fight for democracy and a rejection of President Musharraf's rule. The results highlighted support for moderate political parties and posed challenges for U.S. policy makers. Economic anxieties, rising inflation, and extremism were key concerns for the new government. Extremism and militancy plagued Pakistani society post-2001, especially in 2007. Suicide bombings targeted security forces and civilians after the elections, causing numerous casualties. The National Assembly completed its term for the first time without interruption, with a caretaker government appointed by President Musharraf. Analysts criticized the caretaker cabinet for being biased towards Musharraf supporters, raising concerns about election credibility. Reports of government attempts to manipulate the election surfaced. Over 13,500 candidates competed for 272 National Assembly seats and 577 provincial assembly constituencies. Amendments to the Pakistani Constitution were also discussed. The Pakistani Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for amendments and impeachment of the president. Opposition parties debated whether to participate in elections believed to be manipulated by the government. After Benazir Bhutto's assassination, the Election Commission postponed the polls to February 18, sparking a national debate. Despite criticism, main opposition parties chose to participate, while the Musharraf-allied PML-Q party faced challenges in convincing voters. The Bush Administration supported demands for timely elections. The U.S. goals for Pakistan include a successful transition to democracy and civilian rule through credible elections. Over $26 million in U.S. aid was allocated for democracy-related programs in FY2007. Despite election day violence, voter turnout was solid, with nearly 45% nationwide. International and domestic observers were present during the election, with preliminary statements acknowledging some shortcomings in providing a level playing field for the campaign. The Democracy International mission identified a flawed pre-election environment but considered the election day itself as positive. Pakistan's print media were cautiously optimistic about the fair and violence-free elections, which contributed to economic stability. The PPP won the majority of seats in the National Assembly, viewed as a referendum on President Musharraf's rule. Pakistan's electoral system allowed Sharif's party to win a majority in the National Assembly, forming a ruling coalition with secular opposition parties. The MQM also performed well, while the PPP secured a majority in Sindh and PML-N dominated in Punjab. The ANP made a comeback in the NWFP, forming a coalition with the PPP in the provincial assembly in Lahore. The PML-Q retained power in Baluchistan, while the new National Assembly was wealthier and more secular. The PPP's vote share increased to 31%, with the PML-N performing well in southern Punjab. The election outcome was seen as a victory for moderate pro-democracy parties over religious-based politics. The recent elections in Pakistan reflected the will of the voters, signaling a shift away from traditional feudal-patronage politics. The opposition parties have called for President Musharraf's resignation, who is willing to work with the new Parliament. There is a potential for a two-thirds opposition majority to reverse changes made during his rule, including parts of the Constitution. A PPP-led government may not reach a super-majority to impeach him. The opposition alliance in Pakistan is unlikely to gather enough votes in the Senate to remove President Musharraf through impeachment. Negotiations for coalition building resulted in an agreement between PPP and PML-N leaders to share power, promising to restore deposed judges within 30 days and implement a Charter of Democracy. The March 9 \"Murree Declaration\" signed by Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif aimed to limit the president's powers and was seen as a rejection of military-bureaucratic rule in Islamabad. The PPP-led coalition gained support from the JUI-F faction and independent parliamentarians. Fahimda Mirza became Pakistan's first female National Assembly Speaker. Intra-PPP discord arose over the party's prime ministerial candidate. In early March, intra-PPP discord arose over the party's prime ministerial candidate, with some leaders unhappy with Fahim and seeking a leader from Punjab. Sharif's PML-N pushed for a Punjabi Prime Minister, while the anti-Musharraf faction opposed Fahim due to his contacts with the unpopular president. On March 22, Asif Zardari announced Yousaf Raza Gillani as the prime ministerial candidate. Gillani, a party stalwart from Punjab, won 264 of 306 votes on March 24 to become Pakistan's new Prime Minister. The junior coalition partners hold three ministries, with other important federal ministers including Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Defense Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar, and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar. Asif Zardari has considered himself as the PPP's prime ministerial candidate, but analysts believe he may be grooming himself for the future. As Bilawal Bhutto Zardari completes studies at Oxford University, he is set to run the PPP. Zardari, a controversial figure in Pakistan, has faced multiple corruption and murder charges, some unresolved. Despite legal issues, he may be eligible to serve as Prime Minister. Nawaz Sharif could benefit from political turmoil and potentially serve as Prime Minister again. Analysts suggest Sharif may be aiming for early elections to surpass the PPP nationally. Nawaz Sharif's potential candidacy for Prime Minister is hindered by past criminal convictions. His history with Islamist parties and anti-Western rhetoric raises concerns in Washington. The PPP and PML-N, historically bitter enemies, have recently come together in a rare show of unity against President Musharraf. However, analysts are skeptical that this alliance will last once Musharraf is no longer in power. Several post-election moves by Asif Zardari have raised doubts about the PPP-PML-N coalition's longevity, including gestures towards the MQM party and statements lauding Musharraf. Intra-party rumblings in the PPP have sparked reports of a potential split led by Sindh party leaders unhappy with the new federal cabinet. Additionally, the dismissal of Supreme Court justices and their replacement by those appointed by Musharraf during a state of emergency in 2007 remains a contentious issue. The new Prime Minister ordered the release of detained judges and planned to restore the pre-November 3 Supreme Court, potentially leading to Musharraf's removal from office. The recently retired Attorney General rejected the plan, stating that only a constitutional amendment could reverse Musharraf's actions. Legal experts disagreed, arguing that Musharraf's emergency imposition was unconstitutional. The lawyer's movement in Pakistan arose in response to Musharraf's dismissal of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in March 2007. Critics of the new government's efforts to restore the judiciary call it a farce rooted in revenge. The movement continues to boycott courts and organize protests, with Chaudhry's public support. Nawaz Sharif accused the U.S. government of discouraging the restoration of deposed judges, while Deputy Secretary John Negroponte admitted to U.S. silence on the matter. Aitzaz Ahsan, a key figure in the movement to restore the pre-November 3 judiciary in Pakistan, accused the U.S. government of callousness towards Musharraf's crackdown on the Supreme Court. He was detained post-emergency and released after four months, continuing to advocate for the judges' release. President Musharraf attempted a deal to relinquish his powers in exchange for dropping efforts to restore the deposed judges, seen as a sign of desperation. President Musharraf's desperation is evident as he seeks Parliament's two-thirds majority for the restoration of judges. However, PPP leader Asif Zardari may not support this due to past grievances. The army, under new leadership, is distancing itself from Musharraf and direct involvement in governance, with Gen. Kayani implementing reforms to limit military interference in civilian affairs. Gen. Kayani is working to limit military interference in civilian affairs and improve the military's image. He has made new appointments and emphasized the military's role in maintaining security during elections. The National Command Authority will retain control over Pakistan's nuclear weapons arsenal. The army's interference in Parliament's actions could damage its non-partisan image. The 2008 polls allowed the Bush Administration to recognize the restoration of a democratically elected government. The Bush Administration recognized the restoration of a democratically elected government in Pakistan after a 101-month hiatus, removing coup-related aid sanctions. The Administration faced challenges due to the loss of Benazir Bhutto and declining popularity of President Musharraf. With a rejection of Musharraf's allies in the elections, the Administration's policy was in disarray, leading to pressure to work more closely with civilian forces. The U.S. government is facing pressures to work closely with civilian and military leaders in Pakistan. There are concerns that the Bush Administration may be supporting Musharraf despite his lack of public support, leading to potential interagency disputes. The State Department aims for a government in Pakistan that will be an effective partner in confronting extremism. The White House expresses support for President Musharraf in Pakistan, highlighting his efforts in counterterrorism and compliance with requested actions. The new government in Pakistan will determine specific details of coalition formation and judicial reforms. Senior Bush Administration officials are recognizing the importance of various political figures in Islamabad and vow to work with all of them. Many Pakistanis are sensitive to U.S. attempts to influence post-election coalition-building, leading to resentment. Analysts urge the U.S. to respect Pakistani sovereignty and self-determination. Deputy Secretary Negroponte's visit signals a shift in U.S. policy towards Pakistan. The timing of Negroponte's visit to Pakistan sparked criticism in the Pakistani press, with some viewing it as American interference before the new government was fully formed. However, Pakistani officials clarified that the visit was planned beforehand and coincided with the government formation. Senator Joe Biden praised Pakistan for holding free and fair elections and advocated for a shift from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistani policy. Biden also proposed increasing U.S. economic aid to Pakistan to $1.5 billion. Committee hearing on Pakistan, Biden proposed tripling U.S. economic and development aid to $1.5 billion, adding an annual \"democracy dividend\" of $1 billion to reward Islamabad for peaceful transition to democracy, and demanded transparency and accountability in military aid. U.S. assistance to Pakistan gaining wider acceptance in Congress. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte emphasized strong partnership with Pakistan, focusing on fighting extremism and promoting economic growth. United States committed to helping build a secure, prosperous, and free society in Pakistan. In 2008, the United States faces a new political dispensation in Islamabad that may differ on methods to combat religious extremism. U.S. officials met with new Pakistani leaders, with President Bush and Prime Minister Gillani agreeing to continue fighting terrorism. There are concerns in Washington that Islamabad may shift away from militarized efforts against Islamist militants. Prime Minister Gillani of Pakistan prioritizes combating terrorism and extremism, along with addressing poverty and unemployment. Foreign Minister Qureshi emphasizes political engagement over negotiations with terrorists. The ANP-led government in the North West Frontier Province may resist militarized approaches favored by the U.S. The ANP is expected to lead negotiations with militant groups, while Gillani aims to open dialogue with religious extremists who disarm. The new NWFP Chief Minister, ANP figure Amir Haider Khan Hoti, believes that the issue of extremism cannot be resolved by only engaging with tribal elders but must also involve the militants themselves. Hoti demands an end to US missile attacks on Pakistani territory and calls for military action against extremists as a last resort. The ANP asserts that the Pakistan army is not involved in the conflict in the tribal areas and will not participate in negotiations."
