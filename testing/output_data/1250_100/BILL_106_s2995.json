    "content": "The \"Community Character Act of 2000\" emphasizes the importance of comprehensive land use planning at the State level to prevent increased costs for infrastructure development, loss of community character, and environmental degradation. It recognizes the need for updated legislation to support planning efforts and coordination between State and local governments. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal land management agency,\" \"land use planning legislation,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"State planning director.\" The director is the State official responsible for drafting and updating State guide plans regulating land use and infrastructure development statewide. Grants will be provided to states for updating land use planning legislation and integrating federal land management with state planning. The Secretary will establish a grant program to assist states in developing or revising land use planning legislation and creating or updating state comprehensive land use plans. States must demonstrate citizen representation and multijurisdictional cooperation in their land use planning reform goals to be eligible for grants. Land use plans are created based on multi-jurisdictional governmental cooperation, particularly in the case of plans based on watershed boundaries. Implementation elements include a timetable for action, roles and responsibilities definition, consistency with State capital budget objectives, and decision framework for future infrastructure development. Comprehensive planning encourages sustainable economic development, social equity, community character enhancement, and coordination of transportation, housing, and education. Land use plans are routinely updated and reflect professional planning standards. Grant funds can be used for technical assistance in drafting legislation, research, workshops, and integrating State concerns with Federal plans. Grants to States shall not exceed $500,000. The Federal share of project funding under subsection (a) is capped at 90 percent. The Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development will conduct audits to ensure grant funds are used as intended. $25,000,000 is authorized for appropriations from 2001 to 2005 for this section. Federal land management agencies must designate a coordinator to work with State planning directors on funded projects. They are required to provide necessary information to State planning directors and participate in community events as requested."
