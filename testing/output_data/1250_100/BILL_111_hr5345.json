    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Consumer Auto Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. Congress acknowledges the benefits of event data recorders for vehicle safety, including automatic crash notification systems and understanding crashworthiness. With over 38,000 annual road fatalities in the US, utilizing event data recorders could significantly reduce deaths. The inclusion of these recorders in new vehicles is deemed crucial for enhancing safety, outweighing any financial burden on manufacturers. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends installing event data recorders on light passenger vehicles, schoolbuses, and motorcoaches to enhance safety. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends installing event data recorders on light passenger vehicles, schoolbuses, and motorcoaches to enhance safety. SEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS. The Secretary of Transportation will require motor vehicle manufacturers to equip all vehicles of model year 2012 or later with event data recorders meeting specific specifications and establishing a uniform data retrieval method. The Secretary will require motor vehicles to have event data recorders that can withstand specific crash tests and temperature conditions, without losing data or function. The event data recorder mandated by the Secretary must record various data elements including yaw data, safety belt status, vehicle speed, engine rotations, acceleration changes, airbag deployment details, rollover data, ABS operation, and vehicle identification information. The event data recorder required by the Secretary must record various data elements including tire pressure, crash-related data for at least 60 seconds before and 15 seconds after the crash event, and other data deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The event data recorder required by the Secretary must have tamper resistance and be compatible with a universal data retrieval method established by the Secretary. The universal data retrieval method must allow data from any motor vehicle to be retrieved and put into readable form. The Secretary will establish a process for transmitting data from event data recorders and create a database for research and analysis. Periodic evaluations will be conducted to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The Secretary will establish a database containing data from event data recorders, including relevant information from other sources for research and analysis. The data will be available to the public, with necessary safeguards for personally identifiable information. The Secretary will ensure that publicly available data from event data recorders do not contain personally identifiable information to protect individual privacy. The term 'event data recorder' is defined in section 563.5(b) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary of Transportation will promulgate a rule requiring motor vehicle manufacturers to ensure that data recorded by event data recorders in vehicles prior to model year 2012 can be read by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This rule applies to vehicles equipped with event data recorders, but does not mandate all vehicles to have them. The data must be accessible to NHTSA representatives with physical access to the vehicle using a computer. The rule requires vehicle manufacturers to ensure that event data recorder data can be accessed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for safety analysis. The data is owned by the vehicle owner or lessee, and access is restricted to them unless authorized by a court. The data from event data recorders in motor vehicles can be retrieved under certain conditions: court authorization for legal proceedings, owner or lessee consent for diagnosis or repair, or by a government safety agency for improving vehicle safety without disclosing personal information. SEC. 4. REPORT ON FEASIBILITY OF AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION OF EDR DATA. Event data recorders required for model year 2012 or later, readability of data in event data recorders prior to model year 2012, and privacy of data in event data recorders are addressed in this section. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment on the feasibility of requiring motor vehicles with event data recorders to automatically transmit crash data to the Secretary. The report will analyze the systems for automatic data transmission, benefits of maintaining a database, and the cost to manufacturers. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress within 180 days on the feasibility of requiring motor vehicles with event data recorders to automatically transmit crash data. The report will include an analysis of compliance costs for manufacturers, a recommended timeline for compliance, and an assessment of privacy issues with recommendations for addressing them."
