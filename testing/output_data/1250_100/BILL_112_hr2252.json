    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to self-defense. The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their duty is to the public at large. Examples include a case where only 200,000 out of 700,000 calls for help were responded to by police in Dade County. The Department of Justice found 168,881 violent crimes in 1989. In 1989, 168,881 violent crimes were not responded to by police within 1 hour. Each year, over 2,400,000 people in the US use firearms for self-defense, with 92% only brandishing or firing a warning shot. In 2001, two brothers used firearms to defend their lives and business from burglars in Reisterstown, Maryland. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges against them after they shot and killed one burglar and injured two others. The injured men were charged with burglary, and two others were charged in connection with previous burglaries at the brothers' warehouse. In 2008, a store clerk in Waukegan, Illinois, faced potential criminal charges for shooting a robber in self-defense without a firearm owner's identification card. Illinois law only allows individuals with ownership or proprietary interest to carry a gun in a place of business. In 2004, a homeowner in Wilmette, Illinois, was charged and convicted for owning handguns and violating a handgun ban ordinance after shooting a home intruder. The resident had a loaded firearm as a backup plan for home defense. The homeowner in Wilmette, Illinois, confronted and shot an intruder who entered the house twice. The intruder stole a car to go to the hospital and was charged with burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. Courts grant immunity to police officers using firearms, and law-abiding citizens should not face lawsuits for defending themselves with firearms. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed for individuals not prohibited from owning firearms. This includes using firearms in self-defense against perceived threats or violent felonies, as well as defending one's home during the commission of a felony by another person. The right to obtain firearms for self-defense is reaffirmed. Individuals can take legal action for damages if this right is violated, with a statute of limitations of 5 years from the discovery of the violation. The court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing plaintiff."
