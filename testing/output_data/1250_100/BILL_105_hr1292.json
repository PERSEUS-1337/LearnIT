    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Voluntary Alcohol Advertising Standards for Children Act\". The Congress finds that television advertising influences children's perception of societal values and behavior, especially regarding alcohol. Children are exposed to a significant amount of television each week, with alcohol producers spending millions on advertising, often targeting underage audiences with themes like humor and sports. The current advertising codes of brewers and distillers are inadequate to restrain most of the messages reaching young people, teaching them to drink. These codes are unenforceable, lack uniformity, and subject young people to continuous inducements to drink. Broadcast networks and stations have standards for alcohol advertising, but they do not apply to all broadcasters or shield underage audiences. Alcohol producers claim not to target underage persons, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. Enforceable voluntary broadcast standards for alcohol advertising can protect children from underage targeting while allowing alcohol producers to promote to adult consumers. This approach is minimally restrictive and aligns with business missions and social responsibility. SEC. 337 of the Communications Act of 1934 establishes and implements television advertising codes. The Commission shall prescribe a code of conduct for alcoholic beverage advertisements in video programming to limit exposure to minors. An advisory committee will be established with diverse representation to provide recommendations on content, frequency, timing, and placement of ads. The antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the television industry to create a voluntary code limiting minors' exposure to alcohol ads. This exemption is limited to a one-year period and does not allow for boycotts. Enforcement of advertising codes established under this section will be considered a regulation by the Commission. The requirement for the Commission to prescribe a code will take effect after one year if the television industry fails to establish a voluntary code limiting minors' exposure to alcohol ads that is acceptable to the Commission. The Commission will assess the implementation and compliance of video programming codes in its annual reports. Definitions for terms like 'antitrust laws' and 'person in the television industry' are provided in this section. The term 'video programming' is defined in section 602 of this Act and includes content from various organizations and individuals in the television industry."
