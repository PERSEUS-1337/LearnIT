    "content": "A Retrospective of House Rules Changes Since the 110th Congress examines how the majority party in the House organizes and writes the chamber's rules at the beginning of each new Congress. While the House largely adopts previous rules, changes are also made. The report is part of a series that analyzes rules changes in the House over multiple Congresses. The report analyzes changes in House rules resolutions from the 110th to the 115th Congresses, focusing on committees, chamber and floor procedures, budget legislation, House administration, and ethics standards. It also covers the Democratic critique of Republican management and Republican critique of Democratic management during these Congresses. The report analyzes changes in House rules resolutions from the 110th to the 115th Congresses, focusing on committees, chamber and floor procedures, budget legislation, House administration, and ethics standards. It also covers the critique by Democrats of Republican management and Republican critique of Democratic management during these Congresses. The report further organizes changes made in the rules resolutions into five broad subject areas and explains the changes in language that is more easily understood. The report details changes in House rules resolutions from the 110th to the 115th Congresses, focusing on committees, chamber and floor procedures, budget legislation, House administration, and ethics standards. It categorizes the changes into major headings and explains them in a more easily understood language. The House Rules and Manual contains provisions of House rules, with notes on changes and decisions. It catalogs changes made at the convening of a new House, focusing on rules resolutions and Speaker's policies. The Speaker's policies interpret and implement House rules, including changes made through resolutions, orders, and legislation. Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference rules also impact House procedures. The House adopts special rules and agreements to adapt its procedures for considering measures. Committees' names were changed between the 110th and 115th Congresses. Democrats criticized Republicans' management of the House on ethics and legislative issues. In the 104th to 106th Congresses, Democrats proposed rules changes related to gift regulations, copyright royalty income limits, and ethics committee deliberation time limits. Republicans set end dates for ethics committee deliberations and Democrats aimed to restrict member interventions in hiring based on political affiliation and threats based on political contributions. The Republican rules package for the 108th Congress included changes to ethics rules, allowing limited income from medical practice, gifts of perishable food to House offices, and exempting charity travel from gift rules. In the 109th Congress, further changes to the Standards of Official Conduct Committee procedures were criticized by Democrats as lowering ethical standards. In the 109th Congress, Democrats criticized Republican changes to ethics rules, arguing they weakened the ethics committee and allowed indicted Members to hold leadership positions. Democrats also objected to rules dismissing ethics complaints after 45 days and prohibiting Members from negotiating employment with those with legislative interests. The House reinstated previous ethics rules in April 2005, and Democrats proposed further changes to ethics standards during the 109th Congress. In June 2006, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi proposed changes to ethics standards, including banning gifts from lobbyists, doubling the cooling-off period for lobbying, requiring disclosure of campaign contributions, prohibiting Members from influencing hiring decisions, and ensuring transparency in conference committee meetings. In December 2005, Democratic Representatives introduced a House rules reform package with provisions related to ethics standards, including restrictions on accepting travel from lobbyists, requirements for former Members on the House floor, and prohibiting earmark requests. The Democrats proposed various changes to House rules resolutions in multiple Congresses, including requirements for party ratios on committees, changes in legislation consideration with budgetary impact, and amendments related to tax legislation and appropriations bills. In various Congresses, Democrats proposed changes to House rules resolutions, including pay-as-you-go rules, amendments related to tax legislation, and restrictions on appropriations bills. Their amendments aimed to eliminate procedural changes and strengthen the majority leader's authority in the amendment process. The Democrats proposed amendments in various Congresses to change House rules resolutions, including granting voting rights to the Delegate from the District of Columbia and reformulating legislation drafting procedures. They also sought to strike changes to House rules in the Republicans' rules resolution, addressing issues such as postponing certain votes and extending the days for motions to suspend the rules. In the 109th Congress, Democrats addressed transparency issues in the legislative process by proposing a two-thirds vote requirement on special rules to waive the three-day layover of a measure or conference report. They also considered legislative continuity in catastrophic circumstances following the events of September 11, 2001. In the 109th Congress, Democrats proposed changes to legislative management, including a two-thirds vote requirement on special rules and addressing legislative continuity in catastrophic circumstances. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi introduced \"New House Principles\" and \"New Direction for America\" with proposals for regular consultations between party leaders on scheduling and operations. In the 109th Congress, Democrats proposed changes to legislative management, emphasizing the need for regular order and transparency in the House's consideration of legislation. This included calls for bills to be developed following full hearings and open markups, with Members given at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level. The Minority should control at least one-third of committee budgets and office space to ensure fair representation. Regular meetings between Chairs and Ranking Members of committees and staffs were also recommended to facilitate efficient legislative processes. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day. Floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes, with no vote held open to manipulate the outcome. House-Senate conference committees should hold regular meetings of all members, with ample opportunity for input and debate. The Suspension Calendar should be restricted to non-controversial legislation, with minority-authored bills scheduled in relation to party ratio. In the 109th Congress, minority-authored legislation is scheduled in relation to the party ratio in the House. The House Rules Committee minority staff presented recommendations to restore deliberative democracy in the U.S. House of Representatives. The \"Broken Promises\" report criticized special rules used in the House, recommending more serious amendments, bills under open rules, and less use of suspension bills. The Republican leadership should expand debate time and amendments on bills under special rules, restrict suspensions to Mondays and Tuesdays, end the practice of granting blanket waivers to conference reports, and restore transparency, accountability, and oversight in House rules. Representative Slaughter and other Democratic members introduced a resolution to address these issues. The curr_chunk discusses various proposed changes to House rules, including prohibiting certain procedures, requiring roll-call votes on conference reports, changing layover rules, publishing voting records, limiting consideration under suspension of rules, repealing the Gephardt rule, allowing minority amendments, and requiring 24-hour notice. The House rules reform package introduced by Democratic Representatives in 2005 included provisions such as limiting roll-call votes to 20 minutes, allowing committee members to offer preferential amendments, requiring 24-hour notice for special rule alterations, and ensuring printed copies of measures are available before consideration.

Congressional procedures and practices were also an issue in the 2008 presidential campaign, with Senator Barack Obama addressing the topic in Green Bay, WI on September 22, 2008. Key points included requirements for open conference meetings, restrictions on budget deficit increases, and limitations on adjourning sine die without sufficient legislative activity. Senator Barack Obama addressed reform issues in Green Bay, WI on September 22, 2008, emphasizing transparency in Congress. He pledged to make meetings where laws are written more open to the public and provide a five-day review period for bills before signing. Obama also promised to disclose corporate tax breaks and pork-barrel projects online for public scrutiny. Presidential candidate Senator John McCain also focused on congressional earmarks in the 2008 campaign. In the 2008 campaign, Senator John McCain made congressional earmarks an issue and proposed their elimination. Democratic control of the House in the early 21st century was brief compared to previous years, with Republicans critiquing Democratic leadership patterns. In the 110th Congress, Republicans tried to change House rules through procedural means. In the 111th Congress, Republicans sought to preserve changes made in House rules during their majority, including disallowing special rules on appropriations and tax measures. They critiqued the majority leadership for limiting Member input on the House floor. Republicans criticized the Democratic majority in the Rules Committee for rewriting major legislation, excluding opposing viewpoints, and bypassing regular legislative processes to push a partisan agenda. They also condemned the Democrats for ending open amendment processes for general appropriation bills, triggering further criticism of their legislative management of the House. Republicans criticized the Democratic majority for bypassing regular legislative processes and excluding opposing viewpoints in the management of the House. Both parties introduced resolutions to increase transparency and adherence to regular order. Republican leaders proposed a return to regular order for legislation development, including more floor debate and amendments under an open rule. Leader Boehner and Republican Whip Eric Cantor emphasized the importance of committee work and transparency in congressional proceedings. Boehner highlighted the need for legislators, not just voters, to be involved in committee work, while Cantor stressed the significance of setting aside dedicated time for committees to conduct their business without interruptions. Boehner also shared his experience implementing transparency rules in committee proceedings during his time as a committee chair. The 2010 elections led to a change in majority in the House for the 112th Congress. Democrats proposed an amendment to the Republican rules package, aiming to overturn a provision exempting certain tax laws from the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act. The amendment was argued to undermine existing rules limiting mandatory spending and tax breaks that contribute to deficits. The proposed rule changes in the 113th Congress aim to eliminate limitations on adding to the deficit through special interest tax breaks. A motion to require Members to decide on participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program within 15 days was defeated. The House voted to table a motion to study the constitutionality of deleting Delegates' voting rights. Unlike previous Congresses, Democrats responded to Republican rules with proposed amendments in the 113th Congress. In the 113th Congress, Democrats proposed amendments to the rules package related to different policy stances of the two parties. Representative Slaughter urged defeating a motion to allow an amendment on a joint resolution to overturn the Citizens United decision and limit political contributions. She highlighted the influence of unlimited money from billionaires and special interests in elections. The Democrats proposed amendments to remove unlimited political donations from elections and promote early voting opportunities. The motion to commit the House rules resolution with the amendment was rejected, and the rules resolution was agreed to. Earlier, a motion to refer the resolution to a select committee to study the denial of Delegates' voting rights was tabled. In the 114th Congress, Democrats responded to the Republican rules package by proposing amendments related to different policy stances. The Democratic floor manager urged the House to defeat the previous question motion to propose an amendment for infrastructure spending by closing tax loopholes for companies moving overseas. The amendment aimed to raise $33.6 billion for roads, railways, and bridges. Democratic Members spoke about the proposed amendment during the rules debate. During the rules debate, Democratic Members proposed economic policy legislation for the 114th Congress, including the CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act. The motion to commit the House rules resolution with an amendment limiting corporate deductions for executive compensation was rejected. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton's motion to refer the resolution to a select committee to study Delegates' voting rights was tabled. Democrats had consistently criticized the number of closed and structured special rules in previous Congresses under Republican majority. During the rules debate, Democratic Members consistently complained about closed special rules and specific Democratic amendments not considered. Ranking Minority Member Louise Slaughter criticized the lack of regular order and urged for more public policy consideration. Democrats opposed three rules changes, including fines for breaching decorum with electronic devices. The Republican majority included these changes in response. The Republican majority made changes to House rules in response to Democratic Members' 25-hour \"sit-in\" demanding votes on anti-gun violence legislation. Democratic Members argued that the changes were unconstitutional and limited their rights to debate. Representative John Lewis's motion to strike the changes was rejected. Another controversial change was a standing order in the House rules resolution. The standing order in the 115th Congress rules resolution included an exemption affecting legislation to repeal or reform the Affordable Care Act. Democrats criticized the exemption, arguing it would impact the federal deficit, health coverage, premiums, Medicare recipients, and Medicare's solvency. Ranking Member Slaughter planned to offer an amendment to the rules resolution to address these concerns. The House ordered the previous question, preventing an amendment that would establish a point of order against legislation undoing the Affordable Care Act. The rules resolution reintroduced the Holman Rule, allowing cuts to federal employees' pay, which Democrats criticized as circumventing the legislative process. The House adopted rules resolution allowing cuts to federal employees' pay, sparking debate. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton's motion to refer the resolution to a select committee was tabled. Changes to committee system in various Congresses were outlined, focusing on structure, procedure, and staff. The 110th to 115th Congresses were organized by Democrats and Republicans, with changes in the size and composition of the Intelligence Committee. Rules were amended regarding committee chair term limits and member composition. The standing committee chair term limit was set to three consecutive Congresses, with an exemption for the Rules Committee chair. A Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming was created in the 110th Congress to address energy dependence and climate change. The select committee continued into the 111th Congress, along with the House Democracy Assistance Commission and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. The authority of the Lantos Human Rights Commission was expanded for the 111th Congress to collaborate with other relevant committees and use House resources. The Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) was continued to review misconduct allegations and refer recommendations to the Standards of Official Conduct Committee. The House Democracy Assistance Commission was renamed to the House Democracy Partnership in the 112th Congress. The House Democracy Partnership and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission were continued in the 113th and 114th Congress with modifications. The Office of Congressional Ethics also continued with authority to hire consultants. In the 114th Congress, provisions related to term limits for board members were made inoperative. An individual subject to review must be informed of the right to counsel, and the Office of Congressional Ethics cannot deny constitutional rights. The Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi was allowed to adopt a rule for questioning witnesses. Additionally, a Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies was created for the 2017 inauguration.

It also added jurisdiction over new budget authority related to loans to the Appropriations Committee. The rules resolution amended Rule X to give the House Administration Committee jurisdiction over the policy direction of the chief administrative officer. It also allowed for the creation of a Select Intelligence Oversight Panel and authorized certain committees to have more subcommittees than permitted by House rules. In the 111th to 115th Congresses, various separate orders in H.Res. 5 allowed Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, and Transportation and Infrastructure to have specific numbers of subcommittees, with adjustments made in each Congress.

It also allowed the chair of a committee to request the Government Accountability Office to analyze if a new federal program duplicates an existing one. The committee's report on a bill had to indicate if it established a duplicative program. In the 114th Congress, H.Res. 5 included a separate order requiring committee reports to explain if a program established or reauthorized in a measure is duplicative of another federal program, similar to the rules resolution for the 115th Congress. The rule change did not include language related to requests for GAO analyses.

In the 110th Congress, a rule change defined earmarks, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits. Earmarks were provisions targeting specific entities, while limited benefits applied to 10 or fewer entities. Members had to request these benefits in writing to committees, which were required to retain the requests. Committees also had to establish regular meeting days. In the 113th Congress, H.Res. 5 changed the rules for committee meetings, requiring notice for meetings to be held only if there is notice as provided for in House Rule XI. It also required notices of meetings held at the initiative of a majority of the committee to be posted electronically.

In the 113th Congress, rules resolution added subjects for committees to include in oversight plans, covering cutting or eliminating inefficient programs. H.Res. 5 changed the submission deadline for committee activity reports to January 2 each year, reducing the frequency to twice per Congress. In the 114th Congress, committee activity reports returned to a once-a-Congress schedule. The rules resolution in the 115th Congress amended the requirement for committees to adopt oversight plans, now also including authorization plans. Committees must adopt their plans by February 15 in the first session of Congress in an open meeting. Plans must be submitted to various committees, including the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Appropriations Committee.

The amended rule in the 115th Congress exempted certain committees from adopting authorization and oversight plans. The changes included directing committees to include specific details in their plans, such as programs with lapsed authorizations, programs not reviewed in previous Congresses, and descriptions of programs to be authorized in current and future Congresses. Recommendations for changes to existing laws were also required. The rule amendment in the 115th Congress exempted some committees from adopting authorization and oversight plans.

In the 113th Congress, a separate order authorized the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to continue a lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder for not complying with subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious investigation. The order sought to provide continuity for enforcing a subpoena that expired at the end of the 112th Congress. It authorized the committee chair to initiate judicial proceedings to enforce subpoenas issued in the 112th Congress and allowed the chair to issue subpoenas pending the adoption of the committee's rules for the 113th Congress. In the 114th Congress, a separate order repeated the text from the previous Congress and updated it to include references to the 113th Congress.

The use of special rules in House proceedings has been a point of contention between the minority and majority parties. The type of special rule used is determined by the majority's preferences, not standing House rules. Rules changes in the 110th to 115th Congresses have aimed to improve House proceedings by addressing issues such as admission to the chamber, earmarks, and voting. Speaker John A. Boehner resigned during the 114th Congress, leading to the election of a new Speaker.

En bloc amendments transferring appropriations to the account were allowed, but amendments proposing a net increase in budget authority were not permitted unless offset by equal decreases. The point of order against changes in existing law in appropriations bills did not apply to the spending reduction account. The House rules were amended to delay consideration of general appropriation bills, restrict amendments proposing a net increase in budget authority, and reinstate the Holman rule allowing for spending reductions in appropriations bills. The House rules were amended to allow legislative text in appropriations bills to reduce spending by cutting money, federal employee salaries, or compensation from the U.S. treasury. In previous Congresses, bills proposing law changes had to include a citation to the United States Code. In the 112th Congress, H.Res. 5 required bills to be accompanied by a statement citing constitutional authority. The chair of the committee could submit this statement for Senate bills. In the 114th Congress, a separate order addressed state legislatures' memorials for a constitutional convention. States can request a \"Convention for proposing Amendments\" to the Constitution. In the 115th Congress, H.Res. 5 continued the separate order from the 114th Congress regarding state legislatures' memorials for a constitutional convention. The Judiciary Committee chair must determine if the memorial is an application and designate it for public availability.

Changes included modernizing practices related to the Union Calendar and shifting the referral of claims to the Private Calendar.

The conference rules prohibited scheduling bills or resolutions that commend or celebrate entities, events, individuals, or government programs. H.Res. 6 in the 110th Congress amended rules for open conference meetings and required House conferees to have notice of meetings and provisions in disagreement to be open for discussion.

The House rules were amended to require conferees to be provided with a complete copy of the conference agreement at one place and time to sign or not sign. Additionally, a new provision stated that the House could not consider a conference report if the conference text varied from the conferees' action on differences between the two Houses. The House also amended rules to require the joint explanatory statement of a conference report to list all earmarks, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits.

Most standing rules remained unchanged when party majorities shifted. In the new millennium, House rules evolved to accommodate diverse perspectives within party majorities and empower the minority.

In the House, committees passed measures that couldn't pass the Senate, leading to less conference convening. The motion to recommit was used for messaging and alternatives. Majority leadership gained more control over committee agendas and legislation drafting. Party leaders now control committee selection, as there is less political overlap between parties.

The role of Congress is to winnow proposals for laws, considering factors like public support and cost. Rules changes in the 116th Congress are expected to be incremental, balancing majority control with minority prerogatives. The House majority party must also consider Senate control when proposing rules changes. The House majority party is contemplating a rules package and party arrangements, reflecting on the effectiveness of the President and Congress over the past 30 years. Presidents have experienced different party arrangements during their terms, with successes and failures in major policy initiatives. Both parties in the House have focused on party rules in recent Congresses to open up to more voices and perspectives. In recent Congresses, both the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference have organized under different banners to open up to more voices and perspectives in party decisionmaking. Speaker Thomas Bracken Reed's rulings created the modern majority-minority House, but the impact of strong Speakers like Joseph Cannon was unforeseen. The Corrections Calendar, created in 1995, was terminated in the rules package for the 109th Congress. The rules package for the 109th Congress terminated the Corrections Calendar, which was created in 1995. The consideration of legislation under suspension of the rules has become a more frequent procedure in the House, with motions allowed on various days of House sessions. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974's requirement for two budget resolutions each year was impractical and time-consuming, leading to its abandonment. House rules are crucial for governance and are meant to be utilized by all Members and party majorities and minorities."
