    "content": "Many observers criticized the United Nations for leaving Timor-Leste prematurely in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta called for the UN to stay for five more years in 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. A failed assassination attempt on the president and prime minister in 2008 by a group led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was later killed. Despite improvements in security, concerns remain about implementing reforms following the 2006 mutiny. The Timor-Leste government has yet to address the underlying causes of the 2006 mutiny by security forces. A joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission report blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on after the report. Concerns also arise from government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, offering assistance with construction and selling power plants and patrol boats. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, covering housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and local development. The last IDP camps were closed in June 2009, with support needed for decommissioning and returning persons. East Timor's history includes Portuguese colonial control until 1975, followed by Indonesian invasion and occupation. Indonesia's annexation was not recognized by the UN, leading to a period of conflict and significant loss of life. In 1999, East Timor held a referendum for independence from Indonesia, resulting in widespread violence and destruction by pro-Indonesian militias. More than 1,300 East Timorese were killed, and many were displaced. A U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission was deployed to restore order. Australia has played a significant role in U.N. operations and bilateral relations with East Timor since then. Jose Ramos-Horta is the president of East Timor. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste, was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1996 for his work to promote the cause of Timor-Leste. He was appointed president in 2006 after the resignation of Mari Alkatiri. Ramos-Horta was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 2008. Xanana Gusmao, the current prime minister, was a resistance leader against Indonesian occupation and became Timor-Leste's first president. Gusmao was captured by Indonesian forces in 1992 and released in 1999. Xanana Gusmao became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002 after being released by President B.J. Habibie in 1999. He later stepped down to become prime minister in 2007 through a coalition with smaller parties. Gusmao survived an assassination attempt in 2008 by Reinado forces, who caused insecurity in 2006. Mari Alkatiri, a former prime minister, resigned in 2006 amid unrest and remains Secretary General of Fretilin. Alkatiri, a Muslim minority in Timor-Leste, has a hostile relationship with Gusmao. Fretilin opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. Timor-Leste has a unicameral parliament of 65 members elected in 2007. The parliament in East Timor was established in 2002 after gaining independence from Indonesia. The parliament consists of 52 to 65 members and is led by the Fretilin party. Xanana Gusmao became the Prime Minister in 2007 through a coalition government. The coalition, known as the Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority, includes four parties. The main opposition party in East Timor is Fretilin. The parliament faces challenges with members lacking legislative experience and education. The use of two legal languages hampers parliamentary business. Elections in 2007 led to Ramos-Horta becoming president and Gusmao becoming prime minister. Fretilin won the most seats but did not have a majority, leading to protests. Prior to the 2007 elections, East Timor held an election in 2001. In 2001, East Timor held an election supervised by UNTAET to elect a constituent assembly. In 2002, Gusmao won the Presidential election with 86% voter turnout. Events in 2006 led to the deployment of foreign peacekeepers, including Australian troops. UNMIT was established to support stability in East Timor. The 2006 strife in East Timor stemmed from divisions within the Fretilin party dating back to their struggle against the Indonesians. This led to splits within the military and police forces, with many military recruits being loyal to Xanana Gusmao. The recruitment process also caused tensions between the military and police, with over 300 former Indonesian police officers hired into the new East Timor police force. The 2006 political turmoil in East Timor was triggered by the dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri, leading to rioting, looting, and factionalism within the police force. The conflict highlighted tensions between the eastern and western districts of East Timor, with the military leadership mainly from the east and the political leadership from the west. The 2006 political turmoil in East Timor led to deaths and mass exodus from the capital, Dili. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri resigned amid accusations of forming \"hit squads.\" Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced for authorizing weapon transfers. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader in the protests, escaped from prison with supporters. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado in 2007. The decision to apprehend Reinado was made after he convinced a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. Reinado, not a major political figure in East Timor, had support among young men resentful of foreign military presence. Gang violence, fueled by high unemployment rates, swept through Dili after the 2006 clashes, leading to deaths and property destruction. Many Dili gangs viewed Reinado positively, contributing to the instability in East Timor. The security situation in East Timor since April 2006 has affected the livelihoods of the population, with 100,000 people remaining displaced by February 2007. Lack of access to water, poor sanitation, and risk of disease were significant issues for internally displaced persons. More than 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, leading to high child mortality rates and food shortages. Social structures and services deteriorated, impacting healthcare, education, and disaster response capabilities. The transition from humanitarian programs to development activities in East Timor remains a challenge due to extreme poverty levels. Funding has increased during times of insecurity and displacement, with the UN providing emergency assistance and generating a Flash Appeal in response to renewed violence in 2006. Security incidents in 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, raising concerns about access and the safety of displaced individuals and organizations providing assistance. The violent demonstrations in East Timor prompted contingency planning under the National Disaster Management Office and Ministry of Labour. The international humanitarian aid community, including the U.N. and other organizations, provided assistance to those affected. By April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery packages and the government began to decommission some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with assistance from organizations like the International Organization for Migration. In November 2008, roughly 10,400 families had received recovery packages and returned, and approximately 21 camps had closed. Approximately 10,400 families have returned and 21 camps have closed in East Timor. Transitional shelter sites are housing some displaced individuals. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remains a challenge for returning IDPs. Food security deteriorated in 2008 due to high food prices, shortages, lack of arable land, and natural disasters. Land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence hinder the reintegration of IDPs. The return process has been relatively peaceful, but sustainability and durable solutions are needed according to U.N. Representative Walter Kalin. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) ended its mission in East Timor in December 2008. The U.N. Security Council established the U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) in August 2006 to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues. The mission includes civilian, police, and military personnel to support the electoral process. The mandate was extended until February 2008, with temporary police reinforcement for national elections. Cooperation with the International Security Force (ISF) is also emphasized. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) until February 26, 2010, with Resolution 1867 (2009). East Timor has seen improvements since 2006 but still faces challenges like reintegration of IDPs, poverty, and high unemployment. The Secretary General emphasized the need for long-term commitment for stability, development, and democratic governance. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) until February 26, 2010, with Resolution 1867 (2009). The Secretary General's report in early January 2009 focused on political and security developments, promoting human rights, administration of justice, socio-economic development, and humanitarian assistance in Timor-Leste. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor have evolved since 1999, with various resolutions authorizing missions like UNAMET and INTERFET. The focus has been on improving human resource capacity, ongoing humanitarian activities, and implementing the National Recovery Strategy program. The preparation of a medium-term strategy for East Timor is also underway. The Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established in 1999 to administer the region during its transition to independence. UNTAET's mandate included providing humanitarian aid, assisting in government establishment, and aiding East Timorese refugees in West Timor. A successor mission, UNMISET, was established in 2002 and extended until 2005. The United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) was established in 2005 with a mandate to support state institutions, strengthen democratic governance, and develop a national police force. Activities included training national judges and finance sector experts. Special Representative Hasegawa highlighted progress in implementing programs and preparing for capacity building support functions. Progress has been made in the finance sector in Timor-Leste, with advancements in democratic governance and human rights. However, concerns were raised about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance, unresolved human rights issues, and the need for additional training for the Border Patrol Unit. Despite accomplishments, the situation was described as \"fragile\" by Mr. Hasegawa, emphasizing the importance of stability and peace. The situation in East Timor was described as \"fragile\" by Mr. Hasegawa, emphasizing the need for stability and peace. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times due to escalating violence in 2006, with the goal of providing humanitarian assistance and supporting economic and political development. The United States also provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for building a self-sufficient economy, improving public services, and promoting good governance. The U.S. has supported East Timor's economic and political development through various initiatives, including assistance to independent media, civil society organizations, and political parties. Experts believe that sustained bilateral, multilateral, and regional support is still needed. The U.S. government provides non-food humanitarian assistance through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to respond quickly to international crises and disasters. OFDA works with implementing partners such as U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations to deliver relief materials and personnel. In East Timor, the United States provides humanitarian assistance through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the Food for Peace Program (FFP). OFDA funds implementing partners for tasks like humanitarian coordination, shelter, water, and peacebuilding. In FY2008, OFDA provided $1.2 million, FFP contributed $1.1 million, and the Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) provided $0.8 million for a total of $3.1 million in USAID humanitarian assistance to East Timor. In 2005, supporters argued that East Timor was not ready for the U.N. departure due to fragile state institutions. Events in 2006 proved this correct, highlighting the need to improve security services, judiciary, transparency, and rule of law. U.S. relations with East Timor are linked to Indonesia, with Congress concerned about past human rights abuses. East Timor aims for a productive relationship with Indonesia despite the vast population difference. The Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act of 2009 includes Timor-Leste as an eligible state for preferential tariff treatment. Timor-Leste's main external relations are with Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Indonesia, and China. Australia and New Zealand have been key providers of peacekeeping troops in Timor-Leste since 1999. Australia has 650 soldiers in Timor-Leste as part of the International Stabilization Force (ISF) alongside troops from New Zealand. They also have police working with 20 other countries for security in Dili. Australia has historical ties to Timor, including fighting Japanese forces in WWII and economic interests in hydrocarbon resources. They recognized Indonesian control of the province in a treaty in 1989. The Timor Sea Treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste replaced a previous agreement in 1991. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, both countries work together on hydrocarbon development. Timor-Leste prefers a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin. Commercial concerns and political security favor Darwin. Key players in the Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a strong relationship with Portugal, resulting in a predominantly Catholic population. Portugal remains a key provider of foreign assistance to Timor-Leste, with a strong relationship resulting in a predominantly Catholic population. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste in 1975 after the departure of the Portuguese, leading to a guerilla movement and significant loss of life. The Indonesian military destroyed infrastructure and killed additional Timorese following a 1999 referendum for independence. Relations have improved since 2004, with Indonesia seeking positive relations with Timor-Leste. President Ramos-Horta of Timor-Leste has urged the nation to move forward and accept that those responsible for the 1999 atrocities will never be brought to trial. A truth commission found that the Indonesian army supported militias involved in crimes. Former Indonesian General Wiranto, linked to human rights abuses in East Timor, ran for vice president in 2009. China has been increasing its investment in Timor-Leste since 2005 for various strategic reasons, including countering U.S. influence and accessing resources. This rise of Chinese influence may raise concerns for strategic planners. China's increasing influence in Timor-Leste, including high-profile projects and arms sales, has raised concerns for Australian strategic planners. Timor's support for a One-China policy and plans to join ASEAN have strengthened bilateral relations. Criticism arose over a proposal to purchase oil burning power stations from China, with concerns about pollution and the need for imported fuel. Fretilin is preparing a legal challenge against the purchase. East Timor's extensive off-shore energy resources can provide necessary financial resources for development. Disagreements with Australia over maritime boundaries have been set aside with revenue sharing agreements. In 2005-2006, East Timor earned an estimated $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues. Greater Sunrise in East Timor is estimated to contain 300 million barrels of light oil and 2.53 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Industry favors Darwin over East Timor for processing centers due to seabed configuration and lack of infrastructure. ConocoPhillips built a new LNG plant near Darwin, while Timor-Leste prefers a plant on its southern coast. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to deplete by 2023. East Timor earned $3.2-5 billion in energy revenues since 2005, mostly placed in a Petroleum Fund. Top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. East Timor is the poorest country in Asia with a dual economy. The violence in 1999 devastated infrastructure, leading to widespread poverty and lack of basic amenities. International support is needed for job creation, infrastructure development, and improved health and literacy rates. Language barriers exist, with Indonesian being more widely used than Tetun or Portuguese. Economic development is crucial for improving living standards. External assistance will remain critical post-independence, especially for governance capacity building. East Timor faces economic challenges such as capacity building in governance, revenue from oil and gas, coffee production, tourism potential, and fisheries. The UNDAF provides a roadmap for UN agencies. Other challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, education and training, rule of law implementation, and infrastructure rebuilding. East Timor is a member of the World Bank and IMF, and has shown interest in ASEAN membership. International dissatisfaction arose from Indonesia's handling of crimes following the 1999 independence referendum. The United States expressed dissatisfaction with the Indonesian tribunal outcome and supported the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) of UNMISET. President Gusmao endorsed a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities. Public hearings were held in Bali in February 2007 to address the crimes associated with the 1999 referendum. Gusmao has faced criticism for not holding Indonesia accountable for documented atrocities in 1999. The 2005 report on human rights abuses in Timor-Leste highlighted serious issues such as police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and inadequate judiciary. Concerns were raised about the readiness for a U.N. departure in 2006 due to problems with discipline and accountability in the National Police and Defense Forces. The U.N. argued that East Timor was not ready for a U.N. departure as state institutions were fragile. East Timor requested continued U.N. presence for security, judiciary, and institutional improvements. The U.S. suggested reducing reliance on direct U.N. assistance but supporting democratic institutions, infrastructure, and security training through international aid. Assistance could come from various sources like UNDP, World Bank, and expert advisors without compromising East Timor's sovereignty. The debate over the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states like East Timor raises questions about the duration of UN presence, necessary international support, and criteria for measuring aid effectiveness and capacity building progress. Donor fatigue and limited budgets add pressure for assistance, complicating decision-making processes."
