The owner or agent of a patent can apply for an interim extension if the regulatory review period for the product covered by the patent extends beyond its expiration.

If the patent is deemed eligible for an extension, a notice will be published in the Federal Register, and a certificate of interim extension will be issued for up to 1 year. The owner of a patent can apply for an interim extension if the regulatory review period extends beyond the patent's expiration. Up to 4 subsequent interim extensions can be applied for, with specific application timelines. Each extension is recorded in the patent file and considered part of the original patent. The extension terminates 60 days after commercial marketing permission, unless the Commissioner is notified within that period. The Commissioner may grant further extension of a patent for up to 5 years from the original expiration date if additional information is provided. Rights during the extension period are limited to uses under regulatory review. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.
