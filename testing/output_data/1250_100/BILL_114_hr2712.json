    "content": "The \"Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015\" includes provisions for a prospective reporting system and protection of dependent privacy. Congress aims to minimize compliance burdens under the Affordable Care Act while balancing the need for sufficient reporting and individual privacy. The Act mandates the implementation of a voluntary prospective reporting system by the Treasury Secretary within 180 days. Employers can report essential coverage details for full-time employees through this system. The Act mandates a voluntary reporting system for employers to report coverage details for full-time employees, including dependents, spouses, part-time employees, minimum value requirements, affordability safe harbors, availability to employees, and any waiting periods, to be reported 60 days before coverage starts. The Act requires a reporting system for employers to provide information on employee eligibility for premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The Act mandates a reporting system for employers to verify employee eligibility for subsidies and to update coverage changes. Employers meeting reporting requirements are exempt from certain IRS reporting obligations. The Act mandates employers to provide statements to the IRS and employees if they receive notice that an employee has enrolled in a qualified health plan through the Exchange. Employers can use third parties for filing without affecting their liability under the Internal Revenue Code. Each Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act must notify employers when an employee or dependent enrolls in a qualified health plan through the Exchange, as required by sections 6055 or 6056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 4 amends Section 6055(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to allow substitution of name and date of birth for TINs for dependents if not collected before January 1, 2014. Effective date is 60 days after enactment. SEC. 5 relates to electronic statements. Section 6056(c) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow electronic delivery of statements if prior consent is given by the individual. Similarly, Section 6055(c) is amended to allow electronic delivery of health insurance coverage statements with prior consent. The amendments made by this section allow electronic delivery of health information with prior consent, effective for statements due after December 31, 2015. SEC. 6. GAO STUDIES. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study evaluating employer notifications by Exchanges under the Affordable Care Act regarding employee eligibility for tax credits and subsidies from 2014 to 2016. This includes data elements, notification process development, and formal comment periods. The study will evaluate employer notifications by Exchanges under the Affordable Care Act from 2014 to 2016, focusing on the adequacy of information provided, total number of notifications sent, differences between Federal and State-Based Marketplaces, challenges in the notification process, and recommendations for improvement. Additionally, it will assess if a separate appeals process for employers has been established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Comptroller General will conduct a study to evaluate the functionality of the prospective reporting system established under section 3 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A report on the results of the study will be submitted to relevant committees within one year of the Act's enactment. The Comptroller General will evaluate the prospective reporting system under the Affordable Care Act and submit a report to relevant committees by July 1, 2018. SEC. 7. ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ACA SUBSIDIES. A marketplace can automatically reenroll individuals in a qualified health plan if eligibility for subsidies is redetermined annually, taking into account changes in premiums, Federal poverty level, and income data. If the marketplace does not follow the specified processes, reenrollment with subsidies is not allowed until current income information is provided. The provisions in this section aim to align with the guidance on annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for marketplace coverage issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Secretary must ensure comprehensive rules for annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for coverage and tax credits, consistent with the guidance from April 22, 2015. Enrollees eligible for automatic reenrollment in a qualified health plan must maintain authorization for disclosure of information verifying eligibility for subsidies. The marketplace requires updated income information annually to verify eligibility for credit or cost-sharing reduction. Enrollees must receive timely notices about rules for annual redeterminations and reenrollments. The term \"marketplace\" refers to State Based Exchanges and the Federally Facilitated Exchange under the Affordable Care Act."
