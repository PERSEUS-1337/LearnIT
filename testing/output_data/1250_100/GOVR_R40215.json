    "content": "On January 14, 2009, OMB Director-designate Peter Orszag discussed plans for oversight of the economic stimulus package before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He proposed creating a special oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer to review problems and hold regular meetings. The Obama Administration later established the Recovery.gov website to provide information on contracts and financial details. An oversight board will update the Recovery.gov website to track spending from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Concerns exist about agencies' capacity to spend funds efficiently. The House and Senate passed versions of the bill in January and February 2009. As of February 12, 2009, the House and Senate were negotiating differences in the stimulus legislation. Challenges in responding to crises include balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Building the capacity of federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better respond to crises is a longer-term issue. The 9-11 Commission emphasized the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to anticipate and avoid preventable crises. Organizational, procedural, and system-related options can be explored to address these challenges. The federal government operates as a system of \"nested\" oversight, with Congress overseeing the President and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Inspectors general and agencies like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) provide support for oversight. OMB is responsible for managing agencies and overseeing their activities. Different perspectives on oversight objectives include compliance. The federal government operates with nested oversight, where Congress oversees the President and agencies like OMB. Different perspectives on oversight objectives include compliance with laws, congressional intent, avoiding mismanagement and bias, ensuring effectiveness and efficiency of funded activities. Implementation by agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs will determine how these oversight perspectives are approached. Selected general oversight provisions in economic stimulus legislation are analyzed in Table 1. References to \"the Act\" within each bill generally refer to either Division A or Division B of the bill, not the entire bill."
