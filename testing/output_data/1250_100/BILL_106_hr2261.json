It includes a new section, SEC. 25B, which provides a credit for health insurance costs for previously uninsured individuals and those with COBRA coverage. The \"Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 1999\" includes a new section, SEC. 25B, which allows a tax credit for health insurance costs paid by individuals for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. The credit is 60% of the amount paid during the taxable year, with monthly limitations based on the type of coverage. The term 'eligible month' refers to a month starting at least 1 year after the individual was eligible for or participated in a group health plan. For joint returns, both spouses must have eligible months. Amounts paid for coverage are not considered if the individual is already covered under a medical care program. The limitation for the credit under this section applies to individuals covered under specific medical care programs, including those under the Social Security Act, Title 10, Title 38, Title 5, or the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. A special rule applies to married individuals who do not file joint returns and do not live apart from their spouse. The credit amount is limited based on adjusted gross income. The credit under this section is subject to reduction based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. The reduction amount is calculated based on a ratio of the taxpayer's income over the applicable dollar amount. Modified adjusted gross income includes adjustments to gross income. The applicable dollar amount for qualified health insurance coverage is $60,000 for taxpayers covering more than one individual and $30,000 for other cases or married individuals filing separately. Marital status is determined under section 7703. Qualified health insurance is defined as medical care insurance without certain exclusions. The text discusses the exclusion of certain insurance coverage under section 213(d) and (e) of the tax code, including group health plans and continuation coverage under COBRA. It also mentions special rules regarding deductions and coordination with other benefits. Special rules under section (f) state that no credit is allowed if qualified health insurance payments are used for deductions under sections 213 or 222. Additionally, the credit is denied to dependents if a deduction is allowable to another taxpayer for the same taxable year. An inflation adjustment is applied to dollar amounts in subsection (c)(3) for taxable years after 2000. The taxable year begins in calendar year 1999, with rounding to the nearest multiple of $100.
