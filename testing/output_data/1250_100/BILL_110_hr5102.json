    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". The growth in international trade, particularly containerized trade, is increasing pressure on the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. From 2000 to 2005, international trade value rose from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with containerized trade shipments increasing from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. Existing and potential trade agreements indicate a further rise in international trade and freight congestion. The US is a member of the World Trade Organization, has 11 free trade agreements, and is negotiating with 4 countries and multi-lateral organizations for more agreements. Traffic congestion in US cities is a significant issue, leading to wasted time, fuel costs, and economic losses. Investments in transportation infrastructure are necessary to maintain and improve traffic conditions for economic productivity. The Act aims to address transportation investment needs in national trade gateway corridors, reduce freight congestion, and enhance the reliability of the freight transportation system to improve the quality of life for US citizens. Establishment and collection of national trade gateway corridor fee. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on imported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee will be collected for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. The fee established under this subsection for imported articles will be deposited in a designated account and will not apply after fiscal year 2017. Additionally, a national trade gateway corridor fee will be imposed on exported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee established for carrying out eligible projects in transportation trade corridors will be collected by the Secretary of Transportation and deposited in the \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account. The fee will not apply after fiscal year 2017. The \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account will consist of deposited amounts for transportation projects. The Secretary of Transportation can use the funds for expenditures until October 1, 2018, to fulfill obligations under the Act. SEC. 4. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS. The Secretary of Transportation sets aside 2 percent of funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund for administrative expenses. After this set-aside, the remaining funds are apportioned to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on fees collected at Customs ports of entry. The Secretary of Transportation allocates funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on fees collected at Customs ports of entry. If a corridor spans multiple states, the funds are divided among the states based on lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways. Amounts granted to a State department of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors from apportioned funds remain available for 6 years. Unobligated funds after this period are reallocated to other States for eligible projects at the Secretary's discretion. SEC. 5. PROJECT SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation to follow in selecting eligible projects for grants under this Act. Guidelines include consulting with various stakeholders, adhering to planning processes, developing a transparent selection process, and rating proposed projects. The guidelines for project selection under this Act include consulting stakeholders, following planning processes, developing a transparent selection process, and clearly identifying the basis for rating projects. The grant program outlined in Section 6 of the Act includes guidelines for project selection, consulting stakeholders, following planning processes, developing a transparent selection process, and clearly identifying the basis for rating projects. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds to a State department for projects in transportation trade corridors. Projects must meet specific construction standards and have a Federal share of 80%. Non-Federal funds cannot be used for the project. Prevailing Rate of Wage under Section 113 of title 23, United States Code, applies to projects receiving assistance under this section, similar to projects under chapter 1 of the same title. SEC. 7. TRANSPORTATION TRADE CORRIDORS. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry, with specific criteria for their boundaries and locations. These corridors may include areas in multiple contiguous states, extend up to 300 miles from the port of entry, and only include areas used for international trade-related movements. Additionally, a single corridor can be established for multiple ports of entry located close to each other, with a deadline of 180 days for the establishment of proposed corridors after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Transportation must publish proposed transportation trade corridor boundaries within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A 45-day comment period will follow for public input. Final corridor boundaries must be published within one year. Periodic reviews and modifications may be conducted annually before the fiscal year ends. The Secretary of Transportation must establish transportation trade corridor boundaries for each Customs port of entry where fees were collected in the previous fiscal year. The corridors must align with the objectives of the Act. The Secretary of Transportation is required to issue regulations within one year of the Act's enactment. Appropriations from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2018. Grants approved by the Secretary for highway projects are considered contractual obligations of the Government. Definitions are provided in Section 10 of the Act. In this Act, definitions for \"eligible project,\" \"Federal-aid highway,\" and \"State\" are provided. Eligible projects include those under title 23, US Code, and improvements to intermodal freight facilities. Federal-aid highway is defined as in title 23, US Code, and State refers to any of the 50 States. The term \"State\" in the United States Code refers to any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The term \"State department of transportation\" is defined under section 101 of title 23, United States Code. The term \"United States\" encompasses the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico."
