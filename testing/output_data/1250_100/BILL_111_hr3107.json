    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objective of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA and its Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes worldwide. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007, with over $4.4 million given in 2008. Proliferation concerns were raised due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and expertise provided through the Technical Cooperation Program. The State Department reported three direct TC projects in Iran in 2007. The GAO report highlighted proliferation concerns related to the Technical Cooperation Program, particularly in Iran. The report noted difficulties in identifying and resolving these concerns due to a lack of formal mechanisms and documentation. Additionally, it was mentioned that the program does not exclude countries based on political considerations. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program, stating that there is uncertainty regarding whether assistance has contributed to weapons programs in certain countries. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits funding for programs in countries like Libya, Iran, Cuba, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1998 and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 imposed restrictions on funding for IAEA programs in Cuba. The GAO report recommended withholding a share of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries of concern. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions by continuing heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges, with 5,000 in operation, and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about Iran's nuclear program, noting outstanding issues and Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol. Iran has not provided access to key locations related to uranium enrichment and other activities as requested by the Security Council. Iran has repeatedly failed to cooperate with the IAEA regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, refusing to comply with multiple resolutions and blocking inspections of its nuclear facilities. Iran recently denied access to its enrichment site at Natanz, as reported by news sources. In April 2008, Syria was revealed to be building a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour with North Korea's assistance, capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The reactor was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. General Michael Hayden stated that the reactor could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour had features resembling those of an undeclared facility. The IAEA Director General stated that Syria has not provided requested documentation or access to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. No US funds to IAEA can support Technical Cooperation for countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism, in breach of safeguards agreements, or under investigation. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions proportional to IAEA spending on assistance from 2007 to 2008. The Secretary of State must withhold US funds to IAEA if assistance is provided to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism, in breach of safeguards agreements, or under investigation. If the specified amount is not withheld within 30 days, an equal amount will be withheld from the United States assessed contribution to the IAEA. The waiver provision allows for exceptions if the IAEA suspends assistance to certain countries or if the President certifies that these countries no longer pose a threat. The President must instruct the US Representative to the IAEA to oppose funding for assistance to these countries. A report on the Act's implementation must be submitted to Congress within six months. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \"State sponsor of terrorism\" is defined as a government that has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State."
