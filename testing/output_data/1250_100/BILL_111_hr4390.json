    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention and Control Act of 2009\" and includes enhanced program and provider protections in the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs. The \"Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention and Control Act of 2009\" allows the Secretary to impose requirements on providers or suppliers if there is a significant risk of fraudulent activity in certain categories. The \"Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention and Control Act of 2009\" allows the Secretary to impose requirements on providers or suppliers during enrollment or renewal, including screening, enhanced oversight, enrollment moratoria, and periodic validations. States may be required to implement these provisions in their Medicaid and child health plans. Actions and determinations made under these provisions are not subject to judicial review. The Secretary can establish screening procedures for providers and suppliers, including licensing checks, exclusion list screenings, background checks, site visits, and disclosure of affiliations. Providers may undergo enhanced oversight for 30 to 365 days with required or unannounced site visits. The Secretary can conduct unannounced site visits, prepayment reviews, and enhanced claim reviews for providers and suppliers under titles XVIII, XIX, and XXI. Enhanced oversight may include withholding payment for durable medical equipment from suppliers identified as high risk for fraudulent activity. The Secretary establishes a program for periodic review of physician authorizations to address excessive prescribing. Physicians receive quarterly lists of claims for validation within a 90-day period. Failure to validate claims results in denial of payment for prescribed items and services. The Secretary may impose a moratorium on provider enrollment in cases of serious fraud risk within Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP programs. States can conduct additional provider oversight activities beyond federal requirements. The Secretary can impose a probationary period for new providers to determine legitimacy, including heightened review of claims and validation of prescriptions. If a significant number of claims are found to be illegitimate, further actions may be taken. The Secretary has the authority to suspend or terminate providers or suppliers deemed illegitimate. Failure to cooperate in prescription validation may result in a civil monetary penalty. Prompt pay provisions in the Act are also revised. Amendments are made to the Social Security Act regarding the identification of suspicious or fraudulent claim submissions by providers or suppliers. Medicaid provisions are also adjusted to include entities under moratorium. Amendments to the Social Security Act require states to enforce determinations made by the Secretary regarding fraudulent activity by providers or suppliers. Medicaid programs must outline procedures for addressing significant risks of fraud. The amendments to the Social Security Act require consultation with the Inspector General for identifying significant risks of fraudulent activity by providers or suppliers. Medicaid programs must implement procedures to address such risks. The amendments to the Social Security Act authorize additional funding for identifying fraudulent activity by providers or suppliers under Medicare, Medicaid, or the State children's health insurance program. The effective date for these amendments is upon the enactment of the Act, with expedited implementation within 6 months. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to promulgate regulations within this timeframe. Human Services will issue regulations within 6 months of the Act's enactment, which will be final immediately on an interim basis. The Secretary will allow for public comments on the interim regulation and may make changes after the comment period."
