    "content": "The Western Sahara was a Spanish possession until the mid-1970s when Spain planned to decolonize the region. Morocco and Mauritania both claimed the territory due to its valuable resources. The International Court of Justice found no tie of territorial sovereignty between Morocco and the Western Sahara. In response, Morocco launched a \"Green March\" to claim the region, leading to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian administration. The independence-seeking Polisario resisted the takeover. The majority of Sahrawis fled to refugee camps in Algeria and Mauritania, where the Polisario established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 1976. Morocco occupied Mauritania's sector and built a sand wall to separate the Western Sahara. A long war ensued until a UN settlement plan in 1988 led to a ceasefire in 1991, with a proposed referendum for independence or integration into Morocco. In 1997, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed James A. Baker III to resolve voter identification issues for a referendum in Western Sahara. Despite efforts to restart the process, over 130,000 appeals were made by individuals denied voter identification. The U.N. Security Council suggested considering alternatives to the referendum due to challenges in implementation and lack of cooperation from Morocco and the Polisario. The U.N. also noted the absence of a mechanism to enforce the results of the referendum. The Secretary-General's June 2001 Report proposed a framework agreement for the Western Sahara, including the right to elect executive and legislative bodies. Morocco would control foreign relations, national security, and defense, while a referendum on final status would be held within five years. However, Algeria and the Polisario were critical of the framework for not specifying the final status options. Annan doubted the parties' political will to resolve the conflict and proposed negotiations for changes acceptable to all. The Secretary-General proposed a framework agreement for Western Sahara in June 2001, but doubts were raised about the parties' willingness to cooperate. James Baker presented the Baker Peace Plan in January 2003, suggesting a U.N.-organized referendum for self-determination. Morocco objected to the plan, questioning the U.N.'s involvement. In April 2004, Morocco objected to the U.N. reviving the referendum option for Western Sahara, insisting on autonomy as the only solution and calling for negotiations with Algeria. Algeria and the Polisario accepted the Baker Plan for a referendum, but Algeria refused to negotiate with Morocco. James Baker resigned as the U.N. Secretary-General's personal envoy in June 2004, leading to the cessation of U.N. referendum-related activities. In July 2005, Annan appointed Peter van Walsum as his new envoy for the Western Sahara conflict. Van Walsum stated that a new plan could not be drafted due to Morocco's insistence on excluding independence, while the U.N. could not endorse a plan without a referendum including independence. The options were deadlock or direct negotiations, with responsibility resting on the parties. Security Council Resolution 1754 (2007) called for negotiations without preconditions for self-determination. Meetings between Morocco and the Polisario in 2007 and 2008 did not lead to discussions on each other's proposals. Since independence, Morocco and Algeria have competed for regional dominance, with the Western Sahara conflict serving as a focal point. The neighbors have different decolonization histories and political systems, with Algeria having a leftist orientation from an anti-colonial revolution, while Morocco's monarchy has remained intact. King Mohammed VI has reinforced Morocco's claim to Western Sahara since 1999, despite the territory being a financial burden due to infrastructure investments. The issue has united Moroccans and bolstered support for the monarchy. Morocco sees Western Sahara as a long-term economic opportunity despite financial burdens. King Mohammed VI has advocated for decentralization and emphasized territorial integrity. Morocco presented an autonomy plan to the UN in 2007 and adopted a new constitution in 2011, focusing on government decentralization. Algeria's President Bouteflika has been in office since 1999. Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika supports the Polisario's independence claims in the Western Sahara conflict to keep Morocco diplomatically isolated. Algeria's strong ties in Sub-Saharan Africa have helped the SADR gain African Union membership. Morocco's suspension from the AU in 1984 over the SADR recognition leaves it as the only non-member state on the continent. Christopher Ross has been the U.N. Secretary-General's Personal Envoy on the Western Sahara since 2009. Despite facing criticism from Morocco, Ross has continued in his role, focusing on a new approach for negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario. Christopher Ross, the U.N. Secretary-General's Personal Envoy on the Western Sahara, is preparing for \"shuttle diplomacy\" between Morocco and the Polisario. He advocates for the expansion of UNHCR-supported confidence-building measures and family visits. MINURSO operates in a challenging political and security environment, reporting violations of the cease-fire accord. The U.N. Secretary-General's report notes a gradual shift in the military balance favoring Morocco and highlights operational challenges faced by MINURSO due to a shortage of military personnel. Personnel east of the berm are exposed to terrorist threats. MINURSO's budget has slightly decreased in recent years, with the U.N. Security Council raising troop levels. Concerns have been raised about human rights violations in Moroccan-administered Western Sahara, including restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. Moroccan security forces use disproportionate force to suppress protests by Sahrawis. Morocco uses disproportionate force to suppress Sahrawi protests and restricts freedom of expression. Human rights organizations report torture and ill treatment of Sahrawi prisoners. Positive developments include increased human rights activities and visits by international observers. King Mohammed VI has acknowledged past human rights abuses and compensated victims through a reconciliation commission. Concerns remain over freedom of expression and movement. Moroccan officials and human rights advocates have expressed concerns over freedom of expression and movement in the Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria. There are few recent independent reports on conditions in the camps. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for human rights monitoring in both Moroccan-administered areas and the refugee camps, but Morocco strongly opposes this. The Polisario and some diplomats have called for adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, sparking backlash from Morocco. The human rights situation in Western Sahara and the Tindouf camps is concerning, with calls for independent measures to ensure respect for human rights. Terrorism and insecurity in the region have increased due to arms flows and violent extremist groups. In 2011, European aid workers were kidnapped from the Tindouf camps by a splinter faction of AQIM. Analysts suggest AQIM is expanding recruitment and smuggling operations in the Sahrawi refugee camps. Several individuals of Sahrawi descent were active in MUJWA, with fears that an independent Western Sahara could be vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. The Polisario denies links to AQIM and accuses Moroccan security services of supporting terrorist networks. The United States has not recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara or the SADR, supporting the U.N. settlement plan. In 2012, reports of al-Qaeda involvement in Polisario camps were deemed spurious by the State Department. In 2007, the U.S. supported Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara, urging negotiations for an acceptable autonomy regime. In 2009 and 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reiterated U.S. support for U.N.-led mediation efforts without imposing a solution. Clinton praised Morocco's autonomy plan as credible and realistic in satisfying the aspirations of the people in Western Sahara. In 2012, she continued to support U.N.-backed talks for resolving the issue. In January 2012, Clinton expressed support for finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara during a meeting with the Algerian Foreign Minister. The U.S. continued to back negotiations led by the United Nations and encouraged all parties, including Algeria, to play an active role in seeking a resolution. U.S. statements on the Western Sahara issue are seen in the context of strong U.S.-Moroccan relations, with Morocco being viewed as a key regional ally and partner in counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. prefers a solution that does not destabilize King Mohammed VI's rule or impact security cooperation with Morocco. The U.S. supports finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara through U.N.-led negotiations. The U.S. aims to maintain strong relations with Morocco and avoid destabilizing King Mohammed VI's rule. The U.N. Security Council reauthorized MINURSO in 2014, increasing troop levels to enhance regional stability. The U.S. provides funding for MINURSO but does not contribute uniformed personnel. The United States contributes funding to MINURSO under the U.N. system of assessed contributions. In 2013, there were discussions about adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, but Morocco opposed this and it was not included. In 2014, there were no proposals for human rights monitoring. Many Members of Congress support Morocco's autonomy initiative, while others are concerned about human rights in Moroccan-administered areas of Western Sahara. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act allows bilateral economic assistance for Morocco to be used in Western Sahara. However, funds cannot be programmed in Western Sahara to avoid acknowledging Moroccan sovereignty. Reporting requirements include updating a report on human rights in Western Sahara. The update on human rights in Western Sahara includes steps taken by the Government of Morocco to release political prisoners and support a human rights monitoring role for the U.N. Mission. Efforts to negotiate the release of Moroccan prisoners of war in 2004 were successful. U.N. envoy Ross's shuttle diplomacy has not resolved the stalemate, prompting a call for a comprehensive review by the Security Council in 2015. The U.N. Secretary-General emphasized the need for a settlement due to rising instability in the Sahel region. The international community is urged to address the situation in Western Sahara as part of a broader strategy for the Sahel. The Polisario insists on self-determination through a referendum, while Morocco proposes autonomy under its sovereignty. Some Sahrawis feel caught between the two sides, with uncertain international leverage. The U.N. Secretary-General reports that the cease-fire holds, but the Polisario occasionally threatens armed struggle, dependent on Algeria's support. The Polisario, facing poor relations with Morocco, encourages pro-independence protests but avoids terrorism to maintain international sympathy. Morocco insists on its autonomy proposal for Western Sahara, citing investments and governance reforms as proof of self-determination prospects. Reports of a splinter movement challenging the Polisario's leadership are difficult to assess. The CESE issued reports proposing a new development model for the territory focusing on sustainability, participatory democracy, and social cohesion. International investor interest has increased due to offshore oil exploration, but the status of the territory under international law complicates operations. The Polisario opposes natural resource extraction agreements with Morocco, and if oil is found, it could escalate the conflict. The Sahrawi refugees in Tindouf receive aid from UNHCR and other organizations, funded by donors like the United States. The camps are run by the Polisario, with Algeria not allowing a census of the refugees. This lack of transparency has raised concerns about aid diversion and control over the refugee population. Socioeconomic hardships have led to dissatisfaction among the refugees, especially the youth. The unresolved Western Sahara conflict continues to strain relations between Morocco and Algeria, with the border closed since 1994. The dispute also hinders the Arab Maghreb Union's activity."
