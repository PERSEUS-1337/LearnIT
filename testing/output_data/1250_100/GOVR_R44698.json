Policymakers are reexamining the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A diverse group of families and individuals are in poverty, with a focus on the role of work in their lives. The economic fortunes of individuals, including children and the elderly, are heavily influenced by income from work. Living arrangements and family composition also play a significant role in economic well-being. This snapshot focuses on the composition of people in poverty rather than poverty rates among different groups, providing a different perspective on poverty. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, with different demographic groups experiencing varying poverty rates. The official measure of poverty used by the U.S. Census Bureau is family-based, where an individual's poverty status depends on their income and that of any family members they live with. The size of a group within the overall population can affect its share of the poverty population. Both perspectives on poverty are relevant to public policy. The official poverty measure in the U.S. is family-based, where an individual's income is compared to a threshold based on family composition to determine poverty status. The measure has limitations, such as only looking at pre-tax income and not considering government taxes or non-cash benefits. It also does not account for differences in living costs across the country. The official poverty measure in the U.S. is family-based and does not consider living cost differences or modern resource-sharing arrangements. The Census Bureau has a supplemental poverty measure that adjusts for taxes, transfers, and housing costs. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold, with 13.5% of the population considered poor. There is increasing focus on \"deep poverty,\" with 19.4 million individuals living below 50% of the poverty threshold. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million individuals were living in deep poverty, which is close to half of all people in poverty. The population of people living in poverty included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Children made up one-third of those in poverty, working-age adults the largest share, and the aged accounted for 10%. In 2015, the racial and ethnic composition of people in poverty was analyzed. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest group in both the total and poverty populations, followed by Hispanics and non-Hispanic African-Americans. Most minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population, while non-Hispanic whites and Asians were under-represented. The demographic composition of people in poverty by age group is influenced by overall demographic trends. Children are more racially diverse than adults, with Hispanic children making up a significant portion of poor children. Women are over-represented in the poverty population, possibly due to heading single-parent households. Poverty poses different policy considerations for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Policies regarding family income and poverty status focus on children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents, working-age adults are expected to work, and aged adults may retire and receive benefits. The report separately examines poverty among these groups, emphasizing the importance of work for economic support. Living arrangements and the ability to share resources are also considered. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. Most children rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, with over 90% living in families with at least one adult earner. Among poor children, two-thirds lived in families with earners. In 2015, among poor children, two-thirds lived in families with one or more earners. Majority of poor children lived in families with one earner, while only a small percentage lived in families with two or more earners. Children in female-headed families made up the majority of poor children, but those in married couple families still accounted for a significant portion. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married couple families, a large number of poor children lived in this family type due to its overall population size. In 2015, a substantial number of poor children lived in larger families, which require more income to meet needs. Larger families are more likely to be poor despite most children living in families with earnings. 27% of poor children were in families with four or more children, higher than the overall population. Working-age adults make up the majority of people in poverty in America. In 2015, the majority of people in poverty in America were working-age adults (18-64 years old), representing 56.6% of all individuals in poverty. Among this group, 61.3% did not have earnings from work, with only 38.8% working in some capacity. Reasons for not working included illness or disability, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and other factors. In 2015, a significant portion of working-age adults in poverty were not working due to various reasons such as illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and other factors. Research shows that educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce, with higher credentials leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. The largest group of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential, while those without a high school diploma made up a significant portion as well. In 2015, a majority of working-age adults in poverty lived in families, but a significant portion lived outside of a family arrangement. This group included individuals living alone, with cohabiting partners, or with other unrelated adults/roommates. Determining the poverty status of those living outside of families is complex. The poverty status of working-age adults living with cohabiting partners or other adults is based on individual income, not pooled resources. Aged adults are the least likely to be in poverty, with a poverty rate of 8.8% in 2015. While many aged adults do not work, income from past work, family members, and those who still work is crucial for their economic well-being. Social Security income, based on past earnings, is a significant source of income for aged adults. In 2015, Social Security was received by 62.4% of aged persons in poverty, compared to 86.0% in the total population. Aged persons also receive income from pensions and other benefits earned during their working careers. Retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of those in poverty. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons, with only 11.0% of those in poverty receiving such earnings. In 2015, almost three in four aged adults in poverty lived in families with income from work. Half of them lived alone, a higher rate than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. The report provides basic information about the 43 million people in America below the poverty line in 2015, showing they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults living alone or in families. The report highlights certain groups over-represented in poverty, such as women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone or outside of families. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on parents' income, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past work or that of those they live with. Despite some having work-based income, many still experience poverty due to various individual and systemic circumstances. The report highlights groups over-represented in poverty, such as women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone. Income from work is central in determining poverty status. Systemic circumstances related to poverty warrant further exploration for federal policy interventions."
