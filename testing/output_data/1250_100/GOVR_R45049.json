    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), outlines state assessment requirements for receiving Title I-A funding. Title I-A provides aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged students. States must comply with standards, assessments, and accountability systems to receive funds. The program was funded at $15.5 billion in FY2017. States must implement high-quality academic assessments in reading, math, and science, testing students annually in grades 3-8 and once in high school. Science testing must occur at least once within three grade spans. The ESSA requires states to implement 17 assessments annually for students in elementary and secondary schools, with flexibility in how they are administered. It allows the use of nationally recognized tests for high school assessments and alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. Computer adaptive assessments are also authorized. The ESSA provides flexibility for states in assessment requirements, including exceptions for advanced math students, innovative assessment systems, and grants for assessment audits. This allows for different assessment formats and differentiated student support based on individual learning needs. The report discusses issues related to changes enacted by ESSA regarding assessments in accountability systems, including student growth, students with disabilities and English learners, computer adaptive assessments, participation requirements, and testing burden. States must administer 17 assessments annually in reading, math, and science, using summative assessments to differentiate schools based on student performance. The report focuses on assessments required in Title I-A of the ESEA, outlining state assessment and accountability systems. It discusses academic assessment requirements, changes made by ESSA, State Assessment Grants program, funds allocation, Secretary's ability to reserve funds for assessment audits, and use of innovative assessments. The section examines ESEA assessment requirements for content areas, grades assessed, student participation, and properties of assessments. Under the ESEA, states must implement high-quality academic assessments in reading, math, and science annually in certain grades. Results are used in the state's accountability system to evaluate school performance. The ESSA added new assessment options and requirements for alignment with state standards. The ESEA requires states to use the same academic assessments to measure student achievement, with a focus on testing 95% of all students and subgroups annually. Assessments must be appropriate for students with disabilities and English learners, with provisions for alternate assessments and language accommodations. The ESSA also includes provisions for parents to opt their child out of required assessments. The ESSA allows parents to opt their child out of state assessments and requires LEAs to inform parents of this right. State assessments must meet specific requirements for format, administration, and quality, including measuring higher-order thinking skills. The ESSA provides flexibility in assessment administration, allowing states to use a single summative assessment. Under the ESEA as amended by the ESSA, states can choose to use a single summative assessment or multiple interim assessments leading to a single score. The ESSA also allows states to set a limit on assessment time as a percentage of instructional hours. States must ensure assessments are of high quality and meet technical standards, with evidence now required to be on the state education agency's website. Assessments must be valid, reliable, and measure academic achievement, knowledge, and skills in line with professional standards. The ESSA requires states to use multiple up-to-date measures of academic achievement, including nationally recognized high school assessments aligned with state standards and computer adaptive assessments. These assessments must be valid, reliable, and provide unbiased differentiation between schools. The ESSA requires states to use various measures of academic achievement, including computer adaptive assessments that adjust to individual student responses. These assessments must measure academic proficiency in state standards and growth towards those standards. An exception allows 8th-grade students taking advanced math to take an end-of-course assessment instead of the 8th-grade math assessment under certain conditions. The ESSA requires states to use various measures of academic achievement, including computer adaptive assessments that adjust to individual student responses. An exception allows 8th-grade students taking advanced math to take an end-of-course assessment instead of the 8th-grade math assessment under certain conditions. Each LEA receiving funds under Title I-A must provide public information on state assessments, including subject matter, purpose, source, time spent, schedule, and reporting format. These assessments are used in a state accountability system to identify schools for support and improvement based on performance. States previously determined school progress based on AYP. The ESSA required states to use various academic achievement measures, including adaptive assessments. Schools failing to meet proficiency goals faced accountability consequences. Prior to ESSA, schools could fail to make AYP based on assessment results, triggering improvement requirements. The ESSA introduced changes to the accountability system for schools based on assessment results, aiming to reduce the high-stakes nature of the system. States must use multiple indicators, including student proficiency in math and reading, to differentiate public schools and identify those needing additional support for improvement. Schools require extra support to enhance student achievement. State Education Agencies (SEAs) inform Local Education Agencies (LEAs) about low-achieving schools that need comprehensive support and improvement. SEAs must identify the lowest-performing 5% of Title I-A funded schools, public high schools with graduation rates below 67%, schools not improving after targeted support, and other statewide categories at the state's discretion. States also notify LEAs about subgroups of consistently underperforming students for targeted support. The number of schools subject to accountability may be lower than before ESSA. The ESSA has reduced the high-stakes emphasis on assessment in the accountability system for schools. States now have more control over how assessment results are weighted and how schools are identified for support and improvement. Funding for State Assessment Grants under the ESEA continues through formula and competitive grants, with allocations based on specific criteria within the legislation. The allocation of funds under the ESEA depends on a \"trigger amount\" in the legislation. For appropriations at or below the trigger amount, formula grants are awarded to states. Any excess funds above the trigger amount are used for competitive grants for assessment activities. The Secretary reserves a portion of the funds for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas before awarding grants to states. Each state receives a minimum grant of $3 million, with the remaining funds allocated based on the number of students. The ESEA allows the Secretary to reserve funds for state assessment audits, with up to 20% of formula grant funds allocated for this purpose. States must apply detailing audit plans, stakeholder involvement, and subgrants to LEAs. States must streamline assessment systems based on audit results and report findings. The ESEA allows the Secretary to reserve funds for state assessment audits, with up to 20% of formula grant funds allocated for this purpose. States must apply detailing audit plans, stakeholder involvement, and subgrants to LEAs. The state is required to report the results of the state and each LEA audit in a format that is publicly available. The ESEA as amended by the ESSA includes a new demonstration authority for the development and use of an \"innovative assessment system.\" States or consortia of states may apply for the demonstration authority to develop an innovative assessment system that \"may include competency-based assessments, instructionally embedded assessments, interim assessments, cumulative year-end assessments, or performance based assessments that combine into an annual summative determination for each student\" and \"assessments that validate when students are ready to demonstrate mastery or proficiency and allow for differentiated student support based on individual learning needs.\" A maximum of seven SEAs, including not more than four states participating in consortia, may receive this authority. Separate funding is not provided under the demonstration authority; however, states may use formula and competitive grant funding provided through the State Assessment Grant program discussed above to carry out this demonstration authority. States and consortia may apply for an \"initial demonstration period\" of three years to develop innovative. States and consortia can apply for an initial demonstration period of three years to develop and implement innovative assessment systems in a subset of LEAs. If successful, they can apply for a two-year extension to transition the system statewide. The innovative assessments must meet general state assessment requirements and can include various formats like competency-based assessments and performance-based assessments. Reporting results in terms of student competencies aligned with state standards is allowed. States have the authority to select their own assessments and academic standards for alignment. They use state-specific, common, or a combination of assessments for grades 3-8 and high school levels. The ESSA introduced the option of using a \"nationally recognized\" high school assessment. NCLB expanded state assessment requirements under ESEA. In 2002, the NCLB expanded state assessments under ESEA, leading to each state having its own academic standards and assessments. In 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative was developed to create common standards for reading and math, allowing for comparisons among states. Adoption of these standards is optional. The Obama Administration supported the Common Core State Standards through initiatives like Race to the Top State Grants and RTT Comprehensive Assessment Systems Grants. The Department of Education funded consortia like PARCC and SBAC to develop assessments aligned with the standards. The Obama Administration supported the adoption of Common Core State Standards through initiatives like Race to the Top State Grants and RTT Comprehensive Assessment Systems Grants. States were encouraged to align their assessments with these standards to receive waivers of certain ESEA provisions. Initial interest in common assessment administration was high, but participation declined in later years. Both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations also emphasized measuring student achievement based on growth rather than proficiency only. The Obama Administration encouraged states to incorporate measures of student growth into their accountability systems through waivers. Two organizations, ECS and Education Week, collect data on state assessments to meet Title I-A requirements. The most recent surveys were published in January and February 2017. The state of assessment prior to states submitting their state plan under the provisions of the recently amended ESEA shows a variety of approaches. Some states used a combination of common assessments, state-specific assessments, end-of-course exams, and nationally recognized high school academic assessments. Others relied entirely on common assessments, with some using only SBAC or PARCC assessments. The status of state assessment systems is evolving as states submit their ESEA consolidated state plans to receive funding under Title I-A. States are set to receive funding under various ESEA formula grant programs, including Title I-A, in 2017. Each state's plan must be approved by the Secretary, with all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico required to submit their plans by specific deadlines. State plans detail the assessments they will use to meet Title I-A requirements, with some states opting for combinations of assessments like SBAC, end-of-course exams, and PSAT/SAT, while others rely primarily on state-specific annual assessments. The ESEA amendments by the ESSA provide states with more flexibility in using assessments for accountability, potentially adding nuance to state accountability systems. The changes to Title I-A requirements must maintain the validity and reliability of state assessments for effective state accountability systems. The report discusses assessment-related issues under ESSA changes, including student growth, special needs assessments, computer adaptive assessments, opt-out practices, and testing burden. ESSA adjustments aim to enhance assessment use in accountability systems while addressing valid and reliable assessment practices. Prior to ESSA, state accountability systems focused solely on reporting student proficiency, which critics argued was not a valid measure of school quality or teacher effectiveness. This singular focus led to unintended consequences such as instruction being targeted towards students just below the proficient level. The adjustments made under ESSA aim to address these issues and enhance the use of assessments in accountability systems. Under ESSA, states, LEAs, and schools are required to report data on student proficiency on assessments. Some education policy groups advocate for using a \"performance index\" instead of focusing solely on proficiency. This index would give credit for various levels of achievement, incentivizing schools to improve all students' performance. The ESSA allows for student achievement to be measured using student growth in addition to proficiency levels. Scale scores are recommended for reporting achievement as they are more sensitive to changes and allow for accurate comparisons across students and schools. Some states had already incorporated measures of student growth prior to ESSA, and more states may choose to do so under the amended ESEA. The ESSA allows for student growth to be included in accountability systems, with states using different models such as state-set targets, student growth percentiles, and SAS EVAAS to measure growth. These models assess how much a student has grown relative to benchmarks or peers. The SAS EVAAS model measures value-added growth, which refers to the additional positive effect on student achievement above expected growth. The CCSSO outlined considerations for growth models in ESEA accountability systems, identifying five common models like gain scores and growth rates. Gain scores calculate the difference between test scores, while growth rates use multiple assessment results to fit a trend line. Statistically fitting a \"trend line\" across data points helps aggregate data across grade levels. Student growth percentiles compare academic achievement to peers, reported as percentiles. Transition tables use discrete performance levels for growth calculations. Residual models, or value-added models, describe outside factors' effect on student growth over time. Some education policy groups caution against using a \"growth to proficiency\" model in measuring student progress. This model may incentivize focusing on students near proficiency levels, neglecting those far below or above. States may consider weighting different types of growth to address this issue. Measuring student growth in accountability systems allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of student learning over time. Growth models can provide a more valid measure of school accountability by considering a student's prior achievement levels. Schools may not be penalized for low-achieving students if they meet growth targets. Reliable assessments sensitive to student learning are essential for measuring growth targets. The ESEA mandates annual academic assessments for all students, with special provisions for students with disabilities and English learners. The use of alternate assessments in state accountability systems is limited for ELs, depending on their English proficiency and time in the US. States must include all students with disabilities in statewide assessments and disaggregate results. The ESEA requires assessments to be developed using universal design for learning principles to ensure full participation of students with disabilities. UDL principles can be used in assessments to reduce cognitive burden by providing multiple means of representation, action, and engagement. Accommodations for students with disabilities, like \"read aloud\" for reading disabilities, ensure valid assessment results. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) allows for alternate assessments aligned with alternate standards for students with the \"most significant cognitive disabilities.\" States must develop guidelines to identify these students, and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the student's Individualized Education Program team. Parents must be informed of the decision and how it may affect the student's participation in regular assessments. The Every Student Succeeds Act allows for alternate assessments aligned with alternate standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities. States must identify eligible students, often those with intellectual disabilities, autism, or multiple disabilities. The \"1% cap\" limits the number of students assessed with alternate standards at the state level. LEAs exceeding the cap must justify to the SEA. Scores over the cap are considered nonproficient. Alternate assessments are considered more valid for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The alternate assessment standards are better aligned with academic content for students with significant cognitive disabilities. While more valid, reliability issues may arise due to different test formats and scoring methods. Consistent scorer agreement is crucial for maintaining validity in the accountability system. States must ensure that all English Learners (ELs) participate in statewide assessments, including assessments of English language proficiency (ELP) and assessments of reading, mathematics, and science. Most states use the WIDA consortium for ELP assessments, which includes the development and administration of the ACCESS 2.0 test. The WIDA consortium changed English language proficiency standards in 2017, leading to fewer students exiting support programs. EL students may be included in accountability determinations longer. States must assess ELs in reading, math, and science, with accommodations and possible alternative language assessments. ESEA requires assessing ELs in English after three years, but LEAs can assess in a different language case-by-case. The ESSA allows states to assess EL students in a different language for up to two consecutive years if they have not reached English proficiency for reading assessments. States can also exclude EL students from reading assessments for up to 12 months. Additionally, states have the option to assess recently arrived EL students in reading and math but exclude their results from accountability purposes. Results of academic assessments for ELs must be reported separately. The ESSA allows states to include the scores of formerly identified ELs in the EL subgroup for four years after they cease to be identified as ELs. This change may result in ELs remaining in the subgroup for a longer time, potentially improving subgroup performance as students gain higher English proficiency levels. The ESSA has altered the composition of the EL subgroup, which could lead to increased subgroup performance. The ESSA allows for the inclusion of formerly identified ELs in the EL subgroup for four years, potentially improving subgroup performance. The ESSA explicitly authorizes the use of computer adaptive assessments to meet Title I-A requirements, clarifying that all students do not need to receive the same assessment items. A computer adaptive assessment adjusts to a student's responses, getting more difficult until a \"ceiling\" is reached. It can measure a student's ability above or below grade level, as required by the ESEA. The assessment also measures student growth and can be used for alternate assessments for students with disabilities and English language proficiency. Computer adaptive assessments raise concerns about administration time, accurate measurement of special populations, and testing computer literacy skills instead of content areas like reading and mathematics. Some states find them more time efficient than traditional tests. Computer adaptive assessments present challenges related to technical, financial, and reporting issues. Schools using these assessments need to provide computers, software, technical support, and teacher training. Despite potential benefits like quicker scoring and immediate feedback, concerns remain about accurately measuring student proficiency in reading and mathematics. The requirement to assess all students is a key component of statewide assessment systems. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires states to annually measure the achievement of at least 95% of all students and subgroups. Parents have rights to opt their children out of academic assessments, as stated in ESSA provisions. This ensures the validity and reliability of assessment results for school accountability. Excessive numbers of opt-outs may undermine the validity of student achievement measurement and state accountability systems. States are required to assess all students, but a representative sample is more common in education research. In statewide assessment systems under the ESEA, states must assess all students, not a representative sample. Opting out of assessments can lead to an unrepresentative sample, affecting the accuracy of achievement data. The ESEA mandates 17 annual assessments in reading, math, and science. The emphasis on educational assessment within federal education policies has led to debate about the time spent on tests and test preparation in schools. Critics argue that test-based accountability narrows the curriculum by taking away instructional time and leading to increased test preparation activities in the classroom. Teachers may feel pressured to \"teach to the test\" instead of providing broader, higher-level instruction. Test preparation in schools can involve changing classroom assignments to match assessments, reallocating instructional time to tested subjects, and emphasizing reading and math over other subjects. While some test preparation can improve test scores for students unfamiliar with standardized testing, excessive alignment between test items and curricula, coaching on specific test items, or cheating can lead to score inflation. Score inflation occurs when scores on high-stakes assessments increase faster than on low-stakes assessments, reducing the validity of the results. Despite challenges in studying its prevalence, research has shown discrepancies in student achievement levels and gains between state assessments and NAEP. This suggests that state assessment scores may be inflated, calling into question the validity of conclusions drawn from them. The ESSA has introduced provisions to address testing burden and potentially reduce the number of assessments. The ESSA has introduced new provisions to address testing burden by allowing states to set limits on the amount of time spent on assessments and providing grants for audit assessments to determine the necessity of tests at the state and LEA levels."
