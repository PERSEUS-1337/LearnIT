    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Illegal Transshipments Enforcement Act of 2002\". Congress finds that the US textile and apparel sector, employing 1,000,000 workers, is severely impacted by illegal smuggling and transshipment of products, leading to job losses and billions of dollars in losses annually. China and other Asian countries have a history of illegal exports to the US, with a new method involving duty evasion through countries with free trade agreements, exploiting lax enforcement programs. The 1999 Report of the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports highlighted the risks posed by goods in bond programs administered by the Customs Service. It pointed out that federal officials lack sufficient information to make admissibility decisions on this cargo, and existing statutes and regulations do not provide enough deterrence for criminal violations related to the import and export of goods and contraband. Additionally, the report noted that current criminal sanctions for fraud schemes are not effective deterrents, as violators see them as minor obstacles. The 1999 Report highlighted risks of goods in bond programs, lack of information for admissibility decisions, and ineffective deterrence for criminal violations. The purpose of the Act is to establish guidelines to deter commercial fraud, especially in textile and apparel products. SEC. 3. Customs enforcement for in-transit goods and cargo theft. The Secretary of the Treasury mandates inspections for a portion of imported containers, requires prearrival electronic filing of documentation, applies technology for screening in-transit goods, verifies exportation documents, and establishes procedures for physical verification of in-transit goods. The Commissioner coordinates with foreign Customs Services to verify exportation of goods and prevent mislabeling upon importation. Random inspections of 1 out of every 10 containers after importation are required, along with security checks for employees involved in the import or export of goods. Establish penalties for violations related to in-transit and in-bond textile and clothing goods, including mis-description of products, with penalties not subject to mitigation. Increase the number of field agents and inspectors dedicated to fraud and cargo enforcement to 25% of total Customs Service employees. Form cargo enforcement teams for enhanced enforcement efforts. Establish a cargo fraud enforcement unit in the Customs Service headquarters composed of special agents, inspectors, and import specialists dedicated to managing and overseeing the program. Inspections at ports should be conducted, eliminating centralized inspection stations outside of ports and establishing rail inspection facilities near border entry points. Container rail traffic should be inspected to the same extent as container port traffic. SEC. 4. PUNISHMENT OF CARGO THEFT. Section 659 of title 18, United States Code is amended to remove the term \"with intent to convert to his own use\" and make various additions and changes related to theft of cargo. The amendment also increases the penalty from one year to three years and clarifies that goods and chattel are considered to be moving as an interstate or foreign shipment throughout the transportation process. The amendment to section 659 of title 18, United States Code removes the term \"with intent to convert to his own use\" and enhances penalties for theft of cargo. It also clarifies that goods and chattel are considered in transit during the entire transportation process. Additionally, the amendment introduces an affirmative defense for individuals who possess goods with the intent to report the matter to law enforcement or the owner. The United States Sentencing Commission is tasked with reviewing and amending the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to reflect these changes."
