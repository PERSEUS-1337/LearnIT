The amendment to Section 32902 of title 49, United States Code increases the average fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles to 27.5 miles per gallon for model year 2022 and subsequent years. Regulations for passenger automobiles are also prescribed by the Secretary at least 18 months before each model year. The Secretary prescribes average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles based on vehicle attributes. The standard for model year 2022 and beyond must be at least 35 miles per gallon. Additionally, an alternative minimum standard is provided for passenger automobiles based on vehicle attributes. The alternative minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles is set at either 27.5 miles per gallon or 92 percent of the average fuel economy projected by the Secretary for all manufacturers in that model year. This standard applies only if the manufacturer cannot comply with the average fuel economy standard based on vehicle attributes. The manufacturer can choose to comply with a less stringent average fuel economy standard during a transition period for the first 3 model years. The amendments made by this section will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, with existing standards for passenger automobiles remaining in effect until a new standard is established.
