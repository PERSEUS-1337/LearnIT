    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Workforce Investment for Next-Generation Technologies Act\" or the \"WING Act.\" Congress finds that science- and technology-based industries drive US economic growth and national security, facing challenges from nations with highly trained workforces. Occupations requiring technical training are projected to grow rapidly, especially in national security fields post-9/11. National certification systems in health and IT have attracted more workers, suggesting potential benefits in expanding certification to high-tech industries. National certification systems in various industries promote skill development, interstate comparisons, quality education, industry accountability, and increased employability. Certification offers a pathway to employment for adults and displaced workers, supported by programs like the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education Program. The Advanced Technological Education Program, established in 1992, creates national centers of excellence at community colleges with industry linkages to prepare individuals for the technical workforce. It is recommended to expand this program to all higher education institutions to meet marketplace needs. The one-stop delivery systems under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 effectively provide information and resources for job seekers, including certification programs for displaced workers in technical fields with abundant job opportunities. The purposes of this Act include increasing the numbers of workers educated for high technology industries, aligning educational programs with workforce needs, offering rapid training opportunities, providing skilled technical workers for businesses, and supporting progress towards advanced degrees. Section 171 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to establish 20 pilot projects for industry-validated national certifications of skills, including high-technology industries like biotechnology, telecommunications, and homeland security technology. Grants will be provided to eligible entities for these projects. The Secretary of Labor will provide grants for pilot projects to eligible entities for 36 to 48 months to carry out activities related to industry-validated national certifications of skills. Eligible entities include institutions of higher education, advanced technology education centers, local workforce investment boards, and representatives of businesses in target industries. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, an entity must have a history of effective collaboration with industry on workforce development. The Secretary of Labor will establish criteria for awarding grants and give priority to selected entities. Entities eligible for grants under this subsection must show the ability to provide matching funds from industry or nonprofit sources. The funds can be in cash or in kind. Recipients of the grant must use the funds to establish certification requirements, develop a certification program, and collect data for analysis and best practices identification. The certification requirements for workforce investment boards must be based on industry skill standards linked to national centers of excellence. These requirements aim to demonstrate a set of competencies relevant to the industry and provide evidence of a transferable skill set for workers in high technology industries. The eligible entity must ensure a relationship between certification requirements and training and education programs. The eligible entity must offer a flexible training program related to industry competencies and provide certification upon completion. The certification program should align with the requirements for a 2-year associate degree and be open to students, employed workers, and displaced workers. The Secretary of Labor must consult on these programs. The Secretary of Labor will consult with relevant authorities to ensure pilot projects benefit from existing expertise. After analyzing data from pilot programs, the Secretary will establish core components of a high-technology certification program, set guidelines for uniform standards, and submit reports to Senate and House committees. Data will be made public. The Secretary of Labor will consult with relevant authorities to ensure pilot projects benefit from existing expertise. After analyzing data from pilot programs, the Secretary will establish core components of a high-technology certification program, set guidelines for uniform standards, and submit reports to Senate and House committees. $60,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005 to carry out this subsection."
