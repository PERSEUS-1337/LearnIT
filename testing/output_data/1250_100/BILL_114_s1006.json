    "content": "The \"Positive Train Control Safety Act\" includes provisions for implementation deadlines, transparency, positive train control on high-hazard flammable trains, coordination of spectrum, confidential close call reporting systems, commuter rail track inspections, positive train control at grade crossings effectiveness study, and redundant signal protection. The Positive Train Control Safety Act allows for deadline extensions for implementation under certain circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, such as funding availability and technology constraints. The Positive Train Control Safety Act allows for deadline extensions for implementation under certain circumstances beyond the control of the applicant, such as funding availability and technology constraints. The revised plan must fully implement positive train control by December 31, 2018, considering areas of greater risk and the risk of operational failure. The Secretary must review and approve or disapprove applications within 120 days. The Secretary can extend the implementation deadline for applicants under review, but not beyond June 30, 2016. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY. Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require progress reports from Class I railroad carriers and entities providing rail passenger transportation on the status of their positive train control system plans. Reports must be submitted every year until system certification by the Secretary. The amended Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code now requires annual progress reports from Class I railroad carriers and entities providing rail passenger transportation on their positive train control system plans. The reports must include details on the number of components installed, employees needing training, training status, remaining components to be installed, and challenges to full system implementation. The amended Section 20157(a) of title 49, United States Code now requires annual progress reports on positive train control system implementation, testing, interoperability, and certification challenges. The term 'component' is defined as various railway apparatus. The Secretary must make the report public within 30 days. SEC. 4. POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL ON HIGH-HAZARD FLAMMABLE TRAINS. Amends Section 20157(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code to require each high-hazard flammable train to have positive train control. SEC. 5. COORDINATION OF SPECTRUM. Amends title 49, United States Code to assess spectrum needs for positive train control systems in coordination with the FCC. The Positive Train Control Safety Act amends title 49 of the United States Code to include regulations for establishing confidential close call reporting systems in railroad carriers. The Secretary must develop rules within a year of the Act's enactment, ensuring employee protection from enforcement actions. The Positive Train Control Safety Act requires railroad carriers to develop and submit a confidential close call reporting system program to the Secretary for approval. The program must outline core principles, stakeholder roles, concerns, and operational details. The Secretary will review and either approve or disapprove each program within a reasonable timeframe, providing feedback on any deficiencies that need to be addressed. Railroad carriers must correct deficiencies promptly upon receiving notice from the Secretary, update their program as necessary with approval, and undergo annual compliance reviews. Within two years of the Positive Train Control Safety Act, carriers must establish a confidential close call reporting system to ensure a safe reporting environment for employees. Railroad carriers are required to establish a confidential close call reporting system to protect employees from discipline, implement corrective actions, and identify safety issues before accidents occur. Carriers must consult and reach agreement with directly affected employees on the program development. If an employee labor organization representing affected railroad employees cannot agree on a proposed program, they can file a statement with the Secretary. Non-applicable carriers can voluntarily establish a program under this section. The Secretary can use close call reporting data for inspections, rulemakings, and guidance. The term 'applicable railroad carrier' is defined as a Class I railroad with inadequate safety performance or one that provides intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate necessary funds for implementing this section and supporting nationwide close call reporting system programs. SEC. 7. COMMUTER RAIL TRACK INSPECTIONS. Sec. 7 introduces regulations for commuter rail track inspections, requiring carriers to inspect main lines and sidings regularly to ensure safety. SEC. 8. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the effectiveness of positive train control in reducing collisions at highway-rail grade crossings. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this study.\n\nSEC. 9. Within a year of the Positive Train Control Safety Act, the Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations requiring redundant signal protection for maintenance-of-way work crews dependent on a train dispatcher for signal protection."
