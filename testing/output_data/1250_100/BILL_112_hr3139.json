    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"District of Columbia National Disaster Insurance Protection Act\". It establishes the District of Columbia Natural Disaster Protection Funds. The Act establishes the District of Columbia Natural Disaster Protection Funds, amending the Internal Revenue Code to allow contributions to a natural disaster protection fund and providing special rules for assets held in the fund. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for distributions from a natural disaster protection fund, excluding certain distributions from gross income if made before the filing of the tax return. The term 'natural disaster protection fund' refers to money, securities, or property held by a qualified insurance company in a segregated account designated for this purpose. The fund must be held in a bank in the District of Columbia and invested according to local laws. Excess balance drawdown amounts are required to be distributed to the qualified company. The term 'qualified insurance company' refers to an insurer or reinsurer incorporated and domiciled in the District of Columbia, subject to supervision by the District of Columbia Commissioner of Insurance, Securities, and Banking, maintaining an office with a minimum number of employees, and subject to premium taxes. Assets from the natural disaster protection fund must be distributed to the qualified company by the close of the following taxable year. The District of Columbia imposes premium taxes and fees on domestic insurance companies, along with additional taxes on natural catastrophic risk coverage written through the fund. The qualified contribution refers to a contribution by a qualified insurance company to the fund. A qualified contribution by an insurance company to a fund is limited to the total of net premiums received during the taxable year for coverage of qualified losses. Qualified distributions from the fund include payments for qualified losses under insurance or reinsurance contracts, spreading the risk of catastrophe loss, and excess balance drawdown amounts. The qualified contribution by an insurance company to a fund is limited to net premiums received for coverage of qualified losses. Qualified distributions from the fund include payments for insured losses due to events like wind, earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption, fire, hail, snow, and other catastrophes. The text discusses criteria for a catastrophe designation or minimum aggregate insured loss, which includes events like a pandemic or public health catastrophe. Insured losses must exceed $1 billion industry-wide, be declared a disaster by the President, or by a Governor or chief executive of a state. The Property Claims Services unit of Insurance Services Office, Inc., declares a catastrophic industry-wide loss due to one or more events. The excess balance drawdown amount is defined as the fund balance exceeding the total exposure to qualified losses. United States risk refers to hazards or liabilities in the US or its territories. Premiums and losses on certain Puerto Rican risks are excluded. Contributions and losses related to risks covered by a catastrophe reserve in Puerto Rico are excluded from consideration in determining qualified contributions or losses. Transfers of property to a fund are treated as sales or exchanges at fair market value, with adjustments to the property's basis. Distributions of property from a fund to a qualified insurance company are treated similarly, with any gains or losses excluded from the company's gross income. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for the exclusion of certain income from a qualified insurance company. An additional tax is imposed on nonqualified distributions from a natural disaster protection fund by a qualified insurance company, with a 20 percent increase in tax for such distributions. The bill imposes an additional tax on nonqualified distributions from a natural disaster protection fund by a qualified insurance company. The amendments made by this bill will apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2011."
