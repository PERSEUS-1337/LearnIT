    "content": "The \"Federal Wetlands Jurisdiction Act of 2004\" clarifies the jurisdiction of the Federal Government over waters of the United States, provides consistency nationwide, and consolidates authority in one Federal agency for implementing permitting programs under the Federal Water Pollution Act. Section 404(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to clarify the jurisdiction of waters of the United States under the permitting program. This includes navigable waters, waters hydrologically connected to navigable waters, and wetlands adjacent to these waters. The jurisdiction of waters of the United States under the permitting program includes navigable waters, waters connected by perennial or intermittent streams contributing flow, and wetlands adjacent to these waters. Excluded waters are those not hydrologically connected by surface flow, such as sheet flow, ephemeral waters, groundwater, manmade ditches, pipelines, or storm sewer systems. The jurisdiction of the permitting program includes navigable waters, connected waters, and wetlands. Fastlands are excluded from this program. Requests for jurisdiction determination can be made to the Secretary. The Secretary may request additional information within 30 days of receiving a jurisdiction determination request. Within 90 days of the initial request or 60 days of receiving additional information, the Secretary will make a jurisdictional determination and notify the requester in writing. Any person authorized to request a jurisdictional determination for property may seek judicial review or injunctive relief in the United States District Court or proceed under the administrative appeals process. Review, relief, or appeal may be sought for any waters. Any person may seek judicial review in the United States District Court for the final decision of the Secretary under the administrative appeals process for waters described in the request. SEC. 4. SINGLE AGENCY IMPLEMENTATION. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's authorities under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act are transferred to the Secretary of the Army. The Administrator retains the authority to comment on permits issued under section 404(a) and general permits issued under section 404(e). All funds appropriated to the Administrator for these authorities are transferred to the Secretary. Conforming amendments are made to section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. \"No agreement shall allow agencies to request permit decisions to be elevated above the District Engineer.\" SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) is amended to include definitions for \"navigable,\" \"wetlands,\" and \"adjacent wetlands.\" Navigable waters are those used for interstate commerce, wetlands are lands with hydric soils inundated by water, and adjacent wetlands are wetlands physically touching other wetlands. The curr_chunk defines terms related to wetlands, culverts, and fastlands. Adjacent wetlands are wetlands touching described waters, culverts convey streams under linear structures, and fastlands are areas behind manmade structures for commercial use."
