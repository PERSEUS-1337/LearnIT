    "content": "Federal inspectors general (IGs) have substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and some employees have law enforcement authority. This report lists statutes and regulations granting OIGs law enforcement authority, essential for certain missions. Some federal agencies, including OIGs, express a need for law enforcement authority. OIGs have unique missions that may require this authority, such as weapons procurement oversight. Examples include the SSA's OIG explaining ammunition purchases for agent safety and training, and the USDA's OIG receiving inquiries about weapons and body armor solicitations. The USDA's OIG received inquiries about weapons and body armor solicitations for replacing firearms. The OIG's Investigations division conducts numerous criminal investigations each year, involving potentially life-threatening situations, with over 2,000 indictments and $460 million in monetary results from FY 2012 to March 2014. OIG Special Agents are authorized to make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms for undercover operations and surveillance. OIG special agents conduct undercover operations and surveillance for investigations involving criminal activities such as fraud, theft, bribery, smuggling, and violence against USDA employees. They can be vested with law enforcement authority through the IG Act or by the Attorney General. The IG Act provides direct law enforcement authority to 25 federal entities. The Attorney General can delegate law enforcement authority to OIGs under the IG Act when certain criteria are met. Ten agencies, including the National Archives and Records Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have been granted this authority. Guidelines for the use of these powers are established by the Attorney General. The Attorney General can delegate law enforcement authority to OIGs under the IG Act, with guidelines established by the Attorney General. OIGs with law enforcement authority must undergo specific training and follow DOJ policies, including deadly force policy and approval for undercover investigations. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains a Census on Federal Law Enforcement Officers, including data on the number of federal employees authorized to carry firearms. A report from September 2008 shows that 33 OIGs had 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms, with no reported assaults or injuries to law enforcement officers within an OIG in 2008."
