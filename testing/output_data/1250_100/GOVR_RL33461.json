    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed a bill with $100 million more funding for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version includes no funding for the project. The Yucca Mountain site was the only location considered for a national high-level radioactive waste repository under the NWPA. The Obama Administration halted funding for the project in 2010 and withdrew the license application. Despite Congress approving the funding halt, NWPA still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new nuclear waste policy with a \"consent based\" process for siting repositories and storage facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a \"consent-based\" process for siting nuclear waste facilities. DOE issued a strategy for a new waste program, calling for a new management entity to develop storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim storage facility was to open by 2021, with a larger-scale facility by 2025 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. DOE issued a draft siting process in 2017, and the House approved a bill in 2018. The House approved a bill in 2018 (H.R. 3053) to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site from other uses under public lands laws, meeting NRC licensing conditions. NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report in response to a court order, determining the repository's compliance with safety standards. Construction authorization is pending completion of land and water rights requirements and an environmental impact statement supplement. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS in May 2016 and made Yucca Mountain licensing documents publicly available. Then-NRC Chairman Stephen Burns stated that $330 million in additional appropriations would be needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada and others. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million for NRC licensing activities in FY2019 for Yucca Mountain, plus $120 million for DOE to defend its license application and develop interim storage facilities. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities, potentially easier to site, license, and construct than a combined defense-civilian repository. The Department of Energy (DOE) considered a defense-only nuclear waste repository as potentially easier to site, license, and construct than a combined defense-civilian repository. DOE's draft plan estimated that disposal of defense waste could begin about 22 years after a consent-based siting process were started. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report in January 2017 that assessed DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository as excluding major costs \"that could add tens of billions of dollars\" and including a schedule. Republican leaders criticized DOE's plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository, aiming to deflect progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation introduced in 2017 and 2018 would block development of a defense-only repository until a licensing decision is made on Yucca Mountain. The FY2019 appropriations bill included provisions for DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, prioritizing fuel from closed nuclear plant sites. The DOE is required to report to Congress on the need for compensation or incentives for host jurisdictions for a pilot storage facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee has included provisions for a consent-based pilot program for interim storage in previous Energy and Water Development funding bills. The House has not included similar provisions in its bills. A nuclear waste bill passed by the House authorizes DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor. In the 114th Congress, bipartisan legislation called the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) was introduced but not enacted. The bill aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to find sites for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities with consent from state and local officials and affected Indian tribes. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico in 2017. The facility, to be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, is planned to hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. The facility would be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, with each phase consisting of 500 canisters containing up to a combined 8,680 metric tons of spent fuel. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, where the company currently operates two low-level radioactive waste storage facilities. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) have applied for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. The facility would be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, with each phase consisting of 500 canisters containing up to a combined 8,680 metric tons of spent fuel. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners for this project. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, where WCS currently operates two low-level radioactive waste storage facilities. The Department of Energy (DOE) would cover costs for fuel storage at nuclear plant sites and transportation to the Texas facility for up to 40 years, with possible extensions. WCS argues that a privately developed storage facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions that prohibit DOE from building a storage facility without progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request included funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository, with an additional $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application. DOE would also receive $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The total funding of $120 million for nuclear waste in FY2019 would come from two appropriations accounts. The FY2018 budget request included $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version of the bill passed without Yucca Mountain funding. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, citing uncertainty about the program's future. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague to estimate costs accurately, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program with a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. NRC replaced its \"waste confidence\" rule with a continued storage rule after a court ruling in 2012. The court found that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing the waste confidence findings. The NRC replaced its \"waste confidence\" rule with a continued storage rule in response to a court ruling in 2012. This decision allowed for the approval of new reactors, spent fuel storage facilities, and license renewals. A consolidated lawsuit challenging the continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2016. Additionally, the NRC proposed modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final revisions issued by the commission in 2017. The NRC issued revisions in 2017 for low-level waste disposal regulations, focusing on establishing time periods for technical analyses to protect the general population. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires DOE to focus on Yucca Mountain as a repository for highly radioactive waste, despite opposition from Nevada due to safety concerns. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository in FY2011, leading to the shutdown of the project by the end of FY2010. President Trump plans to restart the Yucca Mountain project, allocating $120 million in his FY2019 budget for licensing and interim waste storage. DOE previously tried to withdraw the license application under the Obama Administration but faced opposition from Nevada and other states. The Yucca Mountain project faced opposition from Nevada and other states when the DOE tried to withdraw the license application under the Obama Administration. The ASLB denied the license withdrawal motion, and the NRC commissioners sustained the decision on a tie vote. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the withdrawal, leading to a court ruling that NRC must continue work on the license application as long as funding is available. NRC directed its staff to complete the Yucca Mountain project in response. The NRC responded to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report (SER) in 2013. The SER concluded in 2014 that the proposed repository design would comply with safety standards for 1 million years. NRC completed the final volumes of the SER in 2015 and stated that construction should not proceed until all requirements were met. Additional funding of $330 million was needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on issues raised by Nevada. The Obama Administration halted the Yucca Mountain project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories using a consent-based process. In response, the DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, calling for the development of consent-based storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility was planned to open by 2021 under this strategy. The DOE planned to open a storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was set to open by 2048. Public meetings were held to develop a consent-based siting process, addressing issues like fairness, site-selection models, and information requirements. DOE issued a draft siting process in 2017 with five phases, including community outreach and preliminary site assessment. Legislation would authorize a waste management agency to conduct the process and provide grants to interested communities. Phase 2 involves a preliminary site assessment lasting 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-4 years for a permanent repository. Phase 3 includes a detailed site assessment taking 2-4 years for interim storage and 5-10 years for a repository. Phase 4 consists of an agreement phase lasting 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-5 years for a repository. Phase 5 covers licensing, construction, operation, and closure, with estimated timelines of up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal aims to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019. The nuclear power industry supports completion of NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and alternative storage options. The safety of geologic disposal of nuclear waste depends on rock formations. Worldwide consensus favors long-term isolation of radioactive materials until they decay to safe levels. The National Research Council supports geologic isolation as the best option for high-level nuclear waste. However, specific sites like Yucca Mountain face challenges due to uncertainties in waste site performance over 1 million years. Public controversy also surrounds waste transportation routes. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. The Obama Administration focused on fundamental science for nuclear waste research, moving away from reprocessing facilities. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget reduced funding for spent fuel reprocessing but emphasized a long-term, science-based approach. President Bush recommended Yucca Mountain for a nuclear waste repository, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. An approval resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2002. President Bush signed an approval resolution in July 2002 for civilian radioactive waste disposal. Low-level waste is generated by various sources and disposed of in facilities in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. A Utah facility accepts the lowest-concentration class A waste from across the United States. Congressional authorization in 1985 led to the creation of regional compacts for low-level waste disposal, with the first new disposal site opening in Texas in 2011. The NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel for disposal. DOE missed the deadline to begin waste disposal by January 31, 1998, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. DOE settled with PECO Energy Company in 2000, allowing them to keep up to $80 million in waste fee revenues over 10 years. Other utilities sued to block the settlement. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that nuclear waste fees cannot be used as compensation for missing disposal deadlines. Utilities receive compensation from the Judgment Fund for delay-related storage costs. DOE settled 39 lawsuits with utilities, totaling $6.9 billion by FY2017. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims handles disagreements over reimbursable claims between DOE and utilities, with potential liabilities for waste program delays estimated at $34.1 billion. Utilities continue seeking compensation for delay-related costs, as DOE-owned waste stored in noncompliance could lead to fines and penalties. The DOE must charge a fee on nuclear power generation to pay for the nuclear waste program, but fee collections were suspended in 2014 after the Yucca Mountain project was halted. The nuclear industry and state utility regulators sued to stop the fee collections, arguing that the fees should not be collected while the federal government's nuclear waste disposal program is on hold. Energy Secretary Steven Chu issued a determination in 2010 that the fees must continue to be collected to cover future disposal costs. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that Secretary Chu's determination on nuclear waste fees was not valid and ordered a more thorough study within six months. DOE responded with a new fee assessment in 2013, showing varying scenarios with costs exceeding revenues by up to $2 trillion or resulting in a surplus of $5 trillion. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a review of DOE's nuclear waste fees in 2013 due to varying cost scenarios. DOE stopped collecting fees in 2014 after a court ruling deemed their waste plans too vague. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program based on previous cost estimates. DOE also filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with the NRC's ASLB in 2010, citing the Secretary of Energy's decision that the site was not viable for nuclear waste disposal. The ASLB denied the motion in June 2010, stating that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. The DOE appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC commissioners sustained the denial of the license withdrawal in September 2011 but halted further consideration due to budgetary limitations. The Court of Appeals ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application. The NRC was mandated to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application with available funding. NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report and a supplemental EIS, requiring additional funding of $330 million for the licensing review. DOE estimated its costs at $1.9 billion as the license applicant. The Trump Administration proposed to resume NRC license consideration, with DOE's FY2018 budget including $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and $30 million for NRC adjudicatory proceedings. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984, stating that nuclear waste could be safely stored at reactor sites for 30 years after closure, with a permanent repository expected by 2007-2009. Updates in 1990 and 2010 adjusted the timeline for a repository, leading to legal challenges over environmental risks. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision due to flaws in the rulemaking process. NRC approved a final rule in 2014 on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel to replace the struck-down waste confidence rule. The new continued storage rule describes environmental effects that may result from various periods of waste storage, based on a generic environmental impact statement (GEIS). The GEIS analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available: \"short-term timeframe,\" \"long-term timeframe,\" and an \"indefinite timeframe.\" The environmental impact of all three time frames was judged to be minimal in almost all categories. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected a challenge by states and environmental groups to overturn NRC's continued storage rule on June 3, 2016. The Obama Administration's termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository sparked congressional controversy, with the House supporting funding while the Senate did not. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has shifted the debate on nuclear waste in Congress. Despite concerns, the 115th Congress did not provide new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for FY2018 but the Senate not including any in the enacted appropriations bill. In FY2019, the House included $100 million for Yucca Mountain in the appropriations legislation, while the Senate did not allocate any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry on January 19, 2017, before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed her opposition to Yucca Mountain being used as a nuclear waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House on May 10, 2018, aiming to withdraw the repository site from public lands laws and place it solely under DOE's control. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed by the House aims to withdraw the repository site from public lands laws and place it solely under DOE's control. It would increase the capacity limit on the Yucca Mountain repository and allow DOE to store spent fuel at an NRC-licensed interim storage facility. The bill includes provisions for mandatory funding for repository development and future nuclear waste fee collections to offset appropriations for the nuclear waste program. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) authorizes DOE to accept spent nuclear fuel for storage at a federal or nonfederal Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility. The ownership of the spent fuel would transfer to the Secretary of Energy upon acceptance. DOE could operate its own MRS facility or make agreements with nonfederal entities to store the fuel. Prior approvals from NRC, state governors, local governments, and Indian tribes are required for MRS agreements. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities unless a federal facility is deemed quicker and cheaper to build. Energy determined that a federal MRS could be built more quickly and less expensively. Spent fuel from closed reactors would have priority for shipment to an MRS. Appropriations for an MRS would come from the general fund, not the Nuclear Waste Fund. Storage at the MRS facility would only be allowed after NRC approval for the Yucca Mountain repository or if the Secretary of Energy deemed NRC approval imminent. Construction of the MRS would halt if the Yucca Mountain repository license were revoked. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be on federal land in Nevada. H.R. 3053 would permanently withdraw the site at Yucca Mountain for a nuclear waste repository, transferring jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy. The limit for disposing of spent nuclear fuel would increase to 110,000 metric tons. NRC must issue a construction authorization within 30 months. DOE could conduct infrastructure activities before the decision. The bill would prevent DOE from developing a separate repository for defense-related waste until NRC decides on Yucca Mountain. Nuclear waste fees collection would resume after NRC's decision, limited to 90% of annual appropriations. Any uncollected fees could be paid later. Fees collected would offset appropriations, ensuring zero net appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The existing fund balance would remain available for appropriation. The bill proposes changes to the Nuclear Waste Fund, including increased annual payments to Nevada and local governments before and after spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into benefits agreements, subject to congressional appropriation, without implying consent to host the repository. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, would require the Secretary of Energy to obtain consent from affected State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a nuclear waste repository. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would oversee these functions and serve up to two five-year terms. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson would delay DOE from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a final decision on Yucca Mountain. Legislation for private-sector interim storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico has also gained congressional interest, with bills like H.R. 474 authorizing DOE to contract with privately owned storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017, similar to previous bills, would have DOE take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities. The Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) provides assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites, offering financial incentives and tax credits. The bill would establish a task force to simplify the process for communities with stranded nuclear waste and require DOE to explore options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. Concerns about spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants have led to proposed bills like the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018, which aims to move spent fuel to dry storage facilities within seven years. Emergency planning zones may need to be expanded around reactors deemed out of compliance by the NRC. The bill H.R. 4891 aims to expand emergency planning zones from 10 to 50 miles around reactors not complying with spent fuel transfer plans. It authorizes the NRC to use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants to transfer spent fuel to dry storage. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses. Senator Alexander introduced a bill to redirect the nuclear waste program, establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for storage and disposal facilities with consent from state, local, and tribal governments. The bill aims to establish a pilot storage facility for nuclear waste by the end of 2021, with a permanent repository planned by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be authorized to select sites for storage facilities for nonpriority waste only after funds are allocated for a permanent repository. Financial incentives would be offered for hosting waste facilities, with preference given to sites with both storage and a repository. Defense waste could be placed in defense-only facilities under the bill. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository on March 24, 2015. Nuclear waste fees collected after the bill's enactment would be held in a Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration could draw from the fund as needed, with the disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 on July 30, 2013. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill, while NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd called it a step in the right direction. Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed the bill due to concerns about temporary waste storage facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. H. Fettus opposed the bill due to concerns about temporary waste storage facilities and states' authority to regulate repository safety. The bill would require actions on a permanent repository before a storage facility for nonpriority waste could be sited. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 would require the NRC to maintain safety and security at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage. NRC released a study in 2013 on expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 would require the NRC to maintain safety and security at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage. NRC released a study in 2013 on expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage, concluding that the implementation costs would not be warranted due to minor safety benefits. Radioactive waste varies in characteristics, with some types decaying quickly while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive civilian waste, contains short-lived fission products. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue from spent fuel reprocessing, containing radioactive fission products and requiring isolation for 10,000 years. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements like plutonium, necessitating radiation shielding and long-term isolation. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for transuranic waste. The Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste disposal includes uranium mill tailings and mixed waste, with specific NRC concentration limits. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC for the radioactive portion and by EPA and states for nonradioactive elements. Spent nuclear fuel, removed from reactors after years of power production, is highly radioactive and consists of fuel assemblies with metal-clad fuel rods. The fuel rods, initially containing enriched U-235, undergo nuclear fission in the reactor, producing highly radioactive fission products. Some U-238 nuclei have turned into radioactive plutonium after absorbing neutrons and then splitting into fission products. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in pools of water near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. Older spent fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to shielded storage facilities. The NRC mandates that spent fuel cool for 7-10 years before being moved to dry storage. Currently, 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory store spent fuel. The U.S. nuclear power industry discharges an average of 20-30 metric tons of spent fuel per year. An estimated 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel was stored at U.S. nuclear plants by the end of 2017. The total amount of existing nuclear waste stored at U.S. nuclear plants at the end of 2017 exceeded the limit for Yucca Mountain. The amount of spent fuel will continue to grow until a storage facility or permanent repository is opened. DOE estimates that eventually, 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel may require disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. Utilities are expected to construct new dry storage facilities at reactor sites. The vulnerability of stored spent fuel post-9/11 raised concerns about potential terrorist attacks or accidents causing overheating and release of radioactivity. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time for alternative cooling measures. NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in addressing this issue. The NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers of spent fuel from pools to dry casks. Recommendations from an NRC task force post-Fukushima include ensuring electrical power and water spray systems for spent fuel pools. NRC also approved an order in 2012 for improved water-level monitoring equipment at spent fuel pools. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to disposal sites, with volumes and radioactivity varying yearly based on decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. Low-level radioactive waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for disposal. Most of the nation's Class B and C waste has been stored on-site since 2008 due to lack of a permanent disposal site. The disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility, while states can develop facilities for low-level waste. The Yucca Mountain repository was halted by the Obama Administration in 2010, but the Trump Administration is proposing to revive it in 2019. DOE issued an alternative waste management strategy in 2013. The Obama Administration issued an alternative waste management strategy in 2013, calling for a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Fund was created to pay for the program, funded by a fee on commercial nuclear power. The program was modified by the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 substantially modified the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 by designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a high-level waste repository. The law also authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility, but prohibited its selection until a permanent repository is recommended and constructed. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred responsibilities to the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy in 2010. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The commission expressed confidence in the success of this approach despite past failures in finding voluntary waste sites. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing negotiations with states and local governments. They suggested establishing a federally chartered corporation for waste management and developing a permanent repository and interim storage facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing negotiations with states and local governments. They suggested establishing a federally chartered corporation for waste management and developing a permanent repository and interim storage facilities. The commission highlighted the need for interim storage facilities to remove waste from shutdown reactor sites and prevent them from becoming de facto permanent repositories. The DOE issued a strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale facility by 2025. The strategy emphasized the importance of linking the interim storage facility to the development of a permanent repository. The DOE strategy recommended a geologic disposal facility to open by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of design and licensing by 2042. The process for selecting sites for storage and disposal facilities would be \"consent based,\" but details on implementation were lacking. The Obama Administration proposed a new nuclear waste management entity to oversee the program. The DOE proposed a new nuclear waste management entity to oversee the waste program, with details on the organization not specified. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in Congress to modify the waste program in line with the Obama Administration's strategy. Privatization of waste management services has also been suggested. A 2014 DOE report recommended testing a consent-based approach by developing a separate repository for defense and research waste, separate from civilian waste under NWPA requirements. This would reverse the long-standing policy of a single repository for both types of waste. The report recommended developing a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities. President Obama authorized planning for this repository in 2015, but faced criticism and delays. Waste Control Specialists applied for a license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for a license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners, which submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility on June 11, 2018. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with a total capacity of 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel. DOE would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. An NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Local officials support the development of waste facilities at the site, with conditions set by the state for accepting high-level waste and spent fuel. Governor Susana Martinez expressed support for the project, while the state's U.S. senators oppose an interim storage facility without progress on Yucca Mountain. Heinrich and others oppose interim storage without permanent disposal plan. WIPP incident in 2014 affects public support. Interest in waste sites in Mississippi and Texas. Bill introduced for DOE to contract with private storage facilities. DOE would take title to spent fuel at private facility. Bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas. A bill with 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas, includes provisions for a private-sector MRS facility. Previous efforts for private spent fuel storage faced challenges, such as the PFS consortium's failed project with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah. Interior Department approval was required but ultimately denied in 2006 due to concerns about indefinite waste storage. The Bureau of Land Management rejected rights-of-way for waste transport to a facility due to compatibility issues with the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a lawsuit challenging Interior decisions, leading to a court order for reconsideration. PFS later requested termination of its license. Despite efforts to redirect the nuclear waste program, current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain. NWPA mandates NRC licensing for high-level waste repositories, with EPA and DOE guidelines for siting and transportation regulations. The transportation of nuclear waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by the NRC and DOT. Shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC and DOT regulations. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include compliance with EPA standards and a performance confirmation program to ensure proper functioning of systems. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were established due to concerns about meeting EPA's general standards. The Yucca Mountain standards for radiation protection were established to limit the radiation dose on the public, based on a study by the National Academy of Sciences. The proposed EPA standards aimed to limit annual radiation doses for individuals near the repository and from groundwater exposure. EPA's standards were designed to minimize the risk of fatal cancer. The EPA finalized Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, with a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite opposition, the DOE determined the site could meet the standards. NRC revised regulations to align with EPA standards. A court later struck down the 10,000-year compliance period as inconsistent with a NAS study. The court ruled that the 10,000-year compliance period for Yucca Mountain was inconsistent with the NAS study. EPA proposed new standards in response, with a higher annual dose limit for 10,000 to 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standard as too lenient. EPA's final rule in 2008 reduced the annual dose limit for 10,000 to 1 million years from 350 to 100 millirems. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to align with new EPA standards in 2009, reducing the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for 10,000 to 1 million years. DOE estimated a maximum mean annual individual dose of 2 millirems after 10,000 years at the Yucca Mountain repository, a significant decrease from previous estimates. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposal included funding for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for generic nuclear waste R&D and integrated waste management activities. The FY2019 budget request includes funds for waste disposal R&D but zero for integrated waste management. The program focuses on reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. The Nuclear Waste Fund had fees collected for civilian nuclear spent fuel disposal costs until halted in 2014. The fund balance was $37.2 billion by FY2017. $7.41 billion was disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted. States handle low-level radioactive waste disposal under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for disposal. Under the 1985 amendments, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts after 1992. Sites in Beatty, NV, Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, are using this authority. A new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 for Class A, B, and C waste. It primarily serves Texas and Vermont but can accept waste from other states. The Texas site received its first shipment from Vermont in April 2012. Legislation for congressional consent to the Texas compact was in progress. President Clinton signed consent to the Texas compact in 1998, which originally included Maine and Vermont. However, a proposed disposal site near Sierra Blanca, TX, was rejected, leading to Maine's withdrawal. Governor Rick Perry authorized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to license disposal facilities in 2003. The Andrews County disposal facility was approved in 2011. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina is accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact. South Carolina limited the use of the Barnwell facility to compact members, with a law phasing out noncompact waste acceptance by June 2008. After failed proposals to open the site to non-compact waste, South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1995. North Carolina also withdrew in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina was not subject to sanctions. The only other disposal facility for low-level waste is in Hanford, WA, which continues to accept waste from the Rocky Mountain Compact. The NRC regulates licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities under the Atomic Energy Act. Regulations must adhere to environmental and radiation protection standards. Transportation of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. Proposed modifications to disposal regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites to ensure long-term protection. The NRC regulates licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities under the Atomic Energy Act, ensuring environmental and radiation protection standards are met. Proposed modifications aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites for long-term protection. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, with concerns heightened by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama's actions to terminate the project have led to the development of a new waste strategy through the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future halted DOE waste program activities. Congress debates the future of the Yucca Mountain project. NRC staff found the site met standards, supporting its viability. Trump Administration proposed restarting Yucca Mountain licensing. Senator Reid's retirement may impact legislative action on nuclear waste. Trump Administration requested $120 million for Yucca Mountain licensing in FY2018. Funding was not approved, but the request was repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors may seek damages from the government due to waste-disposal contracts with DOE. The nuclear industry faces potential liabilities for waste program delays, with owners of existing reactors seeking damages from the federal government. The lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could impact licensing of new nuclear plants and compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission proposed options like centralized interim storage and reprocessing to address the problems caused by delays in nuclear waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage and disposal facilities. The \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas, but cooperation from states will be crucial for success. Previous voluntary siting efforts were blocked by potential host states. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended creating a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage and disposal facilities. The report includes commissioned papers on current nuclear waste issues, government accountability on high-level nuclear waste disposal, and the economics of reprocessing vs. direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Additionally, there are evaluations of technical issues related to separate repositories for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, as well as experiences gained from managing high-level radioactive waste programs. The curr_chunk discusses various programs and reports related to managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in the United States and other countries. It includes information from sources such as the RAND Corporation, University of Illinois, and the U.S. Department of Energy. Various reports and programs related to managing high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel are discussed, including documents from the U.S. Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other sources."
