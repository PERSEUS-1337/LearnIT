    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The 1990 base closure Act expired after the 1995 round, with all actions on 451 installations completed by FY2001. Ninety-seven installations were major military bases, resulting in net savings of $16.7 billion and annual recurring savings of $6.6 billion. Additional base closures were deemed necessary due to declining defense spending and force structure. Secretary of Defense William Cohen released the Quadrennial Defense Review in 1997, calling for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001. He emphasized the need to balance infrastructure and force structure, citing a 36% reduction in force structure compared to a 21% reduction in domestic infrastructure. Cohen highlighted the importance of achieving significant savings through base closures to fund future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to initiate new rounds of base closures within the next five years faced opposition on Capitol Hill, with concerns raised about economic and political repercussions in districts. Despite efforts by Senators to push for more closures to reduce excess infrastructure and fund new weapons, the full Senate voted against the proposal, opting to delay any new base closures until accurate cost and savings measurements were developed by the DOD. The DOD was required to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner for potential base closures in 2001. Opposition in the House National Security Committee, led by Representative Joel Hefley, questioned the actual savings of base closures due to upfront costs. Congressional Budget Office could not confirm DOD's savings estimates. Senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new rounds of base closures despite opposition in Congress. Secretary of Defense Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for closures to fund weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for $2.8 billion in total savings. The Defense Reform Initiative aimed for $2.8 billion in savings through base closures, outsourcing, and reducing personnel. Support for more base closures came from a 1997 report urging quick action. President Clinton's actions regarding the base closure process were contentious. President Clinton opposed the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots recommended by the 1995 base closure commission. He directed privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in California and Texas, leading to accusations of political meddling. Legislators from other states opposed his actions. Some legislators opposed President Clinton's privatization plan for Air Force maintenance depots, fearing job losses and vulnerability to closure. Resentment over his intervention persisted, leading to efforts to block DOD's privatization plans. The House and Senate committees approved depot-related measures, but they were removed due to a threatened filibuster. Efforts to restore the provisions were unsuccessful, leading to a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the defense authorization bill. The issue remained unresolved as of early October, with neither side willing to yield. The House and Senate faced obstacles in reaching a final agreement on the defense authorization bill, with one side threatening filibuster and the other insisting on language prohibiting depot competition. A compromise was reached, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors to 50% but defining \"core work\" to be done by government depots. The House passed the conference report, and the Senate eventually agreed, leading to President Clinton signing the bill into law. In November 1997, the conference report on the defense authorization bill was passed by a vote of 90 to 10, and President Clinton signed it into law (P.L. 105-85). The bill included language prohibiting DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings from previous closures was submitted. The report was delivered to Congress in April 1998, ahead of the deadline, highlighting the need for new base closure legislation to address excess base structure and fund weapon modernization. The savings from recent base closures would fund weapon modernization and readiness. The imbalance between force and base structures was highlighted, with significant reductions in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to base facilities. The closure costs were lower than estimated, with expected savings of $14 billion through 2001 and $5.6 billion annually thereafter. The Department of Defense and General Accounting Office revised upward the estimated savings of recent base closures to $5.6 billion. The Pentagon planned two new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005, expecting additional savings of about $3 billion annually. Congress required reviews by CBO and GAO on the report's accuracy. The report recommended applying the model of previous base closure commissions and highlighted successful economic recovery in impacted communities. A controversial Air Force memo mentioned White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin Corporation to take on maintenance work at specific bases. The Administration faced strong opposition from Members of Congress regarding new base closures in 2001, with heated rhetoric and widespread resistance. The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee were divided on the issue, with the Senate committee defeating a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senators McCain and Levin were prepared to seek support for passage of a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. During Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill, an amendment was proposed to make it harder for the Pentagon to close bases. The amendment, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, aimed to restrict base closures and realignments by setting new thresholds for civilian personnel and delaying closures. Ultimately, the Senate voted 48-45 in support of the amendment. The Inhofe amendment aimed to limit base closures by setting new thresholds for civilian personnel and delaying closures. The Congressional Budget Office found DOD's estimates of savings from previous closure rounds consistent with its own estimates, but explained that actual measures of BRAC savings do not exist. The CBO review of DOD's report highlighted the lack of analysis on potential base closures and the difficulty in assessing the impact on local communities. The GAO review praised DOD for providing required information but suggested more accurate estimates of BRAC costs should include environmental and caretaker costs. GAO affirmed that previous BRAC closure rounds would result in substantial net savings, but noted DOD's report provides a rough approximation of costs and savings. DOD's data systems do not capture all savings from BRAC actions. GAO found no long-term problems affecting military capabilities due to BRAC actions. DOD's report suggests proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted similarly to prior rounds. DOD's legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a starting point for future legislation. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds of base closings in 2001 and 2003. Senator McCain highlighted the excess capacity in infrastructure claimed by DOD and emphasized the potential savings from closing and realigning bases. The bill proposed changes to the BRAC selection process and prohibited privatization-in-place in closing installations. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of further base closures to improve efficiency and save money. Despite opposition from some Members of Congress and constituents, he stated that the savings from two additional rounds of closures would amount to $20 billion during implementation and generate $3 billion annually thereafter. The Senate and House Committees rejected Secretary of Defense Cohen's call for two more base closure rounds, blocking DOD's initiative for the third year in a row. Despite attempts by Senators McCain and Levin, the Senate voted against authorizing new closures. With strong opposition in the House, it was believed that the base closure initiative had been effectively halted for the year. The Administration sought authority to close bases in 2003 and 2005, emphasizing the economic benefits of the closures. Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Congress to improve the base closing process due to bureaucratic obstacles and potential cost savings of $20 billion. Despite efforts by Senators McCain and Levin, Congress rejected authorizing new closure rounds in 2000. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, DOD aimed to secure authority for additional military base closures and realignments. Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill (S. 397) for two new closure rounds in 2003 and 2005, supported by Taxpayers for Common Sense. Estimated savings of $21 billion by 2015 were projected if bases were closed. Senator Hutchison expressed concerns about closing domestic bases prematurely due to increasing restrictions on military training abroad. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures and realignments in 2001 due to excess capacity. The proposal introduced the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001\" and a new approach based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. Brooks AFB demonstrated transferring property to the local community and leasing back needed property. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003, approved by the full Senate despite opposition. General Shelton and Secretary Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess infrastructure for war-fighting ability in light of the terrorist threat. Opponents argued against closing bases during the current war on terrorism and uncertain economy, while supporters emphasized the need to prioritize military resources for combating terrorism. The House and Senate leaders maintained their positions on base closures in the FY2002 defense authorization bill. The stalemate over base closures in the FY2002 defense authorization bill lasted for weeks, with Senator John McCain warning of a potential veto by the President. A compromise was finally reached on December 10, 2001, and the defense authorization bill was signed into law on December 28, 2001. The compromise retained most of the 1990 BRAC Act language but included some important changes and modifications. Key provisions included extending the authority for one new round of base closures in 2005 and requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit force structure plans. The 1995 base closure commission aimed to assess military installations for excess infrastructure and potential closure or realignment. It required an inventory of installations, economic analysis for reducing excess infrastructure, and certification for closure with annual savings within six years. The commission was modified in 1997 to increase members to 9, allow the Secretary of Defense to testify on proposed base additions, and prohibit privatization of closed bases unless recommended by the commission. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld gained approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005. Communities near military bases are concerned about their survival and are implementing strategies to retain their military units and potentially acquire units from other areas to ensure their base's survival in the next round. Range encroachment is a growing concern for communities near military bases. The impact of \"range encroachment\" near military bases includes urban growth, competition for air space, and protection of endangered species, which may de-value installations and make them prime candidates for closure in 2005. The 2005 BRAC timeline outlines the process for base closures, including criteria publication, nomination deadlines, and congressional approval."
