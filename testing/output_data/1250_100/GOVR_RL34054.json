    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership to build a nationwide broadband network for public safety users by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. This decision was based on the need for robust communication capabilities. The FCC proposed a public-private partnership to build a nationwide broadband network for public safety users by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. This collaboration aimed to meet public safety needs for robust communications capabilities and interoperability, while also providing new sources of funding and access to additional spectrum in times of emergencies. The FCC proposed a public-private partnership to build a nationwide broadband network for public safety users by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The commercial license known as the D Block attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, failing to meet the reserve price set by the FCC. Consequently, the FCC initiated a review of its rules regarding licensing and prepared new auction rules for the D Block. The new rules for the D Block auction maintain a single nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, while offering the commercial license as either a national license or in smaller licenses covering 58 regions. Public safety associations and officials are advocating for local public safety networks to operate on and manage access to the public safety spectrum. Congressional policy discussions are focused on combining public and private spectrum ownership to enhance national public safety communications support. The FCC and the Department of Homeland Security are pursuing separate paths for developing communication responses without fully incorporating each other's goals. The FCC and Congress are considering funding solutions for public safety networks, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. The federal government could temporarily act as the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business. Sharing spectrum with commercial users is seen as beneficial for public safety, providing new funding sources and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The benefits of sharing spectrum between public and private sectors are widely accepted, with key needs identified for an effective solution: sufficient spectrum for a broadband network, a source of funds to cover costs, and a management structure for a public-private partnership as outlined by the FCC. The debate surrounding the unsuccessful auction of the D Block license includes discussions on the need for incentives for commercial partners to build a network meeting public safety standards, flaws in the auction structure, and alternative solutions to assign the license. The debate surrounding the unsuccessful auction of the D Block license includes discussions on modifying auction rules, eliminating network sharing requirements, using federal funds to build a public safety network, and ensuring a sound business case for public-private partnerships. The FCC seeks comments on various options for managing a public safety network that shares resources with commercial spectrum-license holders. Congressional action is required to authorize expenditures and establish an organizational structure. Commissioners support re-auctioning the D Block to create a public-private partnership with increased FCC oversight. The FCC seeks comments on options for managing a public safety network through a public-private partnership. Proposed rule changes for the auction include modifying requirements for the D-Block winning bidder, re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances, and using surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network. Some suggest eliminating the network sharing agreement and offering the D Block as a commercial license. The FCC is considering using funds from auctions to build a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer federal funds for a nationwide network, but are exploring using private sector funds. Recommendations for using spectrum proceeds lack details on distribution. Some propose a cooperative organization with multiple public safety partners for managing the network. A public-private partnership is being considered to build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for public safety during emergencies. The commercial partner would require a smaller financial commitment while state and local agencies would have greater participation in building and controlling access to their parts of the network. Funds for public safety could be distributed through existing grant programs. Multiple commercial partners could be involved, with licenses for local markets and rural coverage. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and choosing technology and standards for commercial partners to follow. The FCC could set standards for network design, with federal funds used to build the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized, with a focus on competitive positions of commercial partners. A federally chartered corporation could operate the network, funded through appropriations or fundraising efforts. The FCC could establish standards for network design at 700 MHz, with federal funds used to create an interoperable backbone. A federally chartered corporation could operate the network, funded through appropriations or fundraising efforts. The Public Safety Broadband License could be retained by the Public Safety Spectrum Trust or reassigned, with laws governing corporate conduct and congressional oversight replacing FCC regulations. Congress could assist in creating a broadband network for public safety using the existing license and the D Block. The FCC seeks input on various topics related to the Public Safety Broadband License and network sharing agreements. The FCC seeks input on various topics related to the Public Safety Broadband License, including eligibility, network sharing agreements, auction of the D Block, relocation costs, service rules, and funding sources. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would borrow $197 million for capital expenditures, not including operating costs, to build a network for public safety. The FCC is exploring funding options for operating costs, including the Universal Service Fund. The FCC is exploring funding options for the Public Safety Broadband License, including utilizing the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. The TDF provides capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry through interest accrued on FCC deposits. The FCC has consistently set financial requirements for bidders and used economic incentives in auctions since 1994. The FCC establishes rules for auctions and service use licenses, including requirements for license utilization within a specific timeframe. For Auction 73, service rules were expanded to mandate spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees. The FCC created a structure for a public-private partnership in preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. The Second Report and Order discussed potential issues in building and operating a shared network. The FCC established rules for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction. The regulatory framework includes requirements for organization, performance, and compliance for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, Commercial partner, and Network Sharing Agreement. Compliance and dispute resolution would be overseen by the FCC. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use during the transition to digital television. The Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) developed standards for the band, managed licenses through regional committees, and established 55 Regional Planning Committees (RPCs). The band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz has been revised to create two licensing approaches with the support of the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC). The FCC revised the band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz to create two licensing approaches. One block is designated for narrowband applications, while the other is for broadband applications. Channels have been reassigned to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum. States and localities will administer these channels through regional committees. The networks on narrowband frequencies will be financed through a combination of local, state, and federal funds. Spectrum is also allocated for broadband communications in 10 MHz of frequencies, with two guard bands each covering one megahertz. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety radio traffic at 700 MHz to create two licensing approaches. One block is designated for narrowband applications, while the other is for broadband applications. Guard bands are created to act as buffers against interference. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan. The cost of building the national network using the spectrum held by the broadband licensee would be shouldered by its commercial partner. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit corporate status and absence of commercial interests. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST) was formed by public safety associations to receive the public safety license. Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License. The Board of Directors consists of members from public safety organizations. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint board members and allowed for four at-large members. The FCC selected organizations for the Public Safety and Homeland Security and Wireless Telecommunications boards, removing NPSTC due to membership overlap. PSST, the selected licensee, must file quarterly financial reports with the FCC and meet specific criteria. The FCC will provide oversight to ensure compliance. Various options were considered to ensure the public safety licensee receives necessary services for emergency communications. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign or revoke the commercial license for the D Block if necessary. The public safety licensee's license would be valid for ten years, renewable, with responsibilities including negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement and administering access to the network for public safety users. The public safety licensee has various responsibilities, including negotiating purchase agreements, approving equipment and applications for the network, coordinating station access, overseeing rebanding, and deciding on access for federal agencies. They also review requests for wideband networks in unserved areas. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit based on their small business status. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz, and was offered as a single, nationwide license. The reserve price for the D Block was suggested to be $1.33 billion, with a presumed value of $1.7 billion based on previous auctions. The FCC rules recommended discounting the presumed $1.7 billion value of the D Block license. The winning bidder must meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Negotiations for the NSA would begin after the bidder files its long form application. The NSA must be completed within six months and approved by the FCC. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has rights if network assets are sold or if the D Block license is cancelled. The winning bidder must file a report with the FCC within ten days of starting negotiations for the NSA. The FCC requires the winning bidder of the D Block license to file a report within ten days of starting negotiations for the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA). Good faith negotiations must be actively pursued, with detailed monthly reports after three months. Two FCC staff members must observe negotiations, and separate legal entities must be formed to hold the license, own network assets, and operate the company. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" to protect assets in case of insolvency. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would be a corporate structure comprised of quasi-independent companies, each with a designated function. These entities and any agreements created to implement the partnership would be subject to the Communications Act and the FCC's rules. Failure to meet obligations could result in revocation of the D Block license and a penalty of 10% of the auction price. The D Block license, if successfully auctioned in Auction 73, would require a penalty of 10% of the auction price. It would be valid for ten years starting from February 17, 2009, the end date for analog television broadcasts on the 700 MHz band. The licensee must comply with FCC rules to be eligible for license renewal. A commercial corporation formed as per FCC requirements would be responsible for building the public safety network using the D Block license. Build out must meet FCC and public safety licensee requirements, with possible modifications subject to approval. Benchmarks include reaching 75% of the population in four years, 95% in seven years, and 99.3% in ten years. The FCC required the D Block licensee to meet population coverage benchmarks over ten years, based on U.S. Census data. The licensee had to include a build-out schedule for highways, interstates, and communities over 3,000 people, with estimated costs for each area. Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. To enhance coverage in rural areas, the licensee had to offer a handset with integrated satellite capabilities for public safety use. The licensee also had to ensure signal robustness to meet coverage requirements and standards set by the NSA for public safety service, network performance, and reliability.

Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. To enhance coverage in rural areas, the licensee must offer a handset with integrated satellite capabilities for public safety use and ensure signal robustness to meet coverage requirements and standards set by the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) for public safety service, network performance, and reliability. The NSA serves as the keystone of the public-private partnership, with the FCC reviewing and approving all components to ensure the network meets the needs of public safety. The FCC mandates that the D Block licensee provides broadband mobile voice, video, and data with features for public safety and commercial use. The network must ensure interoperability, signal coverage reliability, robustness in harsh conditions, backup power, capacity during emergencies, spectrum efficiency, security, encryption, and real-time prioritization of public safety communications. The FCC mandates that the Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the public safety network to ensure safety requirements are met. They have the right to approve equipment specifications, purchase subscriber equipment, and negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement with the D Block Licensee. Additionally, a common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability must be adopted by all public safety users on the network. The FCC mandates that the Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the public safety network, including negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with the D Block Licensee. The NSA covers fee structure, duration, and specifies all service fees. Negotiations should be done in good faith with reasonable rates, including financial incentives for the commercial licensee and affordable rates for public safety. The goal is to serve public safety objectives established by the FCC. The FCC has tools to resolve disputes over fees charged in the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) to meet public safety goals. The NSA lasts up to ten years, aligning with the D Block license, and can be renewed or modified alongside the license. Any changes must be approved by the FCC Commissioners or Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease frequencies to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis. The D Block licensee has secondary access to transmit on public safety band frequencies when not in use by primary users. This access is part of a public-private partnership agreement, where the D Block licensee must lease spectrum and build a network for public safety use. The FCC requires a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the ten-year license term to ensure compliance and prevent interference with public safety operations. The FCC requires the network to prioritize first responders with immediate preemption of commercial users in the public safety spectrum band. Public safety has real-time emergency access to the D Block spectrum, with the FCC defining what constitutes an emergency. The FCC revised the band plan to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks for public safety. The FCC made decisions regarding public safety networks in the 700 MHz band, including requiring adjustments for networks in the preliminary stages, capping reimbursement at $10 million, prohibiting new narrowband systems, and limiting wideband networks. The band plan now includes separate paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband communications. Some states are building narrowband networks in the 700 MHz band for public safety use. The FCC mandated that frequencies be vacated by February 17, 2009, for broadband use. Motorola estimated rebanding costs at $9.45 million, with a reimbursement cap of $10 million set by the FCC. The FCC ruled that systems and radios in operation before August 30, 2007, would be covered for rebanding costs estimated at $6 million. New operations on affected narrowband frequencies were prohibited after this date to control expenses. Public safety and commercial licensees had to reach an agreement on relocation costs within 30 days to receive reimbursement. Displaced public safety network operators have 30 days to agree on a plan for reimbursement. They must provide accurate information on mobile and portable handsets, base stations, and operational areas. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only necessary costs for changes, not unrelated improvements. Some reimbursement may be available for costs related to the rebanding program. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs for changes due to rebanding, not exceeding $10 million. This amount is part of the relocation plan submitted to the FCC, with certification from all parties involved. The approved amount must be paid into a trust account by the public safety licensee before the Network Sharing Agreement is executed. Payments from the trust account can only be made after the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder. Public safety network operators seeking to operate wideband systems must obtain a waiver from the FCC. In order to operate wideband systems within narrowband frequencies, operators must obtain a waiver from the FCC. The waiver request must include various documents such as an application for authorization, confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed upon conditions of operation, a transition plan to the broadband network, and certification of no reimbursement sought for future transition costs. Wideband devices must be interoperable with the broadband network, and licenses for wideband operations are valid for five years. The FCC has taken on the role of overseeing public safety interests, emergency communications, and interoperable networks under the Communications Act. The FCC has extended its authority to oversee the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the D Block license holder. The FCC plans to enforce existing rules or create new ones for the public-private partnership, with measures including litigation or license revocation. Congress would have a role in accepting this arrangement. Two bills introduced in the 110th Congress aim to address issues related to creating a shared network. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055) would provide funding for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, with conditions set by the FCC. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465) would establish a First Responders Interoperable network. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker) aims to create a Trust Fund for First Responders to purchase interoperable radios for a new public safety network. It is linked to the auction of the D Block spectrum, with proceeds going into the Trust Fund. Additional funding would come from future auctions, with extended auction authority for the FCC."
