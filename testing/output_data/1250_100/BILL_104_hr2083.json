    "content": "The Act titled \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" allows for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995 allows for tax reduction if economic growth falls below 1.5% and national unemployment exceeds 6.5% during specific testing periods. The Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995 allows for temporary income tax reductions to provide fiscal stimulus to the economy following notification to Congress by the President. The reductions are effective for taxable years beginning in the specified calendar year, with rates in the first income bracket reduced by up to 3%. The Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995 allows for temporary income tax reductions up to 3% after notification to Congress by the President. The withholding tables will be adjusted to reflect the rate reduction, and the full effect will be seen in the calendar year through withholding adjustments. If economic growth requirements are met, a temporary surtax will be implemented in the following calendar year. In the calendar year when economic growth requirements are met, tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will increase based on a percentage determined for that year. However, tax rates for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000 will not exceed the previous year's rates. The tax tables will be adjusted to reflect these rate increases. The tax withholding tables will be adjusted to reflect the increase in tax rates for the subsequent calendar year. Economic growth requirements must be met, with GDP growth over 4.5% and unemployment below 5.5%, for the tax rate increase to take effect. The percentage increase in tax rates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is determined by the President to offset a decrease in receipts without raising rates for lower-income individuals. The percentage will be published in the Federal Register before the start of the calendar year. SEC. 3. Treatment under pay-as-you-go procedures: Any changes in receipts from this Act will not affect the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
