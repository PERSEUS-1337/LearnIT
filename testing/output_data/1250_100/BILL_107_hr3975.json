FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing past pandemics like the bubonic plague and the influenza epidemic. Disparities between rich and poor countries in HIV transmission to children are increasing, potentially reversing progress in child survival. The number of AIDS orphans worldwide is expected to triple in the next decade at current infection rates. The global infectious disease threat, particularly HIV/AIDS, is projected to increase significantly in the next decade, leading to economic decline, social unrest, and political instability in vulnerable societies. A 2000 US National Intelligence Estimate report warned that infectious diseases could reduce GDP by 20% or more in some sub-Saharan African nations by 2010. Despite these alarming statistics, some developing countries like Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand have successfully implemented prevention programs to reduce HIV infection rates. It is crucial for the US to provide financial support for medical research, education, and disease containment on a global scale to benefit all Americans. The global strategy to combat infectious diseases, including AIDS, has significant benefits for all Americans. The proposed Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund aims to allocate Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Despite international endorsement in 1997, the Fourth Amendment has not been implemented due to lack of Congressional authorization. Approval by the United States, holding 17.16% of the voting power, is crucial for combating the epidemic. The United States, with 17.16% voting power at the IMF, could receive Special Drawing Rights. The Global Fund leverages resources from donor nations to combat HIV/AIDS. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to accept the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, allowing for the contribution of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The United States Governor of the Fund accepts the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement, allowing for the contribution of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Secretary of the Treasury will seek an agreement for the Global Fund to hold Special Drawing Rights and provide contributions in fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The United States will contribute 1/3 of the Special Drawing Rights received to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Secretary of the Treasury will negotiate with other Fund members to encourage similar contributions."
