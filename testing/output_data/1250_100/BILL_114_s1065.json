    "content": "The \"School Asthma Management Plan Act\" is added to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, introducing school asthma management plans under Part D. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies to develop and implement school asthma management plans, purchase FDA-approved drugs and devices for emergency use, and provide necessary supplies for students. Grants may also be awarded to local health or education departments for the same purpose. The local educational agency or department must submit an application to receive a grant for asthma management plans. Priority is given to agencies assisting schools with high asthma burdens. Grant funds are to be used for developing school asthma management plans and purchasing emergency drugs and devices. The school must have an asthma management plan in place, including identifying students with asthma, creating individual action plans, educating staff, providing access to medication, implementing specific medication and emergency policies, and offering training for clinical management. The school must have protocols and training for managing acute asthma symptoms and ongoing care, coordination with family and healthcare providers, monitoring care quality and outcomes, and completing the EPA's Indoor Air Quality Profile. Grant recipients should use existing systems, encourage communication with physicians, and find innovative ways to improve asthma management. The school must ensure rapid communication between schools and students' physicians, encourage adherence to asthma treatment, have trained staff for emergency asthma care, include asthma triggers in student action plans, and report asthma emergency events to the State health department. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2016 and beyond. \"Part D - School Asthma Management Plans: Section 4401 outlines the requirements for school asthma management plans, including rapid communication with physicians, staff training for emergency care, and reporting of asthma emergencies to the State health department.\""
