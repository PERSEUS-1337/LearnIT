    "content": "The \"States as Energy Leaders for the Future Act\" or \"SELF Act\" defines terms like \"eligible entity\" and \"Secretary\" in relation to clean energy grant programs. The Department of Energy established a program to provide grants to eligible entities for clean energy and carbon reduction measures, including renewable electricity standards, climate action plans, use of alternative vehicles, energy efficiency in public buildings, participation in greenhouse gas reduction programs, and financing for energy efficiency improvements. The Department of Energy offers grants to eligible entities for clean energy initiatives, including grid technology improvements and carbon efficiency standards. Eligible entities must meet requirements set by the Secretary and submit an application for review. The Secretary determines grant recipients based on application information and criteria for evaluation. The Secretary will establish criteria for grants, including eligible measures and application criteria, through regulations. Considerations include regional energy disparities and clean energy potential. Grant funds must be used for specified eligible uses. The Secretary will establish criteria for grants, including eligible measures and application criteria, through regulations to ensure an objective evaluation based on specified criteria. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2011 is $5 billion for the Secretary to carry out the Act. This funding will remain available until expended. Additionally, there is a cost offset for the clean energy grant program and deficit reduction, which results from denying deductions for major integrated oil companies for income related to domestic production of oil, gas, or primary products. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows major integrated oil companies to claim deductions for oil-related qualified production activities. This change applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
