    "content": "North Korea's human rights violations have been well documented, with the Bush Administration initially focusing on them before shifting priorities. Congress has criticized the executive branch's approach to these issues, leading to legislative action like the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004. The Obama Administration's stance on addressing human rights in nuclear negotiations remains unclear. The legislation criticizes the implementation of the original law and emphasizes human rights as a major priority in U.S. policy towards North Korea. U.S. attention to North Korean human rights is complicated by geopolitical sensitivities in East Asia, with China and South Korea cautious of U.S. involvement. North Korean refugees seeking resettlement often transit through other Asian countries, raising concerns about instability or the collapse of North Korea. U.S. officials worry that criticism of Seoul and Beijing's approach to human rights violations could disrupt multilateral negotiations on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs. The Bush Administration criticized North Korea for human rights practices but did not propose negotiations on human rights during the Six-Party talks in 2007. The Six-Party Agreement called for bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea to resolve issues and move towards diplomatic relations. Observers noted a shift in the Administration's stance on human rights after the agreement was signed in February 2007. The 108th Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, authorizing funds for assistance to North Korean refugees, promoting human rights and democracy, and appointing a Special Envoy. It also emphasized the importance of human rights in negotiations with North Korea and the need for improved monitoring of humanitarian aid distribution. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 was passed by the 108th Congress, emphasizing human rights in negotiations with North Korea and providing assistance to North Korean refugees. Advocates believe it sends a strong message about the importance of human rights in U.S. policy towards North Korea, while critics argue it may strain relations with South Korea and China and worsen the situation for North Korean refugees. The NKHRA raised congressional interest in North Korean human rights and refugee issues, with existing programs in place. Activities like Korean-language broadcasting were enhanced, including the admission of North Korean refugees to the US. Reports show steps taken by the State Department to promote human rights in North Korea, with funding fulfilled through existing programs. The DRL Bureau grants support US-based organizations for democracy promotion in North Korea. The DRL Bureau grants $1 million for North Korea human rights and media freedom programs. The Special Envoy attends Freedom House conferences to raise awareness of human rights conditions in North Korea. The US government sponsors UN resolutions condemning North Korea's human rights abuses. The NKHRA impacts refugee admissions, with 71 North Korean refugees accepted for resettlement in the US. PRM Bureau funds UNHCR for assistance to North Korean refugees in East Asia. The NKHRA calls for increased Korean-language broadcasts to North Korea by RFA and VOA, funded by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The BBG currently broadcasts ten hours per day, including news briefs, interviews with defectors, and international commentary on events in North Korea. The budget request for FY2009 includes $8.5 million to maintain this broadcast schedule. The BBG conducts Korean-language broadcasts to North Korea through RFA and VOA, with ten hours per day of news, interviews with defectors, and international commentary. An InterMedia survey shows North Koreans have access to radios altered to receive international broadcasts. The reauthorization bill renews funding through 2012 at original levels to support human rights, promote freedom of information, and assist North Korean refugees. It criticizes the slow pace of executive branch implementation of the law and resettlement of refugees. The reauthorization bill focuses on U.S. efforts to process North Korean refugees and the role of the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues. It emphasizes the need for the Envoy to be a full-time ambassador-level position, with criticism directed at the previous part-time appointee. Congress also expects the Envoy to participate in policy planning and implementation regarding North Korean issues. The Obama Administration has not yet selected its Special Envoy for North Korean refugee issues. Lefkowitz's role varied in its public profile, from being an advocate for human rights to fading from public view. He attended conferences on human rights abuses in North Korea and raised concerns about labor practices at the Kaesong complex. In 2007, his visibility declined as the Bush Administration focused on nuclear negotiations. Lefkowitz's statements occasionally sparked controversy, such as criticizing denuclearization talks in 2008. In his final report to Congress in January 2009, Lefkowitz criticized some aspects of U.S. handling of refugee admissions and critiqued the North Korean policies of the South Korean, Chinese, and Japanese governments. Some observers argue that the legislation on North Korean refugee admissions could send a dangerous message to North Koreans, encouraging incursions into U.S. diplomatic missions overseas. State Department officials caution that unexpected stormings could result in injury or death for the refugees. The granting of asylum status to North Korean refugees involves a complex vetting process due to the lack of official relations between the U.S. and North Korea. Effective implementation of the NKHRA depends on various factors. State Department officials emphasize the need for close coordination with South Korea for effective implementation of the NKHRA. Funding for North Korean refugees is often labeled under general assistance programs due to the need for discretion. NGOs assisting refugees struggle to absorb large amounts of funding effectively. South Korea remains the primary destination for North Korean refugees, offering citizenship, resettlement programs, cash, and training. Over 14,000 defectors from North Korea have resettled in South Korea. Over 14,000 defectors from North Korea have resettled in South Korea since the Korean War. South Korea's refugee acceptance process is faster than the U.S. system. President Lee Myung-bak's administration has taken a new approach by tying assistance to North Korean progress on denuclearization and openly criticizing their human rights situation. South Korea has also voted for U.N. resolutions calling for improvement in North Korea's human rights practices. Lee has conditioned aid on improved access to ensure it reaches those in need. President Lee Myung-bak's administration has tied assistance to North Korean progress on denuclearization and criticized their human rights situation, leading to a chill in North-South relations. A joint statement from President Bush and President Lee in August 2008 urged progress in improving North Korea's human rights, marking the first mention of such a topic."
