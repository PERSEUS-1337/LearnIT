    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Russian-American Trust and Cooperation Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that the Russian Federation operates an intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba, leased for $100-300 million annually. The facility covers a 28 square-mile area with over 1,500 Russian personnel. The Lourdes facility in Cuba has tracking dishes and a satellite system used for intercepting communications. The predecessor regime obtained sensitive information about US military operations. Academic studies show the facility collects personal information and can engage in cyberwarfare against the US. The facility's operational significance has increased since February. The Lourdes facility in Cuba, used for intercepting communications, has seen significant growth since February 7, 1996, when Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered increased intelligence gathering on Western economic secrets. The Russian government has reportedly spent over $3 billion on the facility's operation and modernization. Former US officials confirm the expansion, and in December 1999, a Russian military delegation discussed the facility's operation in Cuba. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON BILATERAL DEBT RESCHEDULING AND FORGIVENESS FOR THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. Prohibition on rescheduling or forgiving Russian Federation's debt to the US until operations at the intelligence facility in Cuba are ceased. President can waive this with certification to Congress. The President can waive the prohibition on rescheduling or forgiving Russian Federation's debt to the US if it is deemed necessary for national interests. The President must provide a detailed explanation for the waiver and may submit the certification in classified form if needed. Every 180 days, a report must be sent to the relevant committees on the extent to which the requirements are being met. The President must report on the closure of the intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba every 120 days until a certification is made. The report will detail Russia's actions to terminate its presence at the facility and efforts by US agencies to verify these actions."
