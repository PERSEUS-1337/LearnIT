    "content": "The \"Hospital Cooperative Agreement Act\" aims to promote collaboration among hospitals to reduce costs and enhance efficiency in healthcare delivery by sharing technology and services through a demonstration program. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to up to 10 hospitals to collaborate on expensive medical technology or services. The program aims to reduce costs, improve access to care, and enhance quality. Eligible applicants must be hospitals willing to enter into cooperative agreements with other hospitals in the same state or region. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to hospitals for sharing medical technology or services. The program aims to reduce costs, improve access to care, and enhance quality. Eligible applicants must be hospitals willing to enter into cooperative agreements with other hospitals in the same state or region. The cooperative agreements will involve activities described in the application, consideration passing under the agreement, and other relevant information determined by the Secretary. Evaluation guidelines will be developed by the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and applications will be evaluated by the Secretary in consultation with the Administrator. The Secretary will consider the cooperative agreements when awarding grants. The Secretary will evaluate cooperative agreements in grant applications based on guidelines for enhancing hospital care quality, preserving facilities, improving cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, and avoiding duplication. Grant funds can only be used for collaboration expenses, not for purchasing facilities or equipment. The cooperative agreements in grant applications focus on enhancing hospital care quality, preserving facilities, and improving cost-effectiveness. Grants cover expenses for specialized personnel, administrative services, support services, and instructional programs. Additionally, a portion of the grants aim to increase access to or quality of care in rural areas through cooperative agreements. These agreements also involve sharing medical or high technology equipment and services among participating hospitals. The term 'medical technology' includes drugs, devices, and medical procedures used in care, along with support systems. Eligible services for shared agreements must have high costs and reduce excess capacity. The program lasts 5 years, with a report due after. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the potential benefits of cooperative agreements in reducing healthcare costs, increasing access to medical services, and improving healthcare quality. The report will also include recommendations for future programs. Additionally, hospitals can enter into cooperative agreements without violating antitrust laws. The Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Clayton Act, and State antitrust laws prohibit certain activities. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 to carry out this section."
