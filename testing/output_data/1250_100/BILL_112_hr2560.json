    "content": "The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011\" is also known as the \"Cut\" Act. It amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by adding discretionary spending limits. The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011\" sets discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2012 to prevent exceeding specified budget authority and outlays. Adjustments can be made for the global war on terrorism bills or resolutions. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allows adjustments for appropriations related to the global war on terrorism for fiscal year 2012, with a limit of $126,544,000,000 in budget authority and outlays. House or Senate Committees on Appropriations may revise suballocations accordingly. SEC. 317 imposes limits on direct spending in bills, excluding certain functions like Social Security and Medicare. The total direct spending for fiscal year 2012 should not exceed $680,730,000,000. SEC. 318 enforces discretionary and direct spending caps through sequestration. Implementation of sequesters involves enforcing discretionary spending limits separately and implementing direct spending sequestration according to specific guidelines. Certain payments are exempt from sequestration, including military personnel, TRICARE, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, net interest, and discretionary appropriations. Presidential orders may be modified as necessary. After issuing a sequestration report, the provisions of the Balanced Budget Act apply to bills overriding the order. A bill altering a sequestration order must achieve the same reductions in budget authority and outlays as specified in the order. SEC. 201 of TITLE II--CAP sets a limit on total spending by amending definitions related to GDP and introducing caps to enforce GDP outlay limits. The section enforces GDP outlay limits by defining the term and specifying the percentage for each fiscal year. The Office of Management and Budget determines the GDP outlay limit for the budget year, including all federal outlays. Sequestration is used to enforce this section, following the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain programs are exempt from these limits. Exempt Programs from GDP outlay limits include military personnel, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, and net interest. SEC. 320 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 enforces limits on GDP outlays, prohibiting bills that exceed these limits from being considered in the House of Representatives or the Senate. This amendment adds to the enforcement procedures outlined in the Act. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot borrow more until a balanced budget amendment is transmitted to the States, containing spending limits and requiring a two-thirds vote for tax increases. This amendment would also affect section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code. The dollar limitation in section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to $16,700,000,000,000 by Congress for ratification. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 19, 2011. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
