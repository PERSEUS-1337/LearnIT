    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period, and States must apply and meet eligibility criteria. The State educational agencies awarded grants for pilot programs must have developed alternate assessments, identified local education agencies for participation, provided guidance on student selection and assessment tools, ensured data collection, implemented response to intervention approach, and ensured monitoring and oversight. The pilot program involves monitoring and oversight of local education agencies to ensure appropriate student identification for participation. Participation is limited to 0.5% of the student population, with parental consent required for students assessed under the program. The pilot program ensures students receive quality instruction in grade-level content, assesses students' performance in reading and math, and requires examination of various data by the IEP Team to determine instructional levels. The pilot program requires the IEP Team to develop targeted interventions to address identified gaps in students' instructional and grade-level knowledge. Data from instructional level assessments cannot be used to determine proficiency levels or school progress. Local education agencies must compile reports on students' instructional level proficiency and progress. The pilot program focuses on assessing students' instructional level proficiency and progress towards grade level proficiency. State education agencies must submit annual reports on student participation and progress in closing the proficiency gap. Data collected will inform a report to Congress on changes in proficiency levels before and after participation in the pilot. Authorization of $5,000,000 for grants under this section for fiscal year 2008."
