It had a 10% tax rate and included eight tax preference items, with capital gains income being a significant one. The tax has been modified multiple times since 1969, with major changes in 1976 and 1978 leading to the creation of the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The alternative minimum tax (AMT) was introduced in 1969 as an add-on tax with a 10% rate and included eight tax preference items. Between 1978 and 1982, individuals were subject to both the add-on minimum tax and the AMT. In 1982, Congress repealed the add-on minimum tax, expanded the tax base of the AMT, and changed the tax rate to 20%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 further increased the AMT tax rate to 21%, changed the exemption amount, broadened the tax base, and introduced a phase-out of the exemption amount for high-income taxpayers. The AMT was significantly impacted by changes in the tax treatment of capital gains income under the regular income tax. The 1986 Act repealed the exclusion for long-term capital gains income, reducing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 increased the AMT tax rate to 24%. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the AMT exemption amounts for various filing statuses. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 established a two-tiered tax rate structure for the AMT, with rates of 26% and 28%. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 allowed nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset regular income tax in full for tax year 1998. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 extended the provision allowing individuals to offset their regular income tax by nonrefundable personal tax credits until 2001. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 expanded the use of certain tax credits against both regular and AMT liabilities. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 extended this provision until 2003. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 increased the basic AMT exemption amounts. The AMT exemption amounts were increased by various acts such as JGTRRA and WFTRA, with the maximum tax rate of 15% applying to capital gains and dividend income. AJCA made changes to the AMT, coordinating farmer and fisherman income averaging and allowing certain credits to be used against the AMT. TIPRA 2005 also made adjustments to the AMT. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA 2005; P.L. 109-222) increased the AMT exemption amount for 2006. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432) made the credit for prior year minimum tax liability refundable. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-28) allowed tax credits for certain purposes. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-166) set AMT exemption levels for 2007. The Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) extended the AMT patch for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) included a one-year patch for 2009. The AMT patch legislation in the 111th Congress increased exemption amounts for the 2009 tax year. Subsequent acts continued to patch the AMT for 2010, 2011, and 2012, with exemption amounts increasing each year. The AMT for individuals is calculated by adding back tax preference items to taxable income. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is calculated by adding back tax preference items to taxable income. The AMT tax base is determined by grossing up the taxpayer's regular income tax, subtracting the basic exemption, and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure. Tax preference items added to the AMT tax base include certain interest income and excess depletion deductions. Differences in depreciation rates between AMT and regular income tax calculations also impact the AMT tax liability. The taxpayer pays the greater of their regular income tax or AMT tax liability, with any excess AMT tax credit carried forward for future offset. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) adjusts the tax base by adding back tax preference items and making various adjustments, such as disallowing certain deductions and requiring specific accounting methods. Personal exemptions do not reduce the AMT tax base. The AMT tax base is not reduced by personal exemptions or standard deductions. The AMT exemption is subtracted from the tax base before calculating AMT tax liability. Exemption amounts for 2013 are $80,800 for joint filers and $51,900 for single filers. The exemption is phased out for higher income levels. Once the exemption is applied, the AMT tax liability is determined using the AMT tax rate schedule. The 2013 AMT tax rate schedule applies a 26% rate on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income, with a 28% rate on any additional income. Capital gains and dividend income are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax liability. Even if not subject to AMT, it can still impact regular income tax liability. Nonrefundable personal tax credits can offset AMT liability, with most credits allowed against the AMT starting in 2012. The 2013 AMT tax rate schedule applies a 26% rate on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income, with a 28% rate on any additional income. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax liability, with selected personal credits still allowed against the AMT for 2012. The AMT tax credit is designed to prevent double taxation of certain preference items. Before the enactment of ATRA, concerns were raised about the increase in upper-middle income taxpayers subject to AMT. The AMT tax rate schedule for 2013 applies a 26% rate on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income, with a 28% rate on any additional income. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax liability, with selected personal credits still allowed against the AMT for 2012. Concerns were raised about the increase in upper-middle income taxpayers subject to AMT before the enactment of ATRA. The lack of indexation for inflation in the AMT led to an increase in tax liabilities over time, causing many taxpayers to potentially be subject to the unindexed AMT or experience reductions in their nonrefundable tax credits under the regular income tax. The AMT has long been recognized by tax analysts, but with indexation as prescribed under ATRA, it is no longer a critical policy concern for Congress. Looking ahead to tax reform, the role of the AMT will be considered. The permanent indexation ensures lower baseline tax revenue, which is important for revenue neutrality in reform. From an economic perspective, an ideal income tax system would eliminate the need for the AMT, as all taxpayers would already be paying their fair share. The AMT was originally intended for high-income taxpayers to ensure they pay their fair share of taxes. Efforts to reform the regular income tax could eliminate the need for the AMT, but it is unlikely that the tax base will be broadened enough. Congress may need to modify both the AMT and regular income tax to maintain social and economic incentives while limiting taxpayers subject to the AMT. Changes to the tax code have increased special tax preferences for middle and upper-middle income taxpayers, leading to significant deviations in income tax liabilities within these income ranges."
