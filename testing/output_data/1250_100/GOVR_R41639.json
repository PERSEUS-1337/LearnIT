    "content": "Congress has a long-standing interest in revitalizing distressed areas through federal programs like Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities. These programs provide grants and tax incentives to businesses in economically distressed zones. A report compares the effectiveness of these programs and discusses recent legislative activity. Since 1993, Congress has authorized multiple rounds of Empowerment Zones (EZs), Enterprise Communities (ECs), and Renewal Communities (RCs) to revitalize economically distressed communities. Each program offers different benefits and eligibility criteria based on population, unemployment, and poverty levels. The Administration requested tax incentives for EZs and RCs in FY2010 and FY2011 budgets, with extensions granted until December 2011. Tax benefits for EZs and RCs were also extended through December 2009 in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended EZ tax benefits until the end of 2011, but not RCs. Legislation like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided broadband education and training for facilities in EZs and ECs. Funding was provided for EZs and ECs in 2009, with competitions held to designate communities. In three rounds, 184 communities were designated for funding through legislation from 1999 to 2009. Round I funds were available until 2004, while Round II funds are available until expended. Tax incentives expired in 2009. Four federal agencies administer the programs, with grants mainly administered by HHS, HUD, and USDA. Funding for EZs and ECs has been provided through annual appropriations and legislation like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided broadband education, training, and equipment for selected facilities in Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Enterprise Communities (ECs). HHS grants aim to prevent dependence on public assistance and promote self-sufficiency. HUD administers urban programs for economic development, including job creation and training. USDA oversees rural EZ and EC programs, targeting areas with high poverty rates. The Community Empowerment Board coordinated EZ and EC programs, involving federal agencies and the IRS for tax benefits. GAO noted its role in designating EZs and ECs, encouraging other agencies to support them. The Board was dissolved before Round III of the EZ program in 2004. EZ, EC, and RC designations required communities to meet specific eligibility criteria based on socioeconomic factors. The eligibility criteria for EZ and EC programs were based on socioeconomic factors such as poverty, unemployment, and population in nominated census tracts. Requirements varied by round, program, and urban/rural areas. Indian reservations were excluded from Round I designations. Only HUD-designated areas were eligible for tax credits. The concept of enterprise zones originated in Great Britain in the 1970s. In the 1980s, enterprise zones were established in England and the United States, with legislation introduced in Congress. By the late 1980s, over two-thirds of states had implemented enterprise zone programs. By July 1993, 37 states had established programs with different eligibility criteria and benefits. Congress authorized three rounds for Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities. The EZ and EC programs were established in 1993 through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Grant and tax incentives were provided to companies in economically distressed neighborhoods. Areas had to be nominated by local governments and states to be considered for the programs. In 1994, HHS, HUD, and USDA designated 104 EZs and ECs from over 500 communities that applied for federal grant funding. Businesses in these zones received tax credits, including wage credits, section-179 expensing, and tax-exempt financing. HUD also created Supplemental Empowerment Zones and Enhanced Enterprise Communities in addition to EZs and ECs. President Clinton authorized HUD to designate two communities as Supplemental Empowerment Zones and four communities as Enhanced Enterprise Communities under Executive Order 13005. These communities received federal grant funding of $300 million and could use the funds for eligible activities. Congress authorized two additional rounds of competitions for EZs and ECs, with grant and tax incentives provided. Round II EZs and ECs received federal grant funding through HUD and USDA appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year Ending September 2001 authorized Enterprise Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities to provide tax incentives for local businesses. Renewal Communities encouraged hiring local residents and offered incentives such as employment credits, zero percent tax on capital gains, and increased tax deductions. Additionally, public schools in enterprise communities and empowerment zones were authorized for qualified zone academy bonds. Qualified zone academies (QZABs) are bonds designated for school modernization and renovation in economically distressed areas. The federal government offers annual tax credits to bondholders instead of interest payments. QZAB holders are limited to banks, insurance companies, and corporations. Renewal community tax benefits were available until December 31, 2009, with additional incentives for the District of Columbia as an Enterprise Zone. The District of Columbia is designated as an Enterprise Zone with various tax incentives, including a wage tax credit, tax-exempt bond financing, and first-year expensing of equipment. These incentives target areas with poverty rates of 20% or more, with a zero capital gains tax rate for business sales in areas with 10% poverty rates. The incentives were extended through various acts until 2011. EZs, ECs, and RCs are eligible for tax and grant incentives to promote economic development. Tax incentives, grants, and preferences are available for EZs, ECs, and RCs to encourage economic development. The number of tax incentives has increased over time, while the value of grant incentives has decreased. Tax incentives are similar to entitlement spending and depend on program rules, economic conditions, and behavioral responses. Federal tax incentives for community development have historically focused on employment or investment incentives. Incentives for employers to hire workers are utilized by both EZ and RC programs. Both EZ and RC programs offer incentives for employers to hire workers, aiming to foster economic development in designated areas. These incentives reduce after-tax wages for employers, potentially increasing employment. The EZ and RC employment credits are calculated similarly, based on employee wages up to a cap. The Empowerment Zone credit is 20% of the first $15,000 for eligible residents, while the Renewal Community credit is 15% of the first $10,000 for eligible residents. Investment incentives are also used to promote economic development in these areas. Investment incentives under the EZ and RC programs aim to boost economic development by allowing firms to expense the cost of qualified property under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. Firms outside designated areas can expense up to $250,000, while those within can claim an additional $35,000. The commercial revitalization deduction further reduces after-tax costs for commercial construction within Renewal Communities. Expenditures on a pro-rata basis over a 120-month period beginning with the month the building is placed in service. Capital cost recovery occurs faster than standard tax rules. No depreciation allowed for amounts deducted under this provision. Empowerment zone bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds for qualified economic development projects in EZ. Round I EZ bonds subject to state volume cap, with each zone limited to $3 million outstanding. Round II EZs have lifetime caps based on urban/rural designation and population. Rural EZs have lifetime caps for EZ designation. For Round II EZs, there are no limits on borrowing amounts. Qualified RC assets held for over five years can be excluded from capital gains taxes. Taxpayers can defer gain recognition on the sale of a qualified EZ asset by replacing it with another qualified asset within 60 days. The exclusion from gross income for the sale of qualified small business stock held for more than five years can range from 50% to 75%. Grant incentives for EZ, EC, and RC programs totaled nearly $1.8 billion from 1993 to 2009, with different funding amounts provided for each round. Round III communities received tax incentives only. The Community Empowerment Board recommended preference points for EZs and ECs in federal programs, leading to benefits like economic development grants and assistance from various federal agencies. Congress also earmarked funds for projects in EZs and ECs, while programs like the Weed and Seed initiative provided support for crime reduction in these areas. The Community Empowerment Board recommended preferences for EZs and ECs in federal programs, leading to benefits like economic development grants and assistance from various federal agencies. Other communities that competed for, but did not receive, EZ or EC status received preferences for federal technical assistance programs. USDA named some communities that competed but did not win as \"Champion Communities,\" eligible for technical assistance and preferences for other government programs. Preferences for EZs and ECs sometimes came from state and local economic development programs. Legislation like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided preferences for broadband education, training, and equipment for selected facilities within ECs. The impact of these preferences is unclear due to limited reporting data, and GAO noted a decrease in preferences after the Community Empowerment Board disbanded. The extent to which applicants took advantage of these preferences is unknown. Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of EZ, EC, and RC programs, but have not found significant improvements in community outcomes. While businesses and investors benefited from program incentives, overall economic conditions for locals did not show general improvement. The cost-effectiveness of these programs has been called into question, as they have not been proven to cause widespread economic development. HUD's interim assessment of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Communities programs found mixed results regarding their effectiveness in improving community conditions. The study evaluated performance based on economic opportunity, community partnerships, sustainable development, and strategic vision for change. While some tentative findings suggested a positive impact, overall job growth accelerated in the urban EZs and ECs. The Interim Report on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Communities programs found that job growth accelerated in the six empowerment zones, with four outpacing job growth in comparison areas. The number of EZ resident-owned and minority-owned businesses also increased substantially. However, the results may not be robust due to sensitivity to comparison areas selection. Grant funding was suggested as an important factor in economic development policy, but other findings showed little to no positive impact. The general economic upturn during the study period made it challenging to separate employment growth attributable to the programs from the overall economy. Low take-up rates of tax incentives also raised questions about the impact of EZ activities on employment increases. The 2004 GAO report audited the effectiveness of EZ, EC, and RC programs, examining their impact on poverty, unemployment, and economic growth. It found that $251 million in EZ employment credits and $315 million in tax-exempt bonds were claimed between 1995 and 2001. However, due to lack of data, the report did not determine the programs' impact on community outcomes. The 2006 GAO study analyzed Round I EZ and EC designation effects on community outcomes but could not conclude that designation improved outcomes. The GAO reports analyzed the statistical significance of changes in community outcomes, highlighting the difficulty in attributing them to the EZ and EC programs. Data limitations hindered large-scale econometric evaluation, and studies by federal agencies and academic researchers found modest effects, questioning the cost-effectiveness of federal empowerment zones. Studies have found limited effects and question the cost-effectiveness of empowerment zone programs. Difficulty in isolating program effects from overall economic conditions hinders evaluation. Research shows no significant impact on income, unemployment, or poverty, similar to findings on state-level enterprise zones. Several studies have conflicting conclusions on the impact of empowerment zone programs on the housing market. Owner-occupied housing increased by 22-25% with zone designation in two studies, while another study found that renters in empowerment zones are worse off as rents rise faster than earnings. Congress has shown interest in extending and reforming these programs, with some bills proposing changes such as extending tax benefits, revising requirements, and targeting federal assistance for other programs. In the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to extend tax benefits for Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Enterprise Communities (ECs), including new grant programs and tax incentives. One bill aimed to target EZ funds to manufacturing, clean energy, and agricultural enterprises, while another would have created an Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone. In the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to extend tax benefits for Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Enterprise Communities (ECs). The proposed bills aimed to extend tax incentives for EZs and ECs through various dates, with some bills extending designations through 2019. The Empowerment Zone tax incentives were extended through December 31, 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The expiration of the tax incentives in 2009 led to pending projects being put on hold until the programs were renewed. The Obama Administration requested Congress to extend the benefits in both FY2010 and FY2011 budget documents. In the 111th Congress, legislation focused on addressing unemployment by extending Empowerment Zone (EZ) tax incentives. The bills aimed to revise job creation criteria and eliminate residency requirements for EZ tax credits. Proposals also sought to amend the process for designating EZ boundaries. In the 111th Congress, legislation aimed to expand Empowerment Zones (EZ) boundaries and modify eligibility requirements to encourage more businesses to establish projects in distressed communities. Critics argue that geographically targeted incentives may lead to the redistribution of business activity rather than the creation of new economic opportunities. In the 111th Congress, legislation aimed to expand Empowerment Zones (EZ) boundaries and modify eligibility requirements to encourage more businesses to establish projects in distressed communities. Critics argue that geographically targeted incentives may lead to the redistribution of business activity rather than the creation of new economic opportunities. Advocates of adjusting the geographic boundaries of EZs, ECs, and RCs argue that economic distress changes over time and census tracts that previously met thresholds may no longer qualify. Legislation proposed changes to tax and grant incentives in EZs, ECs, and RCs, including allowing carryovers of unused expensing allowances for EZ businesses and permitting tax-exempt rural EC bonds and EZ facility bonds. In the 111th Congress, legislation aimed to expand Empowerment Zones (EZ) boundaries and modify eligibility requirements to encourage more businesses to establish projects in distressed communities. Governments would have been permitted to issue tax-exempt rural EC bonds and EZ facility bonds to finance projects and provide federal guarantees and tax exemptions for eligible businesses located in EZs and RCs. Legislation also proposed establishing a program for grants to States to establish revolving loan funds for small and medium-sized manufacturers to improve energy efficiency and produce clean energy technology, as well as providing tax credits for farmers' investments in value-added agriculture. H.R. 3500, the Small and Medium Urban Regions Growth and Empowerment Act of 2009, would have expanded the use of tax-exempt Gulf Opportunity Zone and facility bonds in such areas and authorized grants to make businesses aware of tax benefits in enterprise zones. Several bills have proposed adjusting, changing, and increasing tax and grant incentives for EZs, ECs, and RCs. In the 111th Congress, bills proposed adjusting tax and grant incentives for EZs, ECs, and RCs to stimulate economic activity in distressed areas. Critics raise concerns about potential challenges in coordinating federal efforts and increasing the federal deficit. H.R. 5296 and S. 3373 introduced new legislation unrelated to EZ programs. The legislation proposed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency would designate areas as air and health quality empowerment zones, eligible for grants to replace or retrofit polluting vehicles. Critics question the effectiveness of these programs, while supporters argue they provide resources to economically distressed areas. The lack of evaluation information remains a challenge. In a 2010 report, the GAO found that economic conditions improved in communities where these grants and tax benefits were used, but isolating their impact is difficult without proper evaluation. The impacts of EZ/EC/RC programs on distressed communities are unclear without linking tax benefits to specific areas. Congress has options to consider, such as extending the programs or letting them expire, which could affect economic recovery and fiscal outlook. The fragmented national economic development policy, resulting from years of initiatives without unifying principles, may hinder effective federal efforts. Supporters argue that the numerous programs allow for targeted policy tools, while detractors believe the lack of clear goals renders current efforts ineffectual. Detractors argue that the lack of clear goals in federal economic development policy hinders effectiveness and oversight. They suggest consolidating or replacing existing programs with a unified set of principles to better target areas in need of development. Detractors suggest consolidating or replacing existing economic development programs with a unified set of principles for more effective targeting of resources. The current reliance on unemployment or poverty rates may not efficiently allocate economic development resources. Metrics like foreclosure rates, retail vacancy rates, or long-term unemployment rates could lead to better targeting. GAO reports indicate challenges in program oversight due to data limitations, recommending increased oversight measures. Congress could retain existing programs but realign economic development efforts to areas with the greatest need for assistance. The GAO recommends increased oversight for economic development programs to allow for proper evaluation by Congress.
