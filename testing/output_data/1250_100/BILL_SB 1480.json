    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15 each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements, including assessing any capital investments for expansion. The assessor may audit the operations of the property owner to verify eligibility for welfare exemption. If property is found ineligible, the claimant can seek a refund through the county or file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption for property exempted under specific sections is not required to reapply if there are no changes and the property is used by a governmental entity or nonprofit. The applicant must notify the assessor if they become ineligible or no longer own the property by February 15. The assessor will send an annual notice to those exempt from filing. The notice provided by the board, in consultation with the California Assessors\u2019 Association, informs applicants about circumstances that may make their property ineligible for exemption. It also advises them to inform the assessor if the property no longer qualifies for exemption. Additionally, the notice outlines the procedure for reaffirming exemption eligibility for the next fiscal year under specific sections, emphasizing that failure to do so does not automatically waive the exemption but may prompt further verification by the assessor. Upon indication of incorrectly granted welfare or veterans' organization exemptions, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel exemptions if necessary. Incorrectly allowed exemptions will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty. The board will review the assessor's administration of exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow counties, cities, and municipal corporations to apply for a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by the board. Applications must be submitted in writing by November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. The board will provide notice and a hearing upon receipt of a timely application. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being barred from relief. Section 4674 is also amended regarding the reassessment of incorrectly granted welfare or veterans' organization exemptions. Any excess proceeds from delinquent tax sales remaining after distribution under specified sections can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. Unclaimed excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period, with deductions for certain administrative costs."
