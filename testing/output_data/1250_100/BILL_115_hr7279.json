    "content": "The \"Water Infrastructure Improvement Act\" defines key terms like \"Administrator\" and \"municipality\" and introduces the concept of integrated plans for water pollution control. Integrated plans are developed in accordance with EPA guidelines and offer municipalities the opportunity to incorporate them into permits. The \"Water Infrastructure Improvement Act\" allows permits to integrate an integrated plan addressing various requirements under the Act, such as sewer overflows, sewer systems management, stormwater discharge, and water quality limitations. The integrated plan may include water reclamation projects and green infrastructure implementation. Compliance schedules are also outlined. The permit issued under the \"Water Infrastructure Improvement Act\" may include a compliance schedule for implementing actions to meet water quality-based effluent limitations over multiple permit terms. The schedule must be authorized by state water quality standards and comply with specific regulations. Compliance with statutory deadlines does not prevent the implementation of water quality-based effluent limitations over multiple permit terms. The schedule of compliance can be reviewed when incorporated into a permit. The permit issued under the \"Water Infrastructure Improvement Act\" may include a compliance schedule for meeting water quality-based effluent limitations. The schedule can be reviewed at permit renewal to consider modifications. State authorities can authorize compliance schedules in permits that incorporate provisions of an integrated plan. The \"Water Infrastructure Improvement Act\" permit may include a compliance schedule for water quality-based effluent limitations. State authorities can authorize compliance schedules in permits that incorporate provisions of an integrated plan. In conjunction with enforcement actions related to municipal discharges, the Administrator shall inform municipalities of the opportunity to develop an integrated plan. The Administrator can modify administrative orders or settlement agreements for municipalities with integrated plans. A report to Congress is required within 2 years on integrated plans developed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act since 2012, detailing control measures, costs, and compliance schedules. The Municipal Ombudsman office is established within the Environmental Protection Agency to provide technical assistance to municipalities for compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Ombudsman ensures that municipalities are informed about available federal financial assistance, flexibility under the Act, and the opportunity to develop an integrated plan. The Municipal Ombudsman will share information on technical and financial assistance, flexibility, and resources related to integrated plans under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Additionally, they will publish permits, orders, or judicial consent decrees implementing integrated plans. Green infrastructure is defined as measures using plant or soil systems, permeable pavement, or other surfaces to manage water pollution. The Administrator is tasked with promoting green infrastructure integration into permitting and enforcement, planning, research, technical assistance, and funding guidance. Coordination efforts with federal agencies, governments, and the private sector are also required to increase the use of green infrastructure. The Administrator directs regional offices to promote green infrastructure integration through outreach, training, and incorporation into regulatory programs. Information-sharing efforts aim to assist governments, tribal communities, and the private sector in implementing green infrastructure for water pollution reduction and resource protection. The Administrator directs regional offices to promote green infrastructure integration for reducing water pollution, protecting water resources, complying with regulations, and achieving environmental goals.
