    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) and the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS), which provide the infrastructure for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons operations and is subject to Congressional oversight. Congress reviews Department of Defense's plans to sustain and modernize the NCCS, with potential changes to its structure due to evolving threats from countries like China, North Korea, and Iran. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is crucial for supporting the President's authority over nuclear weapons operations. It faces potential changes in structure due to evolving threats from countries like China, North Korea, and Iran. The NCCS includes platforms serving secondary roles for other user agencies, which may conflict with recommendations to retire Cold War platforms. Despite its strategic and budgetary implications, the NCCS is not well understood outside the military establishment. The NCCS forms the National Military Command System (NMCS), prioritizing support for the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The National Military Command System (NMCS) provides command and control of the armed forces, including nuclear and conventional forces. It includes command nodes like the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) as backup in case of ground-based command center destruction. The NMCC monitors nuclear forces and military operations, while the NAOC serves as an airborne backup for command and control capabilities. The NAOC aircraft, based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, is a modified Boeing 747-200B with hardened communications against EMP. USSTRATCOM provides personnel for day-to-day administration, while the GOC at Offutt AFB serves as a backup for essential emergency actions. Site-R in Maryland can be activated as an alternate NMCC location. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) is a fleet of modified Boeing 707 aircraft with a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel. Each team is led by a Senior Controller who is always a full Colonel or Captain. The ABNCP can serve as a survivable airborne backup if the USSTRATCOM GOC is unable to fulfill its role. The aircraft can communicate launch codes directly to ICBM launch facilities and serve as the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile operations. The E-6B aircraft serves as the TACAMO relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines, deploying a trailing wire antenna for communication. The ABNCP can also communicate using UHF or EHF satellite systems. The USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) is a convoy of trucks that serves as a road-mobile backup. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is designed to support the President's decision-making for strategic nuclear forces, including situation monitoring. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) includes monitoring strategic intelligence from classified and open sources, as well as tracking weather for aircraft operations. Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) centers quickly detect and analyze potential attacks using \"dual phenomenology\" to provide critical information for decision makers. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) utilizes dual phenomenology, involving satellites and radars, to verify attacks. Decision making involves consulting with senior commanders and advisors for nuclear weapon employment. Force management ensures readiness of nuclear deterrent forces, providing crucial data for decision makers. Force direction includes nuclear command and control aspects like nuclear surety. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) focuses on nuclear surety and positive control to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons and ensure instructions to launch reach forces. The NCCS must be survivable in extreme conditions and reliable to support rapid decision-making. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) must prioritize mobility, redundancy, and concealment, while also being reliable and secure. Security measures are crucial to limit access to authorized personnel, prevent interference, and protect against potential adversaries with asymmetric capabilities. Nuclear command and control is central to the deterrence construct, as highlighted in the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review directed by Congress. The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) focuses on the policy requirements for maintaining a safe nuclear deterrence posture, including the relationship between deterrence policy, targeting strategy, and arms control objectives. It also addresses the levels and composition of nuclear delivery systems, the nuclear weapons complex, and the stockpile needed for national and military strategy implementation. Assistant Secretary Crouch highlighted changes in the multinational environment as a driving factor for the NPR, emphasizing the new relationship with Russia post-Cold War. The NPR emphasizes the need for a new relationship with Russia post-Cold War and a reduced dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence. It also addresses emerging threats from WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles. The \"capabilities based approach\" aims to provide a wider range of options for the President to tailor the national response to potential adversaries. The NPR introduces a \"new triad\" of capabilities including nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, active defenses, and passive defensive forces. The NPR introduces a \"new triad\" of capabilities including nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, active defenses, and passive defensive forces. The Administration emphasizes command, control, intelligence, and planning at the center of the new triad to enhance precision, adaptability, and integration of forces for improved deterrence and operational effectiveness. This focus on NC2 capabilities could lead to new systems initiatives. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense have implemented the framework of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). USSTRATCOM has taken on additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. Organizational changes continued in 2005, with USSTRATCOM designated as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. These additions to USSTRATCOM's mission portfolio reflect the post-Cold War environment outlined in the 2001 NPR. The Department of Defense has started incorporating the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) into its doctrinal guidance for military commanders. There were plans to update the \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005, focusing on deterring and responding to weapons of mass destruction threats. The new joint doctrine would emphasize rapid crisis action planning in response to WMD threats, aligning with the 2001 NPR's principles. The nuclear plan development process may need to be expedited by enhancing computer workstation capabilities and communication networks at nuclear command centers. This would enable quicker integration of plans with other military operations, similar to conventional air forces' daily tasking orders. Networked collaborative planning systems are becoming more common, and senior leaders are increasingly relying on video-teleconferencing for decision-making. Effective communication with intelligence providers for WMD target updates is crucial. The Secretary of Defense appointed a commission to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2. The commission is tasked to submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The NPR suggests using non-nuclear weapons for missions previously allocated to nuclear weapons, but the presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal is likely to continue. The policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons is not addressed in the NPR, which could impact the required command and control architecture. The current nuclear command and control systems were developed during the Cold War to manage a potential nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. However, as the post-Cold War environment brings new requirements, it raises questions about the appropriateness of the existing infrastructure. This could lead to the need for new programs and investments in order to address evolving threats. During the Cold War, concerns about a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership shaped upgrades to nuclear command and control systems in the 1980s. The focus was on ensuring government control of nuclear weapons even during an attack, leading to increased redundancy and survivability of communication links. Today, the threat of such an attack from Russia is considerably diminished compared to the Cold War era. The U.S. relationship with Russia has evolved from being adversarial during the Cold War to a more cooperative stance. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, signed in 2002, aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons significantly. Despite the decline of the Soviet Union, analysts believe the U.S. could face various challenges in the future, including a potential nuclear threat from China. China's military expenditures are increasing, with a focus on acquiring more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM. China's military expenditures are increasing, with a focus on acquiring more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM. General Zhu Chenghu threatened to attack U.S. cities with nuclear weapons if the U.S. aids Taiwan against China. Analysts have differing views on the China threat, with some suggesting China is striving for preeminence in the Pacific Rim, while others argue the threat is overstated. Kurt Campbell highlighted that the U.S. relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and there are areas of cooperation. Some believe the emphasis on a \"China threat\" is a search for a great power peer competitor since the end of the Cold War. Some analysts argue that the increasing Chinese nuclear capability, along with hostile relations or diplomatic crises, could pose a renewed threat to the nuclear command and control system. Rogue states like Iran and North Korea, pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology, reinforce the need to maintain a viable NC2 architecture. North Korea has been actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability since the 1960s, with A.Q. Khan possibly aiding Kim Jong Il's efforts. North Korea claimed to have nuclear weapons in 2005, but without a nuclear test, the claim is difficult to verify. North Korea's nuclear program is estimated to possibly have ten bombs, with uncertainty about their missile delivery capabilities. Reliable information from inside the country is scarce, and there are doubts about the accuracy of North Korean claims. The Iranian nuclear program is also a concern, with projections suggesting they are about ten years away from acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran's nuclear program is a concern as intelligence analysts project they are roughly ten years away from having atomic bomb capability. Some predict Iran could have nuclear weapons sooner, with Israel suggesting within two years. Iran's activities at nuclear sites have raised suspicions, with concerns about developing long-range delivery systems and ties to military studies on high explosives essential for nuclear weapons. Iran's nuclear program raises concerns about potential threats to the United States, including the use of a high-altitude nuclear explosion to cause widespread infrastructure damage. This could lead to catastrophic failures in critical systems, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from nuclear weapons was established by Congress to address these risks. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to analyze the EMP threat, which could be used by China, North Korea, and Iran as a strategy against the US. There are concerns about the potential use of high-altitude nuclear bursts or emerging technology to generate localized EMP effects. However, there is also skepticism regarding the scope of the EMP threat. Some analysts believe that military and commercial systems may withstand an EMP burst with minimal effects, as key infrastructure and military systems have EMP protection. The motivation for China to use EMP against the US is unclear, with potential retaliatory consequences. There are doubts about North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program progress due to limited technology sharing. Developing a nuclear weapon for a large area EMP attack is considered extremely difficult for rogue states or terrorist groups. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems to EMP. The nuclear command and control infrastructure may need to be improved to address new challenges, including integrating nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces and defensive forces. The nuclear command and control system may need improvements to accommodate new challenges, such as involving additional participants in decision-making and response processes. Implementing NPR recommendations could increase demand for capacity and require faster response times, especially for non-nuclear strikes. This includes conventional attacks on strategic targets and non-kinetic options like information operations and special operations forces strikes. The determination of \"release authority\" for these options remains a key question. The President's involvement in directing non-nuclear or non-kinetic options in military operations is a topic of debate. While historically Presidents have not been heavily involved in planning specific conventional missions, there may be instances where their personal involvement is warranted, especially for strategic or critical targets. Requiring Presidential authorization for these strikes could be challenging to enforce. Presidential authorization for non-nuclear or non-kinetic military strikes may pose technical and operational challenges. The complexity increases when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could have strategic impacts, potentially equivalent to a WMD strike, requiring careful Presidential involvement and control. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation. Approval processes may need to be revised to prevent delays in decision-making and implementation, ensuring critical targets are not missed. Limited defensive capabilities may necessitate decisions on which locations to defend. In some scenarios, a decision may be needed on what locations to defend and what not to defend. Delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander, with standing Presidential guidance, is recommended to avoid missing chances to stop incoming missiles. Choosing between defensive launch or offensive strike as the national response may require Presidential consideration. Choreographing offensive and defensive conversations is crucial for decision-making in limited time frames. Defensive responses may impact offensive responses, while overwhelming defensive systems may prioritize earlier offensive responses for damage limitation. In the decision-making process after detecting a potential attack, including defensive responses will involve multiple command centers. USSTRATCOM leads missile defense but must coordinate with regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM. General Cartwright ensures interoperable missile defense systems. Adding participants to decision conferences for missile defense will strain networks. The nuclear command and control system must present choices for Presidential decision in a clear and understandable manner. It should facilitate the Commander-in-Chief's interactions with advisers and aid in decision-making within tight timelines. Maintaining tight Presidential control of nuclear weapons and ensuring clear and actionable orders to weapons operators is crucial. Additionally, nuclear command and control systems may have value beyond nuclear operations for other military and government functions. The nuclear command and control systems have value beyond nuclear operations for other military and government functions. These systems provide tight security, robust decision-making, and communication capabilities that make them versatile national assets. They support non-nuclear military forces direction, status monitoring, crisis management, and coordination of response efforts during emergencies like natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Command and control assets like the National Military Command Center and NORAD played crucial roles in coordinating response and recovery activities after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The NMCC and Mountain in Colorado played key roles in coordinating air traffic restoration after the 9/11 attacks. These assets are crucial for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush utilized USSTRATCOM in Omaha and U.S. Northern Command for monitoring and communication during crises like Hurricane Rita. Nuclear command and control assets can support civil authorities for consequence mitigation post-disasters. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have agreements in place for utilizing assets like the National Airborne Operations Center. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft, is available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. It was used during Hurricane Opal in 1995 and is valued for its versatile situation monitoring and communication capabilities. Secretary Rumsfeld relied on the NAOC for support during official travel. Using NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and potential competition for access during crises. Tying these systems to other agency functions, such as FEMA, adds to the organizations with interests in their continued viability. The continued viability of military systems, even after they are no longer needed, can impose costs and burdens on operators. The changing nature of threats and recommendations from the Nuclear Posture Review raise questions about the requirements for today's systems. In 2001, a committee was tasked with reviewing the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, considering new technology and potential threats. Former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft chaired the commission. The End-to-End Review highlighted concerns about the degradation of NC2 system hardening and the need for maintenance. It also recommended shifting life cycle management to operators to ensure operator requirements are met in new systems or modifications. The acquisition community faces challenges in meeting operator-generated requirements for NC2 systems, as they may be unrealistic or exceed budget constraints. The focus on technical capability often overlooks total costs of sustainment. Additionally, there is a decline in the number of people with NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War. The legacy NC2 architecture faces challenges due to a lack of expertise and the Defense Department's shift towards military transformation. USSTRATCOM has established subordinate functional component commands for specific mission aspects, leading to decentralization of activities away from headquarters. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes significant changes in NC2 programs to facilitate USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. The review recommends retiring expensive legacy mobile platforms, such as the E-4B NAOC aircraft, and procuring C-32 aircraft as replacements. The new command and control capabilities must be survivable in the event of WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks. USSTRATCOM is exploring an IP-based communications architecture for integrating new organizations involved in WMD elimination. However, the use of IP networks for nuclear command and control raises concerns about message transmission assurance and bandwidth limitations. The military has seen a significant increase in communications capacity requirements, with the nuclear community facing competition for command and control links due to dispersed operations concept. The military is exploring an IP-based communications architecture for integrating new organizations involved in WMD elimination. Concerns arise regarding message transmission assurance and bandwidth limitations in nuclear command and control using IP networks. Increased communications capacity requirements are seen, with dispersed operations concept leading to competition for command and control links. Coordination of new centers and systems, certification, configuration management, and reconciliation of procedures in a distributed architecture are key for avoiding chaos. Upgrades and enhancements to existing systems, rather than new procurements, are prevalent in DOD's budget requests for the nuclear command and control system. The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) comprises physical communication links. The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) is being upgraded with $20.5 million for procurement and $57.3 million for research and development in FY2006. Congress authorized these amounts in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. Modernization efforts include upgrades to data rate terminals, secure computer terminals, and satellite communications for nuclear command centers. For FY2007, DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. The MEECN program is upgrading satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers in the upper Midwest US. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is directing upgrades to the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R, consolidating command centers into two new facilities in the Pentagon for tracking global crises and providing military advice to the President. These new centers will be more survivable and secure against threats. The Defense Department is consolidating functions to create efficiencies and reduce manpower, requesting funding for planning and system engineering. Additionally, they are seeking funds to develop a future system for missile warning and attack assessment. Congress has authorized funding for these efforts in FY2006 and FY2007. The Defense Department is requesting funds for further research and development in FY2007, including enhancements to airborne nuclear command and control platforms. The budget request includes funds for modifications to aircraft structures, propulsion, fuel systems, and more. The Navy is proposing upgrades for the E-6B aircraft, including improvements to the on-board network, transition to digital UHF radio, precision navigation upgrades, and mission system enhancements. The modifications would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for these upgrades in FY2006. The Navy is proposing upgrades for the E-6B aircraft, including improvements to the on-board network, transition to digital UHF radio, precision navigation upgrades, and mission system enhancements. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for these upgrades in FY2006. The Defense Department is requesting funding for E-6 modifications procurement and research and development for FY2007. The Advanced EHF communications satellite acquisition is a controversial aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs, aiming to replace the aging MILSTAR constellation with higher data rates and capacities. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the AEHF program. The Air Force's AEHF program faced schedule delays and cost overruns due to technical shortfalls in communications encryption equipment development. The first launch is now set for 2008, with the program estimated to cost over $7 billion, a 20% increase. The AEHF program cost has increased to over $7 billion, prompting a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. It aims to bridge MILSTAR and TSAT programs, incorporating advanced technologies like laser communication cross-links. Congress considered acquiring additional AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites in case of TSAT delays. The AEHF program cost has increased to over $7 billion, prompting a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. Congress approved $436-plus million for TSAT, with $120 million reserved for either a fourth AEHF satellite or continued systems development. The nuclear command and control system faces challenges due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy. The system's legacy Cold War architecture may compete for budget priority against more immediately relevant systems. The NCCS's key functions will likely remain requirements as long as the US maintains a nuclear deterrent. The Defense Department is focusing on modernizing the nuclear command and control system, facing challenges in a budget-constrained environment. Questions arise about the nature of threats from countries like China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, impacting the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy and command and control. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy is a topic of debate, with some advocating for reducing their role for non-proliferation efforts, while others want to increase their utility to confront proliferators. This debate also extends to the command and control system, with questions about the appropriate architecture for the NCCS and the need to incorporate additional command and control requirements. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, may be more suitable for the current threat environment and could lead to long-term manpower and budget savings. However, the effectiveness of a distributed, network-style approach to nuclear command and control remains untested. The need for investment in modernizing nuclear command and control systems is being debated, with questions about the adequacy and value of existing platforms. As the services look to replace equipment worn out from duty in Iraq, the NCCS may face competition for funding against immediate service needs. The potential for short-term savings with the retirement of certain platforms is being considered, while the value of secondary uses of the NCCS is also being assessed. Additionally, as homeland security and disaster response missions gain more attention, some platforms could have increased utility beyond their primary mission requirements. The debate surrounds the justification for continued investment in modernizing nuclear command and control systems. Consideration is given to transferring procurement and operation of these systems to civilian agencies if primary mission requirements are surpassed."
