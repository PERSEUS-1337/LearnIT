    "content": "Nuclear weapons will continue to be crucial for U.S. security policy, but maintaining current Cold War-era weapons is becoming challenging. Congress faces the decision of extending the service lives of current warheads or developing a new generation without testing. The report compares these options in terms of congressional goals, costs, risks, and benefits. The possibility of resuming nuclear testing, suspended since 1992, is also discussed. The United States has not conducted a nuclear test since 1992, but some argue for resuming testing to ensure the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons. However, the Administration and Congress prefer not to resume testing. The current stockpile of warheads, mostly from the 1970s and 1980s, requires ongoing maintenance due to component deterioration. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established in 1993 to maintain nuclear capabilities. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) aims to preserve the core competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons by advancing relevant science to maintain confidence in U.S. warheads without nuclear testing. NNSA requests $6,511.3 million for SSP for FY2008, including the Life Extension Program (LEP) to replace components of warheads. Concerns about maintaining high confidence in current warheads led to the initiation of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program in 2005. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and their components. NNSA collaborates with DOD through the Nuclear Weapons Council to develop military characteristics for new warheads or modifications. Safety is the top priority, followed by security/use control. Other priorities include certifiability, cost, longevity, manufacturability, reliability, survivability in nuclear environments, and yield. Congress has outlined policy goals for RRW, including reducing the need for nuclear testing. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to meet various goals such as reducing the need for nuclear testing, improving safety and use control, designing for manufacturing and maintenance, and reducing costs. The Nuclear Weapons Council selected a California design in March 2007 as the first RRW, known as WR1, to sustain U.S. nuclear weapons without testing. The Navy-led RRW POG is currently in Phase 2A, focusing on design definition and cost study. The decision between LEP, RRW, or a combination will shape U.S. nuclear weapons for years to come. Congress will need to decide on moving RRW to Phase 3, with uncertainty in the FY2008 budget cycle. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommended holding RRW in Phase 2A in FY2008, while the energy and water appropriations bill provided no funds for RRW. Key issues include cost, technical uncertainties, and the future Complex design depending on LEP or RRW. Claims about RRW being cheaper, safer, and more reliable lack substantiated numbers. Many in Congress want NNSA to use FY2008 for further Phase 2A work on nuclear warheads, while others advocate for studying broader strategic policy issues. Calls have been made for a revised U.S. nuclear weapons strategy before committing to new programs, with proposals for a congressional commission on U.S. strategic posture and a revised nuclear posture review. The authorization bill calls for a revised nuclear posture review to include plans for warhead replacement or modification. Congress may delay RRW in Phase 2A until the next President reviews U.S. nuclear policy. S. 1914, Nuclear Policy and Posture Review Act of 2007, requires nuclear policy and posture reviews by specific dates and bars funds for RRW until these reports are submitted. Some recommend continuing R&D on RRW. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger supports research and design of RRW. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger supports research and design of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, emphasizing the need to strengthen infrastructure. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act aims for the first production unit of RRW in 2012, but there are doubts about meeting this deadline. Barry Hannah, Chairman of the RRW POG, considers the 2012 target date optimistic. The Nuclear Weapons Council memorandum in March 2007 set a target for the First Production Unit of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) for 2014. Delays in moving RRW to Phase 3 could impact the FPU date. Goals for RRW include a more efficient Complex, increased confidence in long-term reliability, and wider performance margins. Designing an RRW with greater resistance to unauthorized use, easier manufacturing, and increased performance margins aims to maintain expertise and reduce long-term costs. To improve the efficiency of nuclear warhead production, work can be done outside high-cost buildings, reducing waste streams and increasing productivity. Designing warheads for easier manufacturing and maintenance can save money by reducing process steps and equipment. Congress has not clearly defined whether the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) is considered a \"new warhead,\" leading to ambiguity in program goals. The goal of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program is to develop replacement components for nuclear warheads and ensure the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems. The ambiguity lies in the definition of \"weapon\" and \"new,\" with the need for a re-engineered and remanufactured warhead for existing weapon systems in the stockpile. NNSA cannot meet RRW goals by modifying current warheads due to design considerations from the Cold War era. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to develop replacement components for nuclear warheads, addressing design considerations from the Cold War era. The program faces challenges in making minor changes to the nuclear explosive package (NEP) without compromising design requirements. Supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) are generally critical of RRW, highlighting key points of contention between the two approaches. Raymond Jeanloz, a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and advisor on national security, supports some objectives of the RRW program but has concerns about its implementation. RRW supporters question aspects of its designs, but they are not necessarily critics of Life Extension Programs (LEP). Los Alamos has found successful RRW designs that enhance margin, surety, and manufacturability without opposing LEP strategies. They are committed to providing advice and service based on decisions made by the Administration, Congress, and the Department of Defense. The report discusses terminological notes regarding the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, emphasizing the need to replace existing warheads while addressing congressional goals. External reviews of the program are planned, including an independent peer review by the JASONs to evaluate competing RRW designs against legislative requirements. The JASON review of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program assessed the feasibility of designing and deploying a new nuclear warhead without underground testing. The report was due on March 31, 2007, with a preliminary report submitted in January, an executive summary in September, and the final report in October. The Nuclear Weapons Complex Assessment Committee studied whether RRW is the best approach for addressing potential risks. The study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) examined the feasibility and implementation of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program in addressing risks of Stockpile Stewardship Program and Life Extension Programs. The report discusses competing designs and goals set by Congress, presenting arguments from supporters of both LEP and RRW. The United States has maintained its weapons without nuclear testing by using nonnuclear experiments, computer simulations, and data analysis to ensure warhead performance. While annual assessments confirm safety and reliability, concerns exist about potential decreases in confidence over time due to repeated Life Extension Programs. Critics argue that minimizing changes and advancements in science should keep warheads reliable. Congress aims to avoid testing through the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to minimize the need for nuclear testing. Critics argue that the lack of a nuclear test \"pedigree\" reduces confidence in RRWs. Some believe that certification using the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) may lead to false conclusions as it was not validated with nuclear tests. Former LANL Director Siegfried Hecker suggested that nuclear testing would increase confidence in new tools and remanufacturing techniques. A Sandia report discusses reliability. The Sandia report defines reliability for a nuclear warhead as the probability of achieving the specified yield across various environments throughout the weapon's lifetime. Designers of the RRW aim for high reliability by maximizing margins to account for material deterioration or defects. The Sandia report discusses the importance of maintaining warhead reliability by addressing material deterioration and defects. RRW advocates foresee challenges in maintaining existing warhead reliability as systems age. LEP supporters argue that current warheads remain reliable based on stockpile assessments. Both sides agree on the need for continued understanding and improvement in nuclear stockpile performance. Richard Garwin, IBM Fellow emeritus, believes that confidence in the reliability of existing legacy weapons will increase over time. Steven Fetter questions if the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) will improve reliability, highlighting potential birth defects or reliability issues. The JASON RRW report raised concerns about certifying WR1, stating that further development is needed for the certification plan. NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino mentioned that certification without new underground testing is not assured but is a possibility. Certification of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) is a reasonable expectation without new underground testing. An integrated certification plan will be completed if funded by Congress. Independent sources have raised concerns that must be addressed before proceeding with the RRW. Some doubt the reliability of both Legacy Extension Programs (LEP) and RRWs without testing due to potential functionality issues. Certification of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) without new underground testing is questioned due to potential functionality issues with Legacy Extension Programs (LEP). Margins, uncertainty, and confidence play a crucial role in understanding the risks of implementing RRW or LEP without nuclear testing. Margin is the excess performance built into the design to ensure warhead operation, while uncertainty arises from imprecise knowledge of design parameters. Confidence is the ratio of margin to uncertainty, with high margin and low uncertainty leading to high confidence. The relationship between margins, uncertainties, and confidence is formalized in Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU). The nuclear weapons program utilizes the Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) framework to assess confidence in weapon performance without testing. Warhead designs incorporate margins to mitigate performance risks, with current missile warheads focusing on maximizing yield while minimizing weight. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) prioritizes margin, safety, and use control over yield per unit of weight. Confidence is gained through statistical metrics derived from nuclear testing data, allowing for assessment without actual testing. The labs use nuclear test data to ensure primary functionality, adjusting designs to exceed minimum margins for added confidence. Design teams prioritize margin increase in competing designs to compensate for uncertainties without testing. Critics of RRW suggest maintaining margins through component remanufacture, emphasizing the importance of primary margin adjustments for certain warheads. Critics of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) express concerns about potential uncertainties and \"birth defects\" in new designs, citing a 1996 Sandia study on stockpile surveillance. Supporters argue that Life Extension Programs (LEPs) can also introduce defects. Legislation required NNSA to commission a study by the National Academy of Sciences on Quantification of. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is conducting a study on the Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties for the nuclear stockpile. The study aims to assess if this method can be applied to the Reliable Replacement Warhead program to reduce the need for underground nuclear testing. NAS plans to deliver an interim report in March 2008 and a final report in August 2008 to NNSA and Congress. Key issues for nuclear weapons include the primary boost energy and energy transfer to drive the secondary successfully. The competing designs for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program stayed close to past experience and rejected design concepts that fell outside validated parameters from prior nuclear testing. The RRW/CA design has undergone nuclear testing and draws on over 100 other tests to ensure proper performance. Certification tools developed by the RRW/CA team boosted confidence in the design, while advocates of Life Extension Programs argue that existing warheads have been extensively tested and stay within validated design parameters. Resuming testing is a point of contention, with Stockpile Stewardship Program being a key factor in the debate. The debate over Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) testing revolves around the validation of the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) and concerns about deviations from tested designs. Advocates of RRW argue that it builds on a tested design with added margin to avoid deviations, while Life Extension Programs (LEPs) introduce slight changes that may lead to deviations. Certification plans outline the process to certify a warhead design to the Department of Defense (DOD), with past development involving computation, experiments, and nuclear testing. The RRW design teams focused on certifying LEPs and the design process together, emphasizing potential failure modes early on. They made design choices based on nuclear test data analysis to improve performance parameters and ensure robust performance even in the face of unexpected failure modes. This approach allowed for easy certification through the QMU approach, utilizing various SSP tools like hydrodynamic facilities. The teams used hydrodynamic facilities to test warhead resilience in various scenarios. LANL conducted its first hydrodynamic shot in 2006, confirming design predictions. RRW aims to replace faulty components with new ones, while NEP components must closely match originals. RRW's modern design and manufacturing processes make certification easier compared to NEP. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) aims to create a certified warhead without testing, facing skepticism from experts about meeting performance standards and extending current warhead lifespan. The challenge lies in maintaining confidence in altered parameters without new test data, requiring careful analysis and scrutiny. The standard for RRW's success is convincing leaders without new testing, with some experts expressing criticism towards the present approach. The present nuclear weapon stockpile contains 8 types with 100 successful yield tests. Critics question replacing tested devices with untested ones and the design of devices that can't be yield-tested. Some argue for nuclear tests to maintain confidence in the U.S. arsenal, while supporters of RRW and LEP point out the complexity of the link between fielded warheads and nuclear tests. Design teams prioritize safety and control in their designs. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are responsible for designing the nuclear explosive package with inherent safety features. Sandia National Laboratories is responsible for nonnuclear components and integration into the warhead. While all stockpile weapons meet safety requirements, nuclear detonation safety cannot be assured in abnormal conditions where the nuclear safety design is breached. Warheads lacking design features for the \"Trinity condition\" may produce a nuclear yield. The Trinity condition refers to the risk of accidental nuclear detonation in warheads. Some designs require a Trinity exception from the Department of Defense, while others, like the NM design, use optical isolation to meet the condition. Critics argue that current warheads are safe enough and that the risk of accidental detonation is low due to lessons learned from past accidents. Use control features in warheads ensure authorized use and prevent unauthorized access. The 9/11 attacks led to a shift in security measures, with a focus on denying access to warheads to counter terrorist threats. This change has increased security costs at nuclear weapons sites significantly. The design teams for nuclear weapons sites are incorporating new safety and use control features to reduce physical security costs. LLNL and LANL have developed designs with unprecedented and revolutionary levels of use control. However, adding these features can increase cost and manufacturing complexity, potentially impacting reliability. Some question the necessity of all features. Enhanced use control is crucial for the Air Force, especially for ICBM warheads. Enhanced use control features are important for the Air Force, particularly for ICBM warheads. Despite concerns about reduced reliability, these features offer more security options in case of accidents or attacks. Testing these features can build confidence in their value, and they may not negatively impact field operations. It is too early to determine if any safety and use control features should be dropped. Some critics question the need for more use control in current warheads and external physical security measures. Upgrading physical security or reducing weapon storage sites can improve use control. Some suggest redirecting funds to secure Russian warheads and nuclear materials. Others advocate for increasing safety and use control, even willing to resume nuclear tests for this purpose. Technology advancements may limit potential safety improvements without nuclear testing. C. Paul Robinson, then Director of Sandia, stated in 1999 that advancements in technology offer opportunities to enhance safety design of nonnuclear systems of nuclear weapons. While improvements can be made without nuclear testing, some innovative designs for safety and use control may be limited without testing. Insensitive high explosive (IHE) is safer than conventional high explosive (CHE) used in warheads, reducing the risk of accidental detonation. The first Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), WR1, aims to replace some W76 warheads with a design that includes Insensitive High Explosive (IHE) for improved safety. Supporters of RRW highlight the advantage of using IHE, which is less sensitive than CHE but requires more IHE to initiate a nuclear explosion. While the W76 uses CHE, a switch to RRW would necessitate the use of IHE. Despite the safety benefits of IHE, supporters of the W76 Life Extension Program (LEP) argue that the W76 has a strong safety record with no accidental detonations since 1978. They believe that the drawbacks of switching to RRW outweigh the safety benefits of IHE. The labs prioritized \"physics first\" in designing warheads, focusing on minimizing weight by using hazardous materials and hard-to-manufacture components. With the emergence of SSP and LEPs, collaboration with plants increased to meet congressional RRW goals for ease of manufacture and cost reduction. Design teams worked on making warhead designs safer, easier to manufacture, and environmentally friendly, aiming to reduce waste streams and improve worker safety. The RRW design aims to reduce hazardous material usage and radioactive waste, improving worker safety and environmental impact. Both RRW teams focus on simplifying manufacturing processes and expect to eliminate 1/3 of production steps. Critics argue that LEPs could achieve similar goals by retaining existing pits, while RRWs may require new pits for missiles. Nonnuclear components in both designs could use safer materials, and NNSA could enhance waste reduction efforts for LEP support. Pantex aims to simplify processes to reduce worker radiation exposure and waste. Safety requirements have increased, potentially limiting throughput. The use of Insensitive High Explosives (IHE) in RRW designs improves safety and allows for operations in bays instead of cells. LLNL's new process for fabricating RRW pits reduces radiation waste and worker exposure. The CA design replaces hazardous materials with non-hazardous ones. Safety concerns are higher for LEPs than RRWs. \"Optical isolation\" improves manufacturing safety. Pantex faces challenges with electrostatic discharge detonating CHE. NM design includes \"optical isolation\" to prevent direct electrical detonation paths. The RRW program aims to improve safety in nuclear weapon operations by implementing design attributes that eliminate hazardous materials, simplify processing steps, and reduce disassembly requirements. \"Optical isolation\" is a key feature that enhances manufacturing safety by interrupting direct electrical detonation paths to warhead detonators. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board acknowledges the potential for significant safety improvements with RRW, although certain design attributes may introduce new hazards that need to be addressed. The RRW program aims to improve safety in nuclear weapon operations by implementing design attributes that eliminate hazardous materials, simplify processing steps, and reduce disassembly requirements. Critics argue that LEPs may also increase safety by manufacturing and replacing fewer components, requiring less disassembly and reassembly. Safety practices at Pantex have been improved to handle high explosives more safely, such as reducing manual lifting of explosive components and changing solvents to prevent accidents. The Pantex plant has a good safety record due to increased focus on safety culture. They have not had any ESD events causing death or serious injury. Design priorities include minimizing assembly steps and relaxing tolerances to simplify manufacturing and reduce costs. CCRDs facilitate manufacturing by reducing rejected units and increasing throughput. The new process for manufacturing RRW pits using CCRDs reduces manufacturing time, cost, and floor space. It utilizes a direct casting process that simplifies assembly and disassembly, reduces the number of assembly steps, and eliminates bottlenecks, increasing manufacturing efficiency. LLNL proposes replacing a major component for warheads with a new-design RRW component to increase manufacturing efficiency. Using less hazardous material simplifies manufacturing. Critics argue that LEP may offer efficiencies, with a study estimating minimum pit life at 85-100 years, deferring the need for pit production. Manufacturing improvements for warhead components can be made equally for LEP or RRW. Ease of manufacture for RRWs compared to LEPs depends on the warhead being life-extended. The practice of removing warhead units for surveillance and maintenance imposes a burden on the Complex, Air Force, and Navy. Both competing designs aim to reduce this burden by implementing improved surveillance techniques and using calibrated shelf life units. These units experience the same environments as fielded warheads, aiding in the assessment of aging phenomena. The competing designs aim to reduce the burden of warhead surveillance and maintenance by implementing improved techniques and using calibrated shelf life units. They are considering embedding sensors inside warheads to gather data on environmental conditions and deterioration, which would increase data collection without the need for disassembly. The designs also focus on ease of disassembly throughout a warhead's service life. Critics raise concerns about the ease of maintenance and potential issues with data collection from onboard sensors in the RRW warhead design. They question the effectiveness of embedded sensors in identifying material incompatibilities and suggest conducting accelerated aging tests to address these concerns. The critics also worry about the reduced surveillance of warheads under the RRW surveillance plan. The RRW surveillance plan may reduce the surveillance burden by examining fewer warheads each year, but it also decreases the sample size for reliability estimates, lowering confidence in reliability. RRW may offer some longevity benefits by using materials with longer expected life and making surveillance and disassembly easier for problem detection and repair. However, RRW's long service life is not a primary focus compared to LEP, and it may not significantly improve warhead longevity. RRWs could potentially stay in service for two to three decades, similar to current warheads, making RRW longevity less relevant. NNSA developed the LEP Program to extend the stockpile lifetime of warhead components by 20-30 years. The Navy has high confidence in the W76 LEP. Experts believe SSP, surveillance, and LEPs can continue to extend the life of warheads. Supporters of LEP argue that as SSP improves, the ability to predict and resolve problems will also improve. The WR1 warhead, designed to match the yield of the W76, would be placed in the Mk5 aeroshell for accuracy. It aims to replace existing warheads for current missions without relying on new nuclear effects or principles. It is not a low-yield \"mini-nuke\" or a bunker buster, and is not tailored for new missions. The design goal is to fulfill W76 mission requirements without the need for new warheads. The W76 warhead, first deployed in 1978, is the most numerous in the stockpile. To maintain U.S. deterrent force, using RRWs, life-extended W76s, and W88s is crucial. The goal is to have the ability to modify existing warheads for new missions and respond to potential future threats. RRW designs aim to package the military capabilities of the W76 into a design that can be used in the Mk5 aeroshell, maintaining the same weight and characteristics of the W88. Supporters of the W76 Life Extension Program (LEP) argue that it is a cost-effective way to provide SLBM warheads needed for the stockpile. They believe that the W76 LEP, scheduled for production in FY2007, will extend the warhead's life by 30 years and maintain its effectiveness. The program includes changes to increase margins and compensate for uncertainties, making it a suitable option for the Navy's needs. Supporters argue that Replacement Warhead (RRW) would complement Life Extension Programs (LEPs) well. RRWs designed for post-Cold War requirements could potentially meet congressional goals without nuclear testing. The decision to replace current warheads with RRWs depends on the success of the RRW program, perceived need for nuclear weapons, and support from Congress and the Administration. The Air Force questions the effectiveness of LEPs. The effectiveness of Life Extension Programs (LEPs) is questioned due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of refurbishing current warheads. Components are made with outdated processes and materials, leading to concerns about reliability and corrosion over time. Critics doubt the Department of Defense's confidence in the ability of the Complex to execute LEPs as a long-term sustainment strategy. The President approves the number of U.S. warheads annually in the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum, with the number of deployed warheads depending on perceived military and political needs. DOD retains nondeployed warheads to hedge against technical and geopolitical risks, such as defects in existing warheads or the inability to manufacture new warheads quickly. Supporters of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) argue that they could reduce the need for nondeployed warheads due to increased reliability. Supporters of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) argue that they could reduce the need for nondeployed warheads by increasing reliability and ease of surveillance, disassembly, and manufacture. RRWs designed for one delivery system could be used on another, providing backup options for different types of delivery vehicles. LEP supporters argue against the need for many nondeployed warheads as a hedge against technical problems, believing surveillance and life-extension programs can address issues effectively. They suggest that too few RRWs would be built to arm both intended and alternate delivery vehicles, leading to concerns about geopolitical risks. Additionally, they express worries about the consequences of reducing the nondeployed stockpile sharply and the potential failure of a single warhead type. Congress has long been concerned about the size, efficiency, and cost of the Complex, with questions arising on how RRW and LEP will impact its upgrade and skill base maintenance. Analysts have highlighted the poor condition of production plants, some dating back to World War II. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld emphasized the need to repair the aging nuclear infrastructure to increase confidence in deployed forces, eliminate unneeded weapons, and mitigate risks of technological surprise. General James Cartwright stressed the importance of upgrading the nuclear weapons infrastructure for safety, security, and reliability. Thomas D'Agostino highlighted the goal of addressing stockpile problems within 12 months of discovery to meet responsiveness targets. The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board's Task Force and NNSA have proposed plans to fix issues in the nuclear weapons complex within 12 months of discovery. Both plans involve consolidating fissile material, eliminating redundancies, and reconfiguring the Complex by 2030. Supporters of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) argue that it would lead to a more efficient Complex by simplifying production and increasing throughput at Pantex. Supporters of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) argue that it would lead to a more efficient Complex by simplifying production and increasing throughput at Pantex. LEP's supporters note that NNSA routinely upgrades the Complex to support LEP, with funds allocated for infrastructure improvements. Supporters of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) question the dismantling of warheads to build facilities for RRWs, suggesting it may be more efficient to maintain existing warheads. They argue that modernizing the Complex around RRW may reduce its capabilities and increase the risk of failure in the nuclear stockpile. DOE, NNSA, and Complex staff believe RRW is necessary to maintain skills in the Complex, while LEP does not. The RRW program is essential for maintaining skills in the Complex, unlike LEP. RRW focuses on overall weapon design, not just component replacement. It allows for the development of safety, security, and control features, which LEP cannot do. Sandia emphasizes the importance of exercising all skills required for designing complete systems regularly to address high-priority issues effectively. Livermore and Los Alamos agree that the RRW program aims to enhance the nuclear weapons complex's ability to respond to unforeseen issues by enabling easier manufacturing, certification, and maintenance of warheads. This approach allows for the replacement of problem warheads with more reliable ones, reducing the need for a large inventory of reserves. NNSA advocates for a continuous cycle of design and deployment to maintain a skilled workforce capable of meeting current needs. LANL and NNSA prefer a continuous cycle of RRW design and production to exercise Complex capabilities and maintain a skilled workforce. RRW design skills are better exercised compared to LEP, as designers must balance various tradeoffs simultaneously. LEP advocates argue that it also exercises skills and ensures minor changes do not create problems in the warhead. The production and certification expertise required for life extension programs (LEP) ensure safety and reliability of warheads. LEP proponents argue that maintaining inactive warheads is a more timely hedge than relying on a Complex in transition to produce Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs). Supporters of RRWs claim they are easier to maintain long-term, but argue for their ongoing replacement, while LEP advocates suggest NNSA could maintain design and production capabilities by designing new warheads in small quantities without deployment. Supporters of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs) argue that designing new warheads in small quantities, without deployment, can avoid reliability risks and production costs. They believe this approach is more cost-effective than a skill maintenance program for small builds. RRW proponents emphasize the use of safer and less costly materials, ease of manufacture, and lower surveillance costs. The total cost of the RRW program is still unknown due to various factors affecting cost, such as design details and the number of warheads to be procured. The RRW program aims to reduce surveillance costs by having fewer basic designs and modifications, using embedded sensors for condition reporting, enhancing use-control features for security, and increasing design margins for tolerance to flaws. This approach should lower maintenance costs, ease disassembly, reduce hazardous materials, and provide more predictable costs compared to Life Extension Programs. The RRW program aims to reduce surveillance costs by having fewer basic designs and modifications, using embedded sensors for condition reporting, enhancing use-control features for security, and increasing design margins for tolerance to flaws. LEPs argue that maintaining warheads with existing experience is more predictable and cost-effective, reducing manufacturing costs, training expenses, and postponing warhead retirement. LEPs consume a small fraction of the total stockpile stewardship budget, while RRW supporters doubt significant cost reductions. Advocates of LEP question when potential savings from RRW will outweigh initial costs, citing uncertainties in a AAAS report. They express concerns about the need for additional RRWs in response to unforeseen threats potentially eroding any savings from reduced nondeployed warheads. They argue that adjusting costs and savings for net present value could delay cost-effectiveness. Additionally, they suggest that subsequent LEPs of a current warhead may be less costly due to shared resources from previous certifications. They also highlight potential maintenance costs for RRWs with defects. The Air Force's costs for maintaining non-deployed warheads are mainly fixed and not directly related to the quantity of weapons on hand. The storage of nuclear weapons drives the size of the security force, not the number of weapons. There are uncertainties regarding the cost-effectiveness of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, with questions about the 30-year life-cycle projection and the need for additional RRWs in response to unforeseen threats. The discussion focuses on the cost implications of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program and the future of the U.S. nuclear weapons enterprise. Various goals such as reliability, longevity, safety, and security come with associated costs, with design constraints and complexities adding to the overall expenses. Congress is advised to closely examine the cost section of the RRW report mandated in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. The discussion highlights the complexity and cost implications of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. Congress is urged to review key design tradeoffs and consider whether current warheads are sufficient in terms of safety and use control. The Department of Defense (DOD) has shown mixed support for RRW, with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review giving it a mild endorsement. Congress, along with NNSA, the Air Force, Navy, and others, must decide on the level of safety and use control they want and the tradeoffs they are willing to accept. The U.S. Strategic Command strongly supports the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) as a key to transforming the aging Cold War nuclear weapons stockpile. Some concerns raised by DOD components include potential changes to handling procedures and links between missile and warhead if RRWs are introduced. Current warheads are certified to work, and Life Extension Programs (LEPs) are expected to extend their life by 20 to 30 years. Some argue for RRWs to extend warhead life by 20 to 30 years, while others question the need for RRWs and suggest that LEPs can achieve the same goal. The debate revolves around the confidence in current warheads, with RRW advocates emphasizing design reliability and wider margins, while LEP advocates highlight nuclear test pedigrees and improved understanding of weapons science. There are concerns that both LEPs and RRWs break the link to testing, leading some to advocate for a return to nuclear testing for stockpile confidence. A mixed RRW-LEP force could be inevitable for some years if the US moved to an all-RRW stockpile, lowering the risk of stockpile failure. Congress may need to consider maintaining a reliable stockpile, deploying a mixed LEP/RRW force, and the implications of a test moratorium or resuming testing. Current warhead designs are preliminary, with potential manufacturing challenges and design defects. Congress may inquire about gaps between current designs and actual warheads. The plutonium shell is a key component of a weapon, surrounded by explosives. Production of pits for the stockpile ceased in 1989, with LANL's PF-4 building now producing W88 pits. Plans to increase production capacity to 50 certified pits per year by FY2012. Pit life is a factor in choosing between RRW and LEP, with recent studies extending the estimated pit life considerably. The assessment reviewed by the advisory group found that there is no degradation in the performance of warhead primaries due to plutonium aging, with most types having credible minimum lifetimes exceeding 100 years. Remanufacturing pits without nuclear testing is difficult and costly. Extending the life of existing pits could lead to high confidence in their reliability, reducing the need for new pit production and lowering costs for Life Extension Programs (LEP). RRW supporters argue that RRW offers advantages over LEP, such as safety, use control, and skill maintenance. They believe RRW pits will cost less to manufacture and increase DOD's confidence. Despite pit life findings, NNSA argues for more production capacity for pit replacement in aging stockpiles. The need for substantial production capacity to introduce RRW warheads into the stockpile by 2030 is emphasized, with concerns about potential geopolitical threats or technical issues requiring rapid warhead manufacturing. LEP supporters challenge this, citing the JASON study's findings on pit replacement and the slow pace of RRW deployment due to new pit designs. They argue that the assumption of RRW introduction justifies a new pit facility, enabling an acceptable deployment pace. LEP supporters believe that retaining current warheads and using LEP and Stockpile Systems programs can avoid the need for RRW and a new pit facility, reducing costs and risks. On the other hand, RRW supporters argue that a new pit facility would allow for the production of multiple pit types simultaneously to address potential technical or geopolitical threats. Since PF-4 was completed in 1978, it might be more cost-effective to build a new facility than to upgrade it. Pit production capacity is crucial for RRW deployment, with supporters suggesting the use of certified pits from retired warheads to expedite the process. LANL considered pit reuse for RRWs but ruled it out for missile warheads due to safety and certification issues. Pit reuse for RRWs is being considered to make limited pit production capacity available for the first RRW. Thomas D'Agostino of NNSA mentioned examining pits from dismantled warheads for future RRW concepts, especially for bombs. Reusing pits with known features could offset expenses and improve margin, safety, and use control. Warheads on ballistic missiles present size constraints, requiring a different approach. Some opponents suggest increasing PF-4's capacity beyond 50 pits per year by reconfiguring production equipment. Significant Finding Investigations (SFIs) address defects found during warhead surveillance, with some defects discovered one to two decades after production. The text discusses significant defects found in warheads one to two decades after production, with conflicting interpretations on whether they arise from aging or are present from the start. Questions are raised about the reliability of deploying new warheads like RRW and the potential risks of introducing new defects. Congress is urged to inquire about the aging process of warheads and the effectiveness of surveillance in detecting defects. The NNSA is updating the 1996 SFI review to study warhead aging and responses over the past decade. The report describes nuclear weapons design, operation, and production, including the two-stage design of current strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. The primary stage contains a pit with fissile material surrounded by explosive material that triggers a nuclear chain reaction when compressed. The nuclear explosive package consists of plutonium atoms undergoing fission, boosted by injecting a mixture of deuterium and tritium gases to increase fission yield. The fusion reaction generates energy and boosts the fission chain reaction. The primary, radiation case, and secondary components release the energy of a nuclear explosion. Thousands of nonnuclear components are also required for military usability. The nuclear explosive package consists of plutonium atoms undergoing fission, boosted by injecting deuterium and tritium gases. Nonnuclear components are needed for military usability. Components like arming, firing, and fuzing systems, an outer case, and connections link the bomb to an airplane or warhead to a missile. The nuclear weapons complex includes government-owned contractor-operated sites like Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Y-12 Plant, Kansas City Plant, Savannah River Site, Pantex Plant, and the Nevada Test Site. These sites are involved in disassembly, inspection, and refurbishment of existing nuclear weapons under the National Nuclear Security Administration. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages the nuclear weapons complex and program through the Stockpile Stewardship Program, created in 1994. The program aims to preserve US nuclear weapons expertise through advanced capabilities, experiments, and facilities. It includes Directed Stockpile Work on weapons, Campaigns for scientific expertise, and focuses on refurbishment, modifications, R&D, and dismantlement. The Stockpile Stewardship Program funds infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites, aiming to improve the reliability and certifiability of existing weapons. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program was initiated in FY2005 to enhance weapon reliability and longevity, with Congress setting goals for the program. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program, established under P.L. 109-163, aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. It also seeks to reduce the likelihood of underground nuclear weapons testing and ensure the ability to produce replacement warheads that are safer and more cost-effective. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to develop safer, more cost-effective, and reliable replacement warheads to reduce the size of the nuclear weapons stockpile. It utilizes modern design techniques and materials to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the arsenal. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to develop safer, more cost-effective, and reliable replacement warheads for Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles. It also focuses on increasing warhead design margin, manufacturability, and maintaining human capital expertise in the nuclear complex. The program's goals include enhancing the security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile, developing replacement components with more environmentally friendly materials, and ensuring the expertise of weapons designers and engineers for future stockpile maintenance.

The program's goals include enhancing the security and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile, developing replacement components with more environmentally friendly materials, and ensuring the expertise of weapons designers and engineers for future stockpile maintenance. The committee supports these goals and a modest investment in feasibility studies to substantially increase the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile with the ultimate objective of achieving the smallest stockpile consistent with national security. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to develop safer, more cost-effective, and reliable replacement warheads for Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles. The program's goals include reducing the need for nuclear testing, dismantling weapons, reducing reliance on nuclear weapons, decreasing costs, increasing security, and ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The House Appropriations Committee supports an accelerated approach to implement a new nuclear weapons paradigm. The House Appropriations Committee supports an accelerated approach to implement a new nuclear weapons paradigm with the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, aiming for a smaller, more efficient nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for nuclear testing. The program's goal is to design a more reliable replacement warhead for existing systems, not for new production or military missions beyond current deterrent requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee supports the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program to explore the possibility of designing replacement components for existing stockpile weapons with more environmentally friendly materials and increased safety and reliability without nuclear testing. The program aims to reduce life-cycle costs for supporting the stockpile while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the legacy stockpile. The FY2005 provision for the RRW program requires weapon design to meet military requirements and past nuclear test parameters. The NNSA is expected to improve manufacturing practices and reduce costs to support the Administration's nuclear stockpile reduction. The FY2007 committee reports did not add new requirements for RRW design."
