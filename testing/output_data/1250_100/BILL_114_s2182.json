    "content": "The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" is also known as the \"Cut\" Act. It modifies the Congressional Budget Act by adding spending limits. The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" sets spending limits for fiscal year 2016 to prevent exceeding specified budget authority and outlays. Adjustments can be made by the House or Senate Committee on the Budget for enforcement purposes. The House or Senate Committee on Appropriations may report revised suballocations for the new budget authority in a bill for fiscal year 2016. If appropriations are designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, adjustments for fiscal year 2016 cannot exceed $58 billion in budget authority. SEC. 317 imposes spending limits on bills in the House and Senate, with exemptions for certain functions like Social Security and Medicare. SEC. 102 enforces these caps through sequestration. Implementation of sequesters involves separate sequestration for discretionary and direct spending, following specific sections of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain payments are exempt from sequestration, including military personnel, TRICARE, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, net interest, and discretionary appropriations. Presidential orders can be modified as needed. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for modifications to Presidential sequestration orders. Bills or resolutions overriding the order must achieve the same level of budget reductions. A point of order is in place to ensure any modifications meet the required reductions. Title II of the Act amends definitions related to total spending limits, including the term 'GDP'. Additionally, Title III is amended to enforce GDP outlay limits. Title III of the Act enforces GDP outlay limits, which are determined based on projected GDP for each fiscal year as estimated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The GDP outlay limit percentages decrease gradually from 19.9% in fiscal year 2016 to 18% in fiscal years 2021 to 2025. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget establishes the GDP outlay limit for the budget year, which includes all federal outlays. Federal outlays, both on-budget and off-budget, are subject to sequestration under section 254 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain programs such as military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, and net interest are exempt from sequestration. SEC. 320 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prohibits considering any legislation that would exceed current GDP outlay limits. This amendment adds enforcement procedures to ensure spending limits are not surpassed. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot borrow more money until a balanced budget amendment is sent to the states, requiring total outlays not to exceed total receipts, a spending limit as a percentage of GDP, and tax increases to be approved by a 2/3 vote in Congress. It is not allowed to consider any legislation causing additional borrowing until the balanced budget amendment is transmitted to the states."
