    "content": "REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR WETLAND RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION EXPENSES: Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on wetland restoration and conservation expenses. The tax code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for wetland restoration, conservation, and easement expenses. The wetland restoration credit is based on expenditures for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state, approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The wetland conservation credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for wetland conservation expenses, including the Conservation Reserve Program rental rate and certification fees for compliance with conservation agreements. The applicable percentage for the wetland conservation credit ranges from 50% to 70% based on the term of the conservation agreement. If a taxpayer elects the wetland easement credit, the wetland conservation credit for that year is zero. The wetland easement credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim the fair market value of qualified wetlands subject to a conservation easement. The wetland easement credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim the fair market value of qualified wetlands in agricultural use through a certified appraisal. An election under this subsection applies to the taxable year for which it is made. Eligible taxpayers must own property consisting of wetlands, farmed wetlands, or prior converted wetlands, along with surrounding actively farmed cropland, and have entered into a qualified conservation agreement or easement. The term 'qualified wetland' refers to wetlands being converted to fully functioning condition through restoration expenditures, along with surrounding nonwetland areas for water quality or wildlife habitat buffering, not exceeding 3 times the wetland acreage. Excludes land receiving contract or easement payments. In the taxable year, contract or easement payments are received from the Conservation Reserve Program or the Wetlands Reserve Program under the Food Security Act of 1985. The terms 'wetland', 'farmed wetland', and 'prior converted wetland' are defined by the Act. A 'qualified conservation agreement' is an agreement with a governmental unit for 10-30 years, where the taxpayer agrees to comply with conservation requirements for the qualified wetland. A qualified conservation agreement requires the taxpayer to obtain certification of compliance every 5 years. Conservation requirements include not using the wetland for agricultural production and refraining from draining, dredging, or manipulating the wetland for agricultural purposes. The term 'qualified conservation easement' refers to an easement granted in perpetuity by the taxpayer to restrict the use of wetlands for conservation purposes. Special rules include denying double benefits and requiring married couples to file joint returns for the tax credit. The taxpayer must be a married individual filing a joint return with their spouse for this section to apply. Amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998."
