    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act for the period of January 1 through October 31 of the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires determining the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production during a specific period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates determining the estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on actual production during a specific period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires determining the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production from initial production to October 31 of the current year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates determining the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on the average monthly production from initial production to October 31 of the current year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires estimating the annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on average monthly production up to October 31 of the current year. Total production estimates for the following year must equal the sum of estimated volumes from all facilities. Amendments in the Clean Air Act specify using exact data for volume calculations and mandate a specific volume requirement. The Clean Air Act is amended to define cellulosic biofuel and exclude certain types of fuels from this category. Additionally, regulations are established for cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways. Regulations for cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways under the Clean Air Act are amended to conform to new amendments. The mandate for cellulosic biofuel volumes for 2014 is removed."
