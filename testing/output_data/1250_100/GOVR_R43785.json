    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, but several states have legalized medical and recreational use. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, followed by Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia. The shift in popular sentiment towards marijuana legalization has led to heightened debate at the federal level. Bills in the 113th Congress propose removing marijuana from Schedule I drugs and imposing a federal excise tax. The debate spans issues from criminal justice to public health, with the potential revenue from a marijuana tax being a key factor. The report focuses on the economic debate over federal marijuana legalization, specifically on imposing an excise tax. It provides an overview of marijuana production, arguments for taxes, and analyzes possible tax designs. Marijuana, derived from the plant Cannabis sativa, is primarily used for its psychoactive effects due to the cannabinoid compound THC. Consumers may desire different strains of marijuana based on cannabinoid content, such as high CBD strains for anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can vary depending on preparation. Female marijuana plants grown without pollination can produce high-resin buds with increased THC content. Sinsemilla varieties typically contain 10%-18% THC. Marijuana is commonly consumed by smoking the dried plant. Marijuana consumption methods vary, including smoking the dried plant matter in joints or blunts. Other methods include using glass pipes or vaporizers. Cannabis can also be processed into products like hash or edibles. Excise taxes on marijuana are generally considered less desirable than other taxes. Excise taxes on marijuana are less desirable than general taxes like income or sales taxes because they distort commodity prices. Reasons for imposing an excise tax on marijuana include reflecting external costs to society, discouraging use, preventing price falls, funding programs, and raising revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price of a commodity equals its costs, and if marijuana consumption imposes costs on others, a tax equal to those costs can promote efficiency. This rationale has been used for alcohol and tobacco as well. The external costs of marijuana use, estimated at $30 billion, are much smaller than total costs. Comparing cannabis to alcohol, a British study ranked alcohol's harm at 72 and cannabis at 20. A tax may be necessary to correct for marijuana externalities, similar to alcohol and tobacco. The external costs of marijuana use are much smaller than total costs. A British study ranked alcohol's harm at 72 and cannabis at 20. Evidence suggests that marijuana has lower external harm and health costs per user compared to alcohol. Marijuana usage is also less prevalent than alcohol usage. The external costs of marijuana are estimated to range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion, based on usage rates in the past year and month. A 2014 report by the White House ONDCP provides estimates on total U.S. expenditures on marijuana in 2010, ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion. Additionally, THC levels in marijuana increased from 2000 to 2010. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report indicates that THC levels in marijuana increased from 2000 to 2010. Estimates suggest a tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price based on external costs. The price per gram of marijuana was roughly constant from 2000 to 2010, with anecdotal prices suggesting variations. Different techniques and data sources, such as priceofweed.com, estimate the price of marijuana at around $317 per ounce. The price of marijuana can vary, with estimates ranging from $224 to $317 per ounce. Tax rates can range from 0.8% to 5.3% of the price. In a legal market, prices would be lower, potentially as low as $5 per ounce. The tax on a joint would be similar to a six-pack of beer, with estimates suggesting a relatively small tax compared to current prices. Imposing a tax on marijuana could discourage users who underestimate long-term health costs and potential dependence, especially among underage users. Some studies suggest that marijuana can lead to dependence, with about 9% of users becoming dependent. Medical marijuana laws in the US may increase the likelihood of abuse or dependency by 15%-27% among adults. More research is needed to better understand the risks of marijuana. Economists debate whether users make rational choices or engage in time-inconsistent behavior. The impact of a tax on marijuana should consider potential reduction in income for users. A tax on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco taxes, would primarily affect heavy users who consume a large portion of the product. The regressive nature of the tax may be undesirable, but current users could benefit from lower prices if marijuana is legalized. The impact of the tax on consumption depends on users' response to price changes, with economists using elasticities to measure the effect on quantity consumed. Gallet (2014) analyzed 42 studies on illicit drug demand, including 13 on marijuana elasticity. The model predicts a -0.15 to -0.31 elasticity range, meaning a 1% price increase leads to a 0.15% to 0.31% decrease in demand. Users are minimally affected by price changes, making it likely that a tax for their benefit could harm them overall. Government policies aim to restrict drug use by minors, with current marijuana laws prohibiting sales to those under 21. The policy question revolves around determining the appropriate tax burden on non-responsive adult users to limit marijuana consumption among youth, who are more price-sensitive. Setting a tax to prevent a substantial price drop post-legalization and increased demand, especially among minors, is crucial. This tax aims to prevent youth consumption without hindering adult users. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. Workers in the illicit trade are currently paid more due to law enforcement risks. A competitive market could lead to lower prices reflecting lower production costs. The difference between projected cost in a legal competitive market and current prices provides a range for federal tax rates. The tax should not be set too high to avoid encouraging illicit production. Caulkins estimates production costs of legalized marijuana, with outdoor production costing less but potentially containing lower THC levels. Processing costs add $20 to $35 per pound. Producing high-quality marijuana in greenhouses costs around $15 per ounce, while outdoor production costs about $2.80 per ounce. THC concentration varies, with sinsemilla containing 10%-18% THC. Government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced at $9 per ounce. In quasi-legal jurisdictions, prices are lower than street prices but higher than production costs, with medical marijuana in Canada priced at $1.80-$5 per gram. In Canada, the price of marijuana ranges from $1.80-$5 per gram for consumers, with street prices at $10-$15 per gram. The government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram. Small growers and homegrown marijuana are no longer allowed under the new law. Actual prices can be seen on websites like Leafly.com, which helps users find marijuana shops and dispensaries. Leafly, similar to Yelp, provides consumer reviews and prices for marijuana products at various shops. In Denver, prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high-quality marijuana at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. These prices reflect a mix of illicit and legal markets, with indications of falling prices post-legalization. Prices in Colorado may not fully reflect a legal market due to quasi-legal status. Marijuana businesses face challenges with banking assistance and high federal taxes. Studies suggest a potential 50-80% price reduction post-legalization, with prices estimated at $40-$60 per ounce. Based on comparisons with the Netherlands, a 50% price reduction is estimated for legalized marijuana, with prices ranging from $100-$150 per ounce on average. However, challenges exist in fully legalizing the market due to import bans and anti-drug laws. Street prices currently range from $200-$300 per ounce, suggesting room for taxes up to $200 per ounce to align with legal prices. State and local taxes may absorb some of this difference, and setting taxes too high could encourage the illicit market, undermining the goal of eliminating it through legalization. The potential scope of reducing tax and observing market conditions for legalized marijuana is uncertain. Tax revenue could fund marijuana research, especially on medical marijuana approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Barriers to research include federal approval, lack of high-grade marijuana, and its Schedule I classification. Legalization would allow for studying various issues like externalities, addictive properties, and health effects on users. An excise tax on marijuana could generate revenue for information programs and discourage consumption by minors. The tax could be designed to achieve a specific revenue target, but the actual amount raised is uncertain due to market variables. Legalization may attract casual consumers, increasing revenue beyond current estimates. The existing price elasticity estimates suggest that the legal market for marijuana could be much larger than the current market. The pace of legalization at the state level could impact potential revenue from a federal excise tax. Analysts estimate that nationwide legalization could raise $5.8 billion annually through a federal excise tax. Institute estimates a federal excise tax on marijuana could raise $5.8 billion annually. This calculation considers market size, price fall after legalization, consumption increase, and law enforcement savings. The tax is estimated at $50-$75 per ounce. Revenue yield depends on market conditions, state, and federal taxes. Data on price and quantity are crucial for accurate estimation. The potential revenue from a federal excise tax on marijuana is estimated at $8 billion annually, assuming a $40 billion market and a $250 current price. This calculation takes into account the effects of legalization on price, consumption, and tax rates. The tax collection would be based on the quantity of marijuana sold at a total price of $150 per ounce. Assuming a price elasticity of -0.25, legalization would lead to a 50% increase in quantity with a price of $50 per ounce. With taxes, the price becomes $150, resulting in a 14% increase in quantity and projected excise tax collection of $9.1 billion. After accounting for income and wage tax losses, the estimated revenue gain is $6.8 billion. The yield depends on the extent of legalization movement and coverage of medical marijuana. Currently, only Colorado and Washington allow recreational marijuana, representing less than 4% of the population, so short-term yield might be less than $300 million. The potential yield from taxing medical marijuana in other states could exceed $300 million. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington can provide insights into the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Marijuana sales are subject to multiple layers of taxation at the state and local levels, with effective tax rates ranging from 15% to 25%. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in taxes and fees on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014. The national market for marijuana could be estimated based on tax revenue data from Colorado, with sales tax base for recreational marijuana estimated between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. Medical marijuana consumption could roughly double that base. Combined sales in Colorado suggest a market of at least $30 billion, smaller than illicit markets. The Colorado market for marijuana may be underdeveloped, leading to continued illicit sales. Consumption could be inflated due to non-resident sales. Design issues for an excise tax include levying it at earlier production stages to reduce administrative costs and tax evasion risks. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed on manufacturers and imports. Taxing marijuana can be based on weight or potency. A weight-based tax is similar to tobacco excise tax and is easy to administer. It can be levied on wet or dried weight but may encourage more potent marijuana. Potency-based tax proposals are based on THC content per ounce and are more complex to enforce due to accurate lab testing requirements. Lab testing for marijuana potency can be costly, with prices ranging from $60-$120 per sample. Legalization may lead to more labs entering the market, potentially reducing testing costs. However, measuring THC content accurately can be challenging due to the nature of some marijuana products. A tax based on THC potency could encourage consumption of less-potent marijuana, which may have negative public health implications. Alternative potency calculations, such as THC to cannabidiol ratio, could be considered. An alternative potency calculation for marijuana taxation based on THC to cannabidiol ratio could encourage consumers to choose products with more sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, like those in Colorado and Washington, can automatically adjust for price changes and are easily applied to a variety of products. However, regulations are needed to specify taxable prices. A manufacturers tax imposed after the plant is grown is simpler to administer, as seen with federal excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol. Regulations for vertically integrated firms need to address how to determine manufacturers' prices without market transactions. A retail tax system, similar to a sales tax, could capture price markups due to product type or market power. The price of marijuana products could be based on various characteristics beyond intoxication potential. Indexing tax rates for inflation, like using the Consumer Price Index, could be considered. Sunset provisions in marijuana tax legislation could help manage uncertainty in prices and demand post-legalization. Sunset provisions in marijuana tax laws could prompt revisions to better align with industry changes. Tax rates could start low to combat the black market, then gradually increase to curb consumption. Delegating rate adjustments to officials or using a combination of taxation methods, like a general tax with surcharges for high-THC products, could shape consumption patterns. Differential tax rates, similar to alcohol and cigarettes, may help mitigate social costs but could lead to unequal tax burdens among consumers. The taxation of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana is discussed, with considerations for integrating existing stocks of marijuana into the tax base. Lawmakers may need to address taxation of marijuana plants and products in jurisdictions where sales are legalized. Integrating preexisting marijuana products could help meet demand, simplify tax regulations, and increase federal tax revenue, but compliance with new regulations may be a challenge. An alternative option could involve a lead time between enacting the tax and the start of legalized sales to allow producers to comply with regulations. The first legalized sales date allows producers time to comply with federal regulations, aiding legal producers and retailers to compete with the underground market. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to integrating existing plants into legal stocks. Federal excise taxes may apply to untaxed floor stocks to prevent inventory buildup. Policy makers may implement federal regulations or allow states to create their own laws on taxation of marijuana. State laws in Colorado and Washington set age restrictions for recreational marijuana purchases, limiting sales to individuals aged 21 or older. Excluding younger consumers from the legal tax base could potentially lead to underground production or indirect sales through of-age connections. Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana with no transaction limit, while non-residents are restricted to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction. The restriction on non-residents in Colorado and Washington limits them to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction to reduce risks of diversion or export. More restrictive purchasing limits and ad valorem tax rates can increase the effective tax rate on heavy users. Production limits based on market size or per grower are being considered. Washington aims for a maximum market size of 80 metric tons, while Colorado has no target. Concerns about diversion to other states or countries where marijuana is illegal are being addressed through taxation closer to the production chain. Kleiman, a professor at UCLA and former marijuana policy consultant, believes production limits could curb negative social consequences of marijuana consumption by larger producers. However, production limits are inefficient and unlikely to work in a legal market. Tax treatment of medical marijuana varies by jurisdiction, with Colorado applying a 2.9% general sales tax. The issue of medical need for marijuana is contentious. Evidence suggests a negative correlation between medical marijuana and prescription drugs, as deaths from prescription drug overdoses have declined in states with medical marijuana. Differences in after-tax prices of recreational and medical marijuana could incentivize users to seek medical prescriptions. Exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could limit the tax base if strict standards for medical prescriptions are not enforced. Segregation of sales and marking devices may be necessary if medical marijuana is exempt from tax. Washington allows home growing of up to six plants for recreational use, with households permitted to grow up to 12 plants. Federal law prohibits home distilling of alcohol, but allows limited production of wine and beer. Tobacco can be grown without limit. The debate on home marijuana production includes considerations of quantity limits and taxation exemptions. Experts suggest that a high quantity limit may be necessary, as a single plant can yield a pound of marijuana. While some argue that home production may not significantly impact tax revenue, others believe it could undermine enforcement efforts. Banning home production of marijuana could increase tax revenue and enforcement efforts. Small producers may be eligible for lower tax rates, but it may be more efficient to collect taxes from larger producers. One option is to apply a lower tax to outdoor marijuana cultivation, which uses less energy. However, concerns exist about the negative environmental effects of outdoor cultivation. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana production could lead to indoor cultivation. Federal tax options include a special occupational tax on marijuana businesses. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes a yearly tax on marijuana producers. Enforcement and administrative efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana. The illicit trade of bootleg spirits in the US continued after Prohibition until tariff cuts on spirit imports were negotiated. Today, enforcing marijuana laws would require deterring consumers from illicit transactions and compelling producers to obtain licenses and pay taxes. Legalizing and taxing marijuana without adequate resources for enforcement could undermine the federal tax base. Marijuana smuggling may be more prevalent than illegal alcohol production due to its compact nature, but its pungency poses challenges. Tax collection on marijuana could be more efficient if done closer to the point of production, using methods like tax stamps, seals on packages, individual marks on joints, or dye. New technologies like genetic markers or tracking systems could also be utilized. Colorado tracks marijuana plants from \"seed to sale\" using RFID tags. Marijuana enterprises in Colorado report inventory to the Marijuana Enforcement Division through a computer system called MITS. Standardized regulations for weights and potency measurements would be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety and accurate dosing. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different strains of marijuana. Different tax rates for medical and recreational marijuana could create arbitrage opportunities for consumers, especially heavy users. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate, allowing certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp. Hemp, with low THC concentrations, has no commercial value as a psychoactive. Legalizing hemp for industrial production, separate from marijuana, could be considered for tax purposes based on THC quantity. Oglesby distinguishes hemp from marijuana for tax purposes based on THC content. In the US, hemp is defined as having less than \u00bd of 1% THC, while Europe and Canada require less than 0.3% THC. There are concerns about marijuana being hidden in hemp fields, but experts argue that cross-pollination would weaken marijuana plants. The federal legalization of marijuana could impact state tax policies, with some states currently relying on private businesses for marijuana sales. State-based monopolies for regulating marijuana sales are debated, with proponents citing regulation benefits and opponents concerned about corruption and revenue motives. The uncertainty surrounding legalized marijuana, including market size and consumer response to pricing, makes revenue projections uncertain. The uncertainty surrounding legalized marijuana, including market size and consumer response to pricing, makes revenue projections uncertain. The tax base for legalized marijuana sales is more limited compared to alcohol or tobacco, especially if medical marijuana sales are exempt from federal taxation. Additionally, the relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption is a key factor in determining the social costs of marijuana legalization. The costs of alcohol consumption are well documented in academic studies. Marijuana may have positive spillover effects on society if it is a substitute for alcohol, as it has fewer social costs. However, if marijuana is consumed with alcohol, it may result in negative spillover effects. Researchers have not reached a consensus on this issue due to limitations in economic studies and regulations on marijuana research in the United States. The effects of commercial and recreational legalization, like in Colorado or Washington, have not been fully captured in studies. The uncertainty surrounding the relationship between alcohol and marijuana use is important for potential marijuana tax implications. Initiatives in Colorado and Washington provide insight into broader legalization effects. The social costs of marijuana legalization may vary based on polydrug use, with some viewing marijuana as a gateway drug. Studies show lower addiction risks compared to cocaine, crack, or heroin. Current research on the effects of marijuana use on traffic fatalities is limited by methodological and technological shortcomings. Marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in crashes, but there is no clear causal link between marijuana use and traffic fatalities. Testing technology for marijuana intoxication is currently limited. The ability to detect marijuana intoxication in drivers is limited by current testing technology. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to savings in criminal justice spending, with estimates varying widely. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 31.2% of federal offenders in FY2013 were sentenced for drug-related offenses, with 28.4% of these sentences related to marijuana. Legalizing marijuana may lead to a 2% reduction in state and local jail populations over time, but federal legalization would not impact current inmates serving sentences for marijuana-related charges. Legalizing marijuana would not affect state and local inmates serving sentences for marijuana-related charges. The majority of costs associated with the black market for illicit drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. Marijuana producers and retailers cannot deduct expenses for federal tax filings. The IRS enforces Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, disallowing deductions for marijuana businesses, leading to significant tax penalties. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, are challenging these penalties in court. The IRS refused to accept $2.6 million in business deductions for employee salaries, rent, and other costs over three years for Canna Care marijuana dispensary in San Francisco, CA. Discrepancies between federal and state tax treatments create economic incentives for underground economy. Marijuana businesses cannot deduct business expenses, leading to implicit taxes up to 39.6% or 35%. Illicit marijuana sellers have an economic advantage due to the current federal tax laws. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 (H.R. 2240) aims to exempt compliant marijuana businesses from certain tax prohibitions. The IRS prohibits business deductions for marijuana sales under IRC Section 280E. Estimates of national marijuana sales volume can be calculated using data from Colorado or Washington, but may underestimate total demand. Colorado's tax revenue data is used to estimate the state's marijuana tax base. The recreational tax base can be derived from retail marijuana sales tax or general sales tax data. Underground marijuana market impact on state-licensed stores is uncertain. The tax base for recreational marijuana sales in Colorado is calculated by averaging the results of two different tax rates. In September 2014, the state reported $2.9 million from a 10% retail marijuana sales tax and $886,915 from a 2.9% sales tax on non-medical marijuana. By averaging these figures, an estimate of $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales for that month was determined. This data can be used to extrapolate national sales tax bases by adjusting for population and marijuana usage rates. The tax base for recreational and medical marijuana sales in Colorado is calculated based on population and usage rates, without considering major price changes or tax variations. Using data from August 2014, national sales tax base for recreational marijuana is estimated at $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year. Medical marijuana sales in Colorado were $31.3 million in September 2014, with monthly sales ranging between $31 million and $35 million from January to September 2014. State sales tax collections data from FY2013 show the impact before the legalization of recreational marijuana. Based on Colorado's tax collections data, annual medical marijuana sales are estimated at $314.2 million. It is uncertain if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has affected the demand for medical marijuana in Colorado. Medical marijuana consumption could potentially double total marijuana consumption amounts. There may be a self-selection bias in medical marijuana patient data, and users denied for a medical card could turn to recreational marijuana post-legalization."
