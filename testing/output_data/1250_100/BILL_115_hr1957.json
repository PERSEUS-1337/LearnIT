    "content": "The \"Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2017\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that bullying and harassment in schools can seriously harm students' physical and psychological health, leading to high dropout rates and academic underachievement. These behaviors include physical violence, name-calling, intimidation, and cyberbullying. Schools with anti-bullying policies have higher reporting levels. Policies have increased reporting and teacher intervention in bullying and harassment incidents, reducing their frequency. Students are targeted based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. Some experience relational aggression, damaging relationships with peers. Interventions like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports can create a positive school climate and minimize exclusionary discipline policies. According to a poll, 85 percent of Americans support a Federal law to prevent bullying in schools. Students, parents, educators, and policymakers are calling for action to address the national crisis of bullying and harassment. SEC. 3. SAFE SCHOOLS IMPROVEMENT. Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to address bullying and harassment in public schools through anti-bullying policies. The amended Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 addresses bullying and harassment in public schools by requiring states receiving grants to implement policies that prevent and prohibit severe, persistent, or pervasive bullying and harassment conduct that creates a hostile educational environment. The policies must include a prohibition on bullying or harassment based on a student's actual or perceived race, color, or other characteristics. The local educational agency must provide annual notice of prohibited conduct, including bullying or harassment based on various characteristics such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, homelessness, or military affiliation. Grievance procedures must be in place for students or parents to report complaints regarding such conduct. The local educational agency must collect annual data on incidents of prohibited conduct, report it publicly at the school and agency level, and ensure victims remain anonymous. Positive and preventative discipline approaches should be encouraged to minimize student removal from instruction and prevent disproportionate treatment. Students who engage in prohibited conduct, as described in paragraph (2), will not face disproportionate punishment. State reports must be submitted by the chief executive officer of a State receiving a grant under this title, in cooperation with the State educational agency. The report should include information reported by local educational agencies and describe the State's plans to support local educational agency efforts in addressing prohibited conduct. The Secretary is required to conduct a biennial evaluation of programs and policies to combat bullying and harassment in schools, including data collection on prohibited conduct. A report on the findings must be submitted to the President and Congress every two years. This evaluation is independent of state reports submitted by the chief executive officer of each state receiving a grant under this title. The curr_chunk states that federal and state nondiscrimination laws, as well as free speech and expression laws, are not affected by the regulations outlined in the text. It emphasizes that the obligations imposed by this part are additional to existing laws protecting against discrimination and upholding freedom of speech. The text chunk outlines that states and local entities can enact laws to prevent bullying or harassment of students as long as they are not inconsistent with the regulations in this part. It also introduces a new section in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 related to Safe Schools Improvement."
