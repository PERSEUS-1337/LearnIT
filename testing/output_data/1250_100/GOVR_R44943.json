    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patents involving human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. Courts and the USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. In recent years, Section 101 has been used more frequently to invalidate patents. The Supreme Court decisions since 2010 have led to increased use of Section 101 to invalidate patents at the USPTO. Some view this as a crisis in the patent system, with concerns over confusing legal standards and chaos created by the Court's rulings. This report reviews the current law governing patentable subject matter and recent proposals for legislative reform, discussing Supreme Court decisions and their implications in the information technology and life sciences industries. Individuals and enterprises must submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection, with examiners assessing the merit of the application under the Patent Act of 1952. The Patent Act requires applicants to draft claims that distinctly point out their invention. The patent acquisition process, known as \"prosecution,\" involves examiners assessing if the invention meets standards of novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior knowledge, while nonobviousness means it must not be readily achievable by a skilled artisan. Utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides a tangible benefit. Section 101 of the Patent Act outlines the categories of patentable subject matter, including processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Process patents involve a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. The term \"machine\" encompasses mechanical devices, while \"manufacture\" refers to the production of articles from raw materials. The term \"manufacture\" is defined as the production of articles from raw materials. The term \"composition of matter\" includes all compositions of two or more substances. Courts and the USPTO have set limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court views these as essential tools of scientific and technological work that should be freely available to all. The USPTO grants patents to applications that meet requirements, giving inventors exclusive rights for 20 years. This allows them to profit from their inventions and enforce their intellectual property through litigation if necessary. The Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary authority to review cases. Recent Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the range of patentable subject matter, revisiting the issue in a series of four decisions from 2010 to 2014. The Supreme Court issued a series of decisions from 2010 to 2014 narrowing patent eligibility, impacting the patent system significantly. In the 2010 Bilski v. Kappos case, the Court deemed a method of hedging risk in commodities trading unpatentable under Section 101. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for a method of hedging risk in commodities trading, stating that it did not meet the requirements for patent eligibility under Section 101. The court determined that the claimed process was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus and did not result in a physical transformation. The USPTO denied Bilski's patent application for a method of hedging risk in commodities trading, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that Bilski's invention could not be patented based on the traditional rule that abstract ideas are not patentable subject matter. Justice Kennedy stated that hedging was a fundamental economic practice and not eligible for a patent. The Supreme Court denied Bilski's patent application for a risk hedging method, stating that it would grant a monopoly over an abstract idea. Justice Stevens agreed with the machine-or-transformation test but believed methods of doing business should not be patentable. Justice Breyer highlighted that the test is useful but not the only standard for assessing patentability. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court focused on life sciences, specifically on patents claiming methods for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune diseases. The patents involve administering the drug, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting dosage based on the results to enhance treatment efficacy. Claim 1 of the `623 patent exemplifies the patents' claims. The Supreme Court concluded that patents claiming methods for optimizing therapeutic efficacy in treating immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Court emphasized that monopolizing basic tools through patents could hinder innovation. The Supreme Court recognized that patents claiming methods for optimizing therapeutic efficacy in treating immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Court emphasized that monopolizing basic tools through patents could hinder innovation. The Court further analyzed the claims, noting that while they included steps beyond the natural laws, these additional steps were not enough to qualify as patent-eligible processes. The Supreme Court's decision in Mayo v. Prometheus concluded that steps in a patent claim did not transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications of those regularities. Justice Breyer explained that limiting the use of a natural law to a particular technological environment cannot render the principle patentable. The Court emphasized that advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. The Supreme Court's opinion in Mayo v. Prometheus rejected arguments that the patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test. Justice Breyer explained that measuring metabolite levels did not require transforming human blood, and the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability. The Court also addressed the notion that any step beyond stating a law of nature should fulfill Section 101 standards. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Preexisting substances found in the wild may not be patented, but significant artificial changes can make them patentable. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad Genetics, Inc. v. Association for Molecular Pathology ruled that isolated genomic DNA is not eligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. This decision challenged over 50,000 patents related to DNA, including those for isolated human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancer predisposition. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad's gene patent claims for BRCA1 and BRCA2, stating that isolated DNA was not significantly different from native DNA. However, the Federal Circuit reversed this decision, arguing that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case but did not issue a ruling. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it back to the Federal Circuit. Justice Thomas stated that Myriad did not create anything by discovering the genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The Court was unimpressed by Myriad's claims of isolated DNA not being an act of invention. The Court found that cDNA, or complementary DNA, could be patented as it is synthetic DNA with a sequence complementary to naturally-occurring DNA. The Myriad case did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or altered DNA sequences, but rather focused on the patent eligibility of isolated genes. In a recent Supreme Court decision, Justice Thomas and seven colleagues agreed that isolated genomic DNA could not be patented. Justice Scalia concurred but disagreed on the details of molecular biology. The Court also considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The patents in question involved methods for exchanging financial obligations and computer systems to carry out those methods. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents related to computer-implemented inventions were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained that the Court's precedent established a two-part test to identify patents claiming laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The Supreme Court established a two-part test to determine if patents claim excluded subject matter. Justice Thomas emphasized the need for an \"inventive concept\" to transform a claim into a patent-eligible application. The Court found that the method claims in question were directed to an abstract idea and lacked the necessary inventive concept for patent eligibility. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. Justice Thomas emphasized that simply implementing an abstract idea on a computer does not make it patentable. The Court rejected claims that only recited generic computer hardware without adding meaningful technological limitations. The two-part test examines whether a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. The Court uses a two-part test to determine patent eligibility, analyzing if a claim covers every practical application of a fundamental concept. The inclusion of routine hardware like a general-purpose computer does not affect Section 101 eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost, but not the sole determinant. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation without a formal claim construction. Statistical analyses show that Section 101 challenges have a high success rate in invalidating patent claims. Courts have examined 568 challenged patents under \u00a7101 motions, resulting in a 66.5% invalidation rate. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 patent applications under Alice, indicating a good chance of success when asserting a patent claim is invalid. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted patent validity in various technologies such as chemicals, consumer devices, electronics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, tools, and vehicles. The focus has been on information technologies, with courts invalidating patents on computer-related inventions that do not offer specific solutions or improvements in technology. This has led to a high success rate in Section 101 challenges, with over 36,000 patent applications rejected by the USPTO under Alice. The curr_chunk discusses a system and method for collecting, analyzing, and displaying information related to an electric power grid using computer technology. It also mentions methods for extracting data from hard copy documents, administering life insurance policies, and processing credit applications over electronic networks. Additionally, it mentions a patent invalidated in a court decision regarding out-of-region access to local broadcasts via a cellular telephone. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent related to out-of-region access to local broadcasts via a cellular telephone, deeming it an abstract idea without specific implementation details. This decision was based on the idea being confined to a specific technological environment without describing how the invention achieved its functions. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, affecting patentability of diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed Section 101 in the life sciences compared to information technologies. The 2015 ruling of the Federal Circuit in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. involved a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method for detecting fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. The Federal Circuit found that the method failed the two-part patentable subject matter test. The Federal Circuit ruled that the invention in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. failed the patentable subject matter test due to claims involving a naturally occurring phenomenon and conventional techniques. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the innovation's importance in prenatal diagnosis. Congress has the option to address patentable subject matter laws through legislation, but no action has been taken since the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011. Two industry associations, AIPLA and IPO, have proposed modifications to Section 101 of the America Invents Act. Their proposals aim to redefine patentable subject matter to include useful processes, machines, compositions of matter, and improvements, while excluding inventions existing in nature or solely in the human mind. The AIPLA and IPO proposed modifications to Section 101 of the America Invents Act, aiming to redefine patentable subject matter. The ABA also offered a related proposal to amend Section 101 regarding conditions for patentability. The AIPLA and ABA proposed changes to Section 101 of the America Invents Act to clarify patent eligibility criteria, emphasizing the importance of practical applications and enabling provisions over novelty and obviousness considerations. The IPO criticizes the Supreme Court's analysis of patent eligibility, calling it restrictive and contrary to congressional intent. Some believe legislative reform is unnecessary, as restrictive rules have not impacted innovation. Proposed amendments could remove limits on software patenting and eliminate constraints on subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal would change the current statutory phrase to potentially allow for broader patent eligibility. The debate over patent eligibility standards, particularly in software and life sciences, has sparked controversy. Recent Supreme Court interest has made patenting in these fields more challenging, leading to concerns about innovation and investment. While some argue that Section 101 maintains a balance between inventor contributions and patent rights, others fear a lack of patent availability may stifle innovation. These discussions may prompt further examination of what types of inventions should be patentable."
