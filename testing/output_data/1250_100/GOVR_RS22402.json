    "content": "The Department of Defense's budget for health care has more than doubled since FY2001, reaching over $44.8 billion in FY2009 and projected to grow to $64 billion by FY2015. Health-care expenses could constitute over 12% of the DOD budget by 2015, impacting spending on other defense programs. The Defense health system serves 9.3 million potential beneficiaries with varying care options for different groups. Medicare does not cover Tricare Reserve Select for reservists and their families. Military retirees aged 65 and above are eligible for treatment in military medical facilities. Tricare beneficiaries include retirees under 65, TFL retirees, and active duty personnel. Care is provided through Tricare Prime, Tricare Extra, Tricare Standard, and TFL plans. Prescriptions are available at military pharmacies at no cost. Prescriptions are available from military pharmacies at no cost or civilian pharmacies linked to DOD with low co-payments. Factors contributing to cost growth include increases in medical service and prescription costs, the establishment of TFL, and expanded access to defense health care for non-active duty reservists. The Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 (P.L. 109-364) made changes to Tricare Prime, eliminating co-payments and lowering the catastrophic cap for retirees. Concerns about the costs of defense health care stem from the generous benefits provided by DOD with limited contributions required from beneficiaries. Most DOD medical care is directed towards dependents and retirees, rather than combat injuries. Tricare beneficiaries, both active duty and retired, utilize professional care more than other sectors. In FY2004, Tricare beneficiaries, both active duty and retired, utilized professional care more than other sectors, with higher outpatient and inpatient utilization rates compared to civilian HMOs. This is attributed to lower out-of-pocket costs for DOD beneficiaries. Changes were proposed in the FY2007 budget to constrain health care costs by introducing annual enrollment fees for Tricare Standard and increasing fees for Tricare Prime, with no impact on active duty military and their dependents. The Bush Administration proposed changes to Tricare benefits in FY2008 and FY2009 to address budgetary concerns, including adjusting cost shares annually for inflation and increasing Tricare premiums and co-payments for TFL-eligible beneficiaries. The FY2008 budget submission assumed $1.8 billion in savings from benefit reforms, while the FY2009 submission endorsed recommendations from the Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care for $1.2 billion in savings. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation recommended changes to Tricare premiums and co-payments for retirees under age 65, linking deductibles to Medicare rates and limiting prescription drug payments. The report also suggested financing health care for retirees through accrual accounting. In response, the Department of Defense issued a report in January 2009 endorsing some of these recommendations. The Department of Defense endorsed some recommendations from the 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation regarding Tricare premiums and co-payments for retirees under age 65. The DOD expressed concerns about increasing Tricare costs and the impact on the overall budget, stating that healthcare expenses are a significant burden. The FY2010 Base budget request includes $47.4 billion for military healthcare funding. The FY2010 Base budget request includes $47.4 billion for military healthcare funding. Projections show healthcare costs will rise by 5 to 7 percent annually through FY2015 due to increased utilization, inflation, and expanded benefits. DOD officials plan to link weapons cuts to rising healthcare costs and propose fee increases to address budget concerns. Congress may decide to increase Tricare fees, which have not changed since the mid-1990s. Provisions in defense authorization acts have prohibited DOD from increasing premiums, deductibles, and other charges until September 30, 2009. Additionally, civilian employers were prohibited from offering incentives to retired servicemembers to rely on Tricare. A DOD Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care was established to examine efforts to improve and sustain defense health care. The Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care recommended phased-in changes in enrollment fees and deductibles to restore cost-sharing relationships. GAO released a report stating that DOD had overestimated savings from higher Tricare fees. The GAO report in May 2007 found that DOD had overestimated savings from higher Tricare fees. Despite Congress rejecting fee increases for FY2009, preventive health measures were enacted to reduce future usage, including waiving copayments for preventive services and implementing a military health risk management project. The curr_chunk discusses various healthcare programs and projects authorized by different sections, including a smoking cessation program, a preventive health allowance demonstration project, and additional authority for studies and demonstration projects. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of these programs to be around $50 million per year over three years. Congress may revisit proposals for fee increases as part of more comprehensive changes in defense health care. One option for defense health-care budgeting changes is to offer retirees a lump-sum payment to forego health care until age 65. Another approach is a \"cafeteria plan\" providing an annual cash allowance for health care, allowing retirees to choose between Tricare, a new plan with lower fees but higher costs, or using funds for civilian health insurance premiums. These approaches could reduce DOD's outlays by 25%, excluding the cash allowance cost. The Obama Administration has chosen not to propose any Tricare user fee increases for FY2010, but the budget submission does propose reducing spending on weapons acquisitions. Legislators may consider using cost savings from the Tricare program to restore funding for these cuts. Some have suggested readjusting budget categories to remove health-care spending for retirees, which could encourage more meaningful analyses of defense issues. The DOD proposed adjusting fees to make up for frozen fee structures, which are still lower than civilian plans. Retiree organizations argue that fee hikes are unfair, especially for retiring servicemembers who have sacrificed in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are complex considerations in dealing with military medical spending, with some recognizing a special responsibility for healthcare after retirement as an incentive for a dangerous career. Competing defense fund requirements exist, and some argue that medical care funds should not be compromised. The DOD proposed fee increases in 2006 to address frozen fee structures, which are lower than civilian plans. Retiree organizations argue that fee hikes are unfair, especially for retiring servicemembers who have sacrificed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Competing defense fund requirements exist, and some argue that medical care funds should not be seen as unlimited."
