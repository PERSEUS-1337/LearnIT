Congress and presidential administrations have backed national policies to help minority businesses achieve parity in the free enterprise system. The MBDA formulates and coordinates federal policies and programs to assist minority business enterprises. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) provides support to minority business enterprises through technical expertise and resources. Despite lacking statutory authorization, Congress has funded MBDA for 48 years. The Trump Administration proposed reducing funding, but both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended an appropriation of $34 million for FY2018. The MBDA, originally established as the Office of Minority Business Enterprises by President Nixon in 1969, promotes minority participation in the economy. Nixon bypassed Congress to create the OMBE, aiming to address racial inequality and social injustice. The agency's mission was to strengthen minority businesses' participation in federal programs. The Office of Minority Business Enterprises (OMBE) was established by President Nixon in 1969 to promote minority participation in the economy. Executive Order 11458 aimed to strengthen minority businesses' involvement in federal activities and establish a clearinghouse for information support. The Advisory Council on Minority Enterprise (ACME) played a significant role in shaping OMBE's agenda, but the agency faced challenges such as organizational difficulties and a lack of cooperation from other departments. President Nixon established the Office of Minority Business Enterprises (OMBE) in 1969 to promote minority participation in the economy. Executive Order 11625, signed in 1971, clarified and strengthened OMBE's role, giving the Secretary a clear mandate to establish federal policy for minority enterprise. The new EO also called for the creation of a network of minority business centers to provide support and technical assistance. The Minority Business Development Agency was established during the Carter Administration to provide managerial and technical assistance, including financial support, to minority businesses. The agency aimed to help minority businesses grow into medium and large firms in growth industries to create jobs and improve the economy. The MBDA was established to support minority businesses and improve the economy. Successive Administrations refined the agency's focus and established the MBDC program to provide services to minority entrepreneurs. President Reagan issued E.O. 12432 to encourage minority business participation in federal procurement. President George H.W. Bush proposed transferring the agency's mission to the SBA. In 1994, President Clinton issued E.O. 12928 to promote procurement with small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals, black colleges, and minority institutions. The Clinton Administration supported budget increases for the MBDA to establish Rural Business Development Centers and enhance services through programs like CBES. The CBES pilot program under the MBDA had significant deficiencies in administration, lacking proper monitoring and assessment of grantees' performance. Recommendations included developing project-specific performance measures, assigning staff with technical expertise, and conducting thorough evaluations. The George W. Bush Administration continued efforts to coordinate MBDA programs with the SBA, focusing resources on minority firms with $500,000 or more in annual revenues. The State of Minority Business Enterprise found that minority firms with annual gross receipts of $500,000 or more generated a larger percentage of revenues and employed more people compared to smaller minority firms. The agency funded programs like National Enterprise Centers, MBDCs, and MBOCs to support businesses with growth potential and access to capital. They also focused on special projects, youth entrepreneurship, access to capital, and developing a database of procurement opportunities. Starting in the 1990s, the agency began assisting minority firms to enter new markets. In the 1990s, the agency started helping minority firms enter the global market. A 2003 study by MBDA highlighted that minority businesses can compete by leveraging their strengths in developing countries. However, there is a lack of updated information on MBEs' international interactions, hindering policy design. The Obama Administration focused on quantifying MBDA's impact and improving service delivery for minority firms expanding globally. The MBDA focuses on quantifying its impact, delivering services efficiently to minority business communities, and coordinating with other federal agencies like the SBA, ITA, and EDA. It primarily serves minority businesses with revenues of at least $1 million annually, focusing on high-growth areas such as technology and bio-medicine. MBDA business centers offer a range of services to minority-owned firms looking to expand domestically and internationally. The MBDA provides technical assistance and business services to minority business enterprises through business consulting, private equity opportunities, and joint ventures. Operators of MBDA business centers are eligible to receive a minimum annual award of $250,000 for a contract period of three years. Currently, MBDA funds 31 Business Centers and 10 Specialty Centers offering various services, including exports, manufacturing, capital formation, and procurement. Despite efforts to establish a statutory mandate, Congress has not enacted one. Despite efforts to establish a statutory mandate for the MBDA, Congress has not enacted enabling legislation during the agency's 48-year history. Congress has continued to provide appropriations for the agency's mission, totaling over $1.8 billion since its inception. The agency's annual appropriations have remained relatively unchanged since 1996, fluctuating between $25 million and $31.5 million. The Trump Administration's proposed budget for FY2018 requested $6 million for MBDA, significantly less than the $34 million appropriated for FY2017. The Trump Administration supports terminating the MBDA and its programs to reduce federal spending. The agency's mission is seen as critical by supporters for minority entrepreneurs. The House Appropriations Committee approved $34 million for MBDA activities in the FY2018 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee approved $34 million for MBDA activities in the FY2018 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, with a vote of 31-21. The bill includes language directing the MBDA to allocate at least 50% of its appropriation through cooperative agreements, external awards, and grants. The report also requires the MBDA to submit a report on the state of minority businesses, including their access to capital, within 180 days of the bill's enactment. This language was incorporated into the FY2018 omnibus appropriation measure, H.R. 3354, which passed the House on September 14, 2017. The MBDA is tasked with promoting and assisting minority-owned businesses, with a focus on improving their access to capital. Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to fund MBDA at the same rate as FY2017, with a slight rescission. The agency measures its effectiveness by tracking job creation and retention, reporting 26,896 jobs created or retained in FY2015. The MBDA helped create or retain nearly 100,000 jobs from FY2012 to FY2015. In FY2015, minority businesses secured $5.9 billion in contracts and capital with MBDA's assistance, with federal contracts accounting for 14.7%. The Return on Taxpayer Investment (ROI) measures the effectiveness of MBDA's annual appropriations in leveraging investments, with $247.6 generated for every $1 in MBDA funds in FY2014. In FY2014, $247.6 in total investments was generated for every $1 in MBDA funds appropriated, but in FY2015, the ratio declined to $197.4. The MBDA has been the subject of critical reports examining its efficacy in assisting minority businesses and program management issues. The George W. Bush Administration's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) evaluated the agency in 2007, finding its performance to be Adequate with high marks for program purpose and design, strategic planning, and program management. The MBDA program has strong management and awards grants through a competitive process. While focused on minority small businesses, there are other sources of business assistance at federal, state, and local levels. Past reports by the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General found issues with performance measures and unreliable data in reporting results. The MBDA program faced issues with reporting inaccurate results in FY2004 due to combining data from different programs, leading to inflated client numbers. A 1998 audit report highlighted deficiencies in monitoring a pilot project, with the MBDA failing to follow proper procedures. The agency agreed to implement recommendations for clearer performance measures and better monitoring practices. The Nixon Administration announced the creation of the MBDA but did not propose enabling legislation. Several bills have been introduced in past Congresses to establish statutory authority for the agency. No bills were introduced during the 114th Congress to authorize the MBDA. The 96th Congress considered but did not pass legislative proposals for the agency. During the 99th Congress, bills were introduced to establish a permanent MBDA within the Department of Commerce, granting the agency authority for various activities to support minority businesses. Representative Parren Mitchell introduced a bill to deny appropriations to the MBDA to avoid duplication of services with the SBA. During the 101st through the 104th Congress, legislation was introduced to re-designate MBDA as the Minority Business Development Administration, aiming to assist disadvantaged businesses in penetrating markets, forming joint ventures, providing financial assistance, conducting pilot projects for access to capital, supporting management education, and conducting research. In the 111th Congress, Senator Bob Casey introduced the Minority Business Development Improvements Act of 2010 to establish the Minority Business Development Program for qualified minority businesses. The Minority Business Development Program aimed to provide technical assistance and contract procurement support to qualified minority businesses. It required that at least 51% of the business be owned or controlled by historically disadvantaged individuals. Additionally, the program would offer loan guarantees and support federal procurement opportunities for disadvantaged businesses. Representative Bobby L. Rush introduced the Minority Business Development Improvements Act of 2009 to establish this program. The bill proposed by Representative Rush aimed to provide assistance to qualified minority businesses by establishing a program that would offer technical support, loan guarantees, and contract procurement assistance. It defined qualified minority businesses as entities with at least 51% ownership by historically disadvantaged individuals and set a net worth limit for the principals. The bill also directed the National Director of MBDA to create a database for subcontracting opportunities, enter into agreements for set-aside contracting, and enforce program compliance. During the 113th Congress, Representative Bobby Rush introduced H.R. 2551, the Expanding Opportunities for Main Street Act, which included provisions for the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA). In 2012, the National Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise (NACMBE) released recommendations to improve MBDA's effectiveness. The 2012 recommendations for the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) included centralizing efforts, assisting minority-owned businesses in developing long-term relations with larger enterprises, expanding access to capital, establishing an MBE Academy for ongoing education, and building a comprehensive database for policy analysis. The issue of whether MBDA complements or duplicates SBA programs for the disadvantaged has been debated, with calls for termination and transfer of activities to the SBA. The MBDA focuses on enhancing medium and large scale minority firms, while SBA supports small and startup minority firms. The agency's existence is determined by each new President, with past proposals for statutory authority not passed. The President can terminate agency activities without congressional consent, but Congress can appropriate funds or modify the executive order to support the agency."
