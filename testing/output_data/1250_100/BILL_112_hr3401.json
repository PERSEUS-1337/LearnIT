    "content": "The \"Enhanced Border Security Act\" aims to protect US citizens from external threats by implementing counterinsurgency tactics to combat terrorist activities in Mexico. This includes securing the US-Mexico border, cutting off funding for criminal organizations in US cities, and assisting the Mexican government in reducing violence, corruption, and improving cooperation between military and law enforcement. Mexican drug cartels have evolved into transnational criminal organizations, engaging in various illicit activities such as human smuggling, stolen oil trafficking, weapons smuggling, extortion, kidnapping, and cybercrime. They have increased profits through these activities, with estimates of stolen oil proceeds ranging from $2 billion to $4 billion annually. Transnational criminal organizations pose a direct security threat to the United States, as highlighted in a July 2011 White House report. The Merida Initiative, led by the Department of State, has failed to address the evolution of Mexican drug cartels into transnational criminal organizations, their diversification of illicit activities, and the implementation of insurgency tactics that undermine the Mexican state. The initiative has also faced implementation challenges and programmatic delays. The Accountability Office report highlighted delays in equipment deliveries and a lack of clear benchmarks for success in the Merida Initiative. The strategy aims to isolate Mexican transnational criminal organizations from their sources of power, address military and non-military conditions sustaining the insurgency, and protect US citizens by empowering a competent government. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"terrorist insurgency\" as the use of irregular warfare by transnational criminal organizations to influence public opinion and undermine government control. It also defines \"transnational criminal organization\" as a group operating internationally for power or monetary gain through illegal means, protected by corruption or violence. SEC. 5. COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY AND CONDITIONALITY. Counterinsurgency Strategy: The Secretary of State, with other key officials, must submit a strategy outlining transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, their activities, and assessing Mexico's law enforcement and military capabilities within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. The strategy must address the threat posed by transnational criminal organizations in the United States and at international borders, including trafficking activities, financial networks, and technological advancements. It aims to coordinate with relevant agencies to combat these organizations and isolate them from their power sources to combat the terrorist insurgency in Mexico. The strategy to combat transnational criminal organizations includes increasing the number of Mexican and Central American drug traffickers on the Specially Designated Nationals list, improving cooperation between the Department of Justice and State and local agencies, and enhancing efforts to impact the financial networks of these organizations. The plan includes enhancing cooperation between the Department of Justice, State, and local agencies for firearms law enforcement, implementing a strict accounting procedure for Federal grant assistance, and developing a secure border area at the United States-Mexico border in coordination with Mexico and Homeland Security. This involves doubling the number of Border Patrol agents. The plan involves developing additional infrastructure to support Border Patrol activities along the border, determining necessary technology for reducing unlawful movement at the border, and standardizing the threshold for prosecution of border-related offenses. The plan includes developing a joint US-Mexico program for intelligence gathering, increasing the use of Border Patrol Special Response Teams for high-priority threats, and collaborating with Mexico to develop a multi-agency action plan for security. The military and law enforcement agencies focus on establishing secure areas around key population centers, increasing knowledge of best practices for combating organizations, and securing the environment. They aim to diminish support for transnational criminal organizations. The curr_chunk focuses on combating criminal organizations in Mexico by strengthening governance, promoting safe communities for families and youth, and enhancing local governance institutions. This includes programs to promote a culture of lawfulness, youth programs, anti-drug coalitions, public education, and economic development. The curr_chunk outlines strategies to neutralize transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, including re-evaluating threats, deploying specialized task forces to key regions, seeking support from US military advisors, and assisting Mexican law enforcement operations. The curr_chunk discusses updates required for the counterinsurgency strategy, including reports on extradition requests and extraditions from Mexico and Central America. The Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Secretary of State are responsible for submitting quarterly updates to congressional committees. If the Secretary of State fails to submit the required strategy, 20 percent of funds may be withheld. If the Secretary of State fails to submit the required counterinsurgency strategy, 20 percent of funds for fiscal year 2012 will be withheld until the strategy is submitted. Funds for the Merida Initiative can be used to develop and implement the required counterinsurgency strategy under section 5(a)."
