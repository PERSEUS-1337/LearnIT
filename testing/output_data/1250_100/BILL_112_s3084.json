The VISN Reorganization Act of 2012 establishes 12 Veterans Integrated Service Networks to align with the Department's mission. These networks are responsible for forming alliances with healthcare organizations, managing regional budgets, implementing national metrics for healthcare delivery, and ensuring high-quality clinical programs and services.

Each network has one headquarters co-located with a VA medical center, with limited staff. Annual reports on employment are submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The report includes details on the number of individuals employed at each headquarters of a Veterans Integrated Service Network, positions at the headquarters and those not located there, and the budget impact. Additionally, a triennial review and reassessment of the structure is required every three years. The Secretary conducts a triennial review of the Veterans Integrated Service Networks' structure and operations, submitting recommendations to improve them to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the relevant title. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will consolidate the 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks into 12 geographically defined networks within one year of the enactment of the Act. This includes combining specific networks like VISN 1, VISN 2, and VISN 3 into one network, and VISN 4 and VISN 5 into another.

Measures will be taken to find new positions for individuals affected by the elimination of headquarters. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will relocate headquarters offices of Veterans Integrated Service Networks to be co-located with medical centers or find new positions for affected individuals. An implementation plan must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs within 180 days of the enactment of this Act.
