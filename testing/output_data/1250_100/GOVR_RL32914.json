    "content": "Rising Navy ship procurement costs are a concern for Navy officials and Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Options include increasing funding and changing how ships are funded in the budget. The report discusses options to reduce Navy ship procurement costs, such as using multiyear procurement, changing acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard overhead costs, improving operating efficiency, building ships with less equipment, and shifting to designs with lower unit costs. These measures aim to address rising costs and maintain Navy capabilities. The report explores options for reducing Navy ship procurement costs by considering lower-cost designs for various types of ships. This includes proposals from different organizations like the CBO, DOD's Office of Force Transformation, and the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. One approach is to reduce ship size, as smaller ships tend to have lower procurement costs. The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is an example of this strategy, being considerably smaller than existing major Navy surface combatants. The Navy is considering cost-saving strategies for ship procurement, such as shifting to conventional propulsion, using commercial-like hulls, and employing a common hull design for multiple ship classes. These measures can significantly reduce procurement costs by several hundred million dollars. The Navy is exploring cost-saving strategies for ship procurement, including using a common hull design for multiple ship classes. The OFT report suggests building four large surface ships with a common merchant-like hull, while the CSBA report proposes using the Navy's LPD-17 class amphibious ship design for other ships. Lower-cost ship options derived from these approaches may be less capable individually but offer cost savings. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. They plan to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. Options for lower-cost designs include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. Maintaining the current procurement rate could result in a decrease in the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The Navy plans to reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030 before stabilizing at 33 boats. Lower-cost options include non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems or reduced-cost SSNs using \"Tango Bravo\" technologies. AIP-equipped submarines have extended submerged endurance and are being acquired by foreign navies. The Navy is considering acquiring AIP submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The possibility of procuring one Virginia-class boat plus one or more AIP submarines each year is being explored. The cost comparison suggests that four AIP submarines could be procured for the same cost as one Virginia-class submarine. The average unit procurement cost for an AIP submarine is estimated to be around $600 million to $750 million. The U.S. Navy AIP submarine may cost more due to higher capability standards. This could potentially reduce the equal-cost ratio of substitution to three to one or even closer to two to one. As a result, the annual cost of procuring one Virginia-class SSN plus one, two, or three AIP submarines could be equal to or less than that of procuring two Virginia-class boats per year. The Navy and DARPA are pursuing new technologies under the Tango Bravo program to design a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the Virginia Class design. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and production costs, as well as increasing payload volume by overcoming technology barriers in shaftless propulsion and external weapons. The Navy and DARPA are working on the Tango Bravo program to develop a new submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower cost. This submarine would incorporate advanced technologies such as shaftless propulsion, external weapons, and automation to reduce crew workload. If successful, this new submarine could be procured at a rate of two per year, offering a more cost-effective alternative to the Virginia class. The Navy is currently building large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs) with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was procured in FY2001 at a cost of $4.975 billion, but construction costs have since risen to about $6.1 billion. The FY2007-FY2011 FYDP proposes to procure the next carrier. The Navy plans to procure the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, in FY2008 as part of the CVN-21 class. The estimated procurement cost is $10.5 billion, with plans for CVN-78 to enter service in 2015. CVN-79 is scheduled for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019, and CVN-80 in FY2016. Lower-cost options include designing a medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carrier based on the LHA-6 design or a commercial-like hull. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. It also suggested acquiring four medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carriers based on the LHA(R) design, with a unit procurement cost of roughly $3 billion. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons, embarking a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons, embarking a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft\u201430 Joint Strike Fighters (JSFs) and 6 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft\u2014and 15 unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This ship would be somewhat larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier recommended in the CSBA report, and roughly the same size as the United Kingdom's new aircraft carrier design. The report also suggested an alternative small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull, capable of carrying 10 manned aircraft, 8 JSFs, 2 MV-22s, and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. The OFT report recommended a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons, embarking a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft\u201430 Joint Strike Fighters (JSFs) and 6 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft\u2014and 15 unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This ship would be larger than Thailand's aircraft carrier and smaller than Spain's or the UK's existing carriers. The recommended ship would be much faster than any other aircraft carrier in operation. Studies have discussed other potential designs, including a large conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull with a half-sized version of the CVN-78 nuclear propulsion plant. It might displace about 40,000 tons and embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs. Costing over $3 billion, it is similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. Additionally, a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters was also proposed. The table shows different options for aircraft carriers based on size, propulsion type, and hull type. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, while smaller carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy has procured nuclear-powered cruisers in the past, and while examples of small nuclear-powered carriers are not provided in the table, they are possible. The Navy plans to procure 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) based on the DDG-1000 design. The DDG-1000 would be 50% larger than current Aegis cruisers and destroyers, making it the largest U.S. Navy destroyer or cruiser since the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9). The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the DDG-1000 being 50% larger than current Aegis cruisers. The estimated cost for the DDG-1000s is $3.3 billion each for the first two ships and $2.5 billion each for the following ships. The Navy originally planned to acquire 16 to 24 DDG-1000s but now plans to procure a total of 7 as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year for FY2007-FY2011. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include a cruiser-destroyer, a frigate, and a gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. A new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, known as the smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD), could be a lower-cost alternative to the current DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate advanced technologies, have a reduced crew size for lower operational costs, and carry a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Aegis cruisers or destroyers. A smaller, less expensive new-design ship called the FFG(X) has been suggested as an alternative to the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. The FFG(X) could displace about 6,000 tons and have a unit procurement cost of around $800 million. It may not be equipped with the Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) like the DDG-1000, but could perform non-gunfire missions similar to both the DDG-1000 and LCS. The FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers, with a displacement of 6,000 tons. Another option is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship, estimated to cost about $1.9 billion for the initial ship. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its fleet, with a target procurement cost of $220 million per ship. The LCS program may have an average ship procurement cost of $387 million. An alternative option proposed is a 1,000-ton surface combatant with similar capabilities to the LCS. The OFT report recommended alternative ship designs for lower-cost options, including a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be transported by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for a proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The cost implications, technical risks, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base need to be assessed for these potential designs. The cost implications of planned ship designs include development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Stopping a current program for a lower-cost design could save money in the long run if the new design is procured in large numbers. The earlier a program is stopped, the sooner a lower-cost alternative could reach the break-even point. Using similar technologies can also reduce costs. By using similar technologies and building more ships to the same design, the cost of developing a new ship design can be significantly reduced through the learning curve process. If a lower-cost design can be procured at a faster rate than the currently planned design, it could benefit from greater spreading of the shipyard's annual fixed overhead costs. The lower-cost ship design could benefit from spreading shipyard overhead costs and moving down the learning curve more quickly. Navy ships have high operating costs and can remain in service for many years, with life-cycle operating costs sometimes exceeding procurement costs. Reducing crew size through automation can help lower operating costs, even if it increases initial procurement expenses. The cost of added technology on a ship can increase procurement costs if it outweighs the savings from building extra crew-related spaces. Maintenance costs are a significant factor in ship operating costs, and reducing them may involve using more durable but expensive materials or increasing the size of certain ship spaces for easier maintenance access. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs but higher life-cycle operating costs. Nuclear-powered ships have different cost considerations due to the inclusion of nuclear fuel core costs in their procurement. The cost of a nuclear-powered ship includes the nuclear fuel core loaded during construction. In 2004, a nuclear-powered attack submarine's core cost $158 million for a 33-year lifespan, while a carrier's core cost $300 million for half of its 50-year lifespan. This difference in fuel costs results in a smaller overall cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships. The cost-effectiveness of nuclear-powered ships compared to conventionally powered ships depends on the price of oil. Higher oil costs make nuclear power more attractive. However, nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel and transport the reactor compartment. The cost of nuclear-powered ships varies depending on the type, with a submarine costing $30-35 million and a carrier costing around $570 million. Lower-cost ship designs are generally less capable, but exceptions like the Tango Bravo SSN exist. Ship capability factors include payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and numbers in naval operations. As ship size decreases, payload decreases proportionately, impacting overall capability. As ship size increases, the propulsion plant size increases less than proportionately, allowing for more payload capacity. For example, a smaller carrier can carry fewer aircraft with less total weight compared to a larger carrier. Transferring an air wing from a medium-sized carrier to a larger carrier can increase the number of sorties per day due to the larger flight deck and fuel capacity. Reducing ship size can limit equipment capabilities and increase total costs. Smaller carriers may not support certain aircraft, while smaller surface combatants may lack essential systems. Decreasing ship size can raise procurement and operation costs if payload and crew/fuel requirements do not decrease proportionately. The OFT report addresses some of these concerns. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload capacity for recommended surface combatants. Improvements in precision-guidance technology allow for smaller weapons with the same effectiveness. Supporters of larger ships claim they can be as stealthy as smaller ships. Supporters of larger ships argue that they are better able to withstand hits and continue operations, while supporters of smaller ships believe in overwhelming the enemy with a large number of targets. Some argue that fleet survivability is more important than individual-ship survivability, with a larger number of smaller ships potentially offering superior overall fleet survivability. There is a concern that using expensive Navy ships in high-threat situations may reduce their effectiveness if they are heavily damaged or sunk. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant changes its mobility and operational capabilities significantly. Nuclear power is seen as essential for true submarines, as it allows for extended operations below the surface. AIP systems like fuel-cells or closed-cycle diesel engines extend the submerged endurance of non-nuclear submarines. A conventional diesel-electric sub has a few days of submerged endurance, while an AIP-equipped sub can last up to two or three weeks. However, high-speed endurance remains limited for non-nuclear subs due to battery capacity. In contrast, nuclear-powered subs can stay submerged for weeks or months, with endurance limited by food supply. Non-nuclear submarines with AIP systems have limited high-speed submerged endurance, making them unsuitable for long, completely stealthy transits or extended submerged periods in theater of operations. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines on a transport ship to overseas theaters, acknowledging that their presence may be known. In contrast, SSNs in carrier strike groups can be detached and redirected to different theaters without alerting others. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group would depend on its day-to-day operations and ability to achieve military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. Nuclear-powered carriers have significant advantages, such as high-speed transits without the need for refueling, allowing immediate combat operations upon arrival. Advocates of higher-speed ships argue that their increased capability allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. Skeptics question the benefits of speeds over 30 knots. Advocates of a larger fleet with lower-cost designs argue for increased presence in multiple locations and better crisis response. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that having more ships, even if less capable, allows for better flexibility in responding to crises in multiple locations. They believe that increasing the number of ships in the fleet enhances the overall capability of the force through network-centric warfare. On the other hand, defenders of a smaller fleet with more expensive ships argue that deploying high-quality ships to various locations is more valuable than having a larger number of less-capable designs. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships enhances overall capability through network-centric warfare. They believe that deploying high-quality ships to various locations is more valuable than having a larger number of less-capable designs. Some lower-cost options with technical risks for the Navy include the AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarine, the Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine, and the 13,500-ton ship. The 13,500-ton high-speed carrier and smaller surface combatants with new technologies may offer wider homeporting possibilities. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships is more complex due to unique requirements. Forward-homeporting in foreign countries can be challenging for nuclear-powered ships. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the shipbuilding industrial base. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work depending on funding availability. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leading to no substantial change in shipbuilding work, reduced total volume if costs are lowered for the same number of ships, or an increase in funding if lower-cost designs make Navy ships more cost-effective, enabling an increase in ship procurement. The availability of lower-cost ship designs for Navy ship procurement could increase the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work. This could impact the distribution of work among shipyards, particularly for building Attack submarines like the Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine and AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines. The involvement of different shipyards such as General Dynamics' Electric Boat, Northrop Grumman Newport News, and Ingalls shipyard could change the division of work for building submarines. If AIP submarines were procured instead of nuclear-powered submarines, it could impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the only yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in merchant-like hulls. Small, high-speed carriers using an SES/catamaran hull design could be constructed at various yards. If conventionally powered carriers were procured instead of nuclear-powered carriers, it could reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant is equivalent to five submarine nuclear propulsion plants in terms of work provided. Larger surface combatants like DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Smaller surface combatants like the LCS will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA shipyard. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about rising costs and production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. They believe there is an over-reliance on individual ''mega'' systems that are potentially more expensive and time-consuming to develop than less sophisticated but capable systems. The committee has proposed limitations on procurement costs for specific classes of ships and the establishment of a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about rising costs and production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. They believe there is an over-reliance on individual ''mega'' systems that are potentially more expensive and time-consuming to develop than less sophisticated but capable systems. This situation creates a ''high demand, low density'' scenario, increasing stress on military personnel and limiting the strategic depth of United States forces. The committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, stating that it was developed using unrealistic assumptions that may not be executable. The Navy's shipbuilding plan requires a significant increase in funds, but obtaining them during federal spending reductions will be challenging. The plan assumes ship acquisition programs can avoid cost growth, but the committee is concerned about affordability and excess capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee is deeply concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting inaccuracies and exclusions in prior estimates. They recommend revising the process to ensure all major known elements of ship cost are included. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill would impose cost limitations on three Navy shipbuilding programs. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes and submit them for review by the Under Secretary of Defense. A report on the DDG-1000 program is also required. The committee expressed concerns about the affordability of the DDG-1000 program, stating that the Navy may not be able to design and build the lead ships within budget. They suggested reducing the number of next-generation destroyers to make the program more affordable. The committee supports building up to two DD(X) ships to demonstrate technologies for future, more cost-effective surface combatants. The budget request lacked funds for maritime technology in shipbuilding efficiency measures. The committee supports the maritime technology program to reduce naval ship construction costs and improve efficiency. They encourage expanding efforts to all ship procurements and have created a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The committee supports a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity and cost effectiveness. This program aims to lower Navy ship procurement costs and improve competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. Additionally, the committee recommends $120.0 million for the maritime technology program and highlights the importance of the national shipbuilding research program for collaborative process improvements. The committee recommends funding for the national shipbuilding research program, shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants, and shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the United States shipbuilding industry. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding for aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The committee received testimony from the Navy and industry regarding the low rate of shipbuilding driving higher costs, leading to a downward spiral. Stable ship requirements, increased funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships are crucial to reversing this trend. Concerns were raised about cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with recommendations to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder proposed savings through a stable procurement plan and economic order quantity material procurement for future carriers. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. A report outlining advance procurement requirements for the first three vessels of the CVN-21 class is to be submitted with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. None of the funds for advance procurement for CVN-79 and CVN-80 are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the report. The procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to escalation impacts, increased labor hours, overhead rates, and schedule delays. Additional funding for CVN-77 cost growth will be included in future budget requests. The Navy has implemented management actions to control costs on CVN-77, but projections show costs exceeding the baseline cap by over 30%. The committee emphasizes the need for improved visibility into completion costs to assess the effectiveness of these actions and enhance future affordability. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit quarterly reports to congressional defense committees regarding the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract cost details. The report also highlights cost risks in the Littoral Combat Ship program and emphasizes the importance of cost control through competition and commonality. The committee is concerned about apparent cost growth and lack of clear acquisition strategy in the LCS program. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report outlining the acquisition strategy by December 1, 2006. The report to the congressional defense committees outlines the Navy's acquisition strategy for the LCS program, including competition, flight, and cost containment plans. It also includes R&D and procurement costs, as well as life cycle costs for two different LCS designs. The report highlights the importance of the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise in reducing shipyard costs and improving efficiency through collaboration between the Navy and industry. The committee emphasizes the program's positive impact on naval warship construction affordability and efficiency. The committee recommends increasing funding for NSRP-ASE by $10.0 million to support efforts in developing a skilled workforce, establishing a national supply chain, exploring new markets for shipbuilders, and improving computer interoperability. Additionally, H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and establishes cost caps for procurement. The legislation includes procurement cost caps for various naval vessels, funding for shipbuilding technology proposals, and a directive for the Navy to assess construction efficiencies. The caps can be adjusted for inflation. The Secretary is required to report any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs. The conferees acknowledge the uncertainties in completing the design and construction of the CVN-21 class, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks. Compliance with this provision may require trade-offs in procurement costs that could impact system performance, safety, and other factors in the project. The conferees acknowledge uncertainties in completing the design and construction of the CVN-21 class, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks. The Secretary must notify the Committees on Armed Services of any cost-driven reduction that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or meeting the requirements of the CVN-21 Operational Requirements Document. The amendment does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program of record. The conferees understand uncertainties in completing the design and construction of the LHA-6 ship, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within budget estimates, which may require procurement cost trade-offs impacting various aspects of the ship's design and construction. The conferees believe that trade-offs in the LHA Replacement program will be managed by the program office. The Secretary must notify Congress before making any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety or crew quality of life. The House Appropriations Committee emphasizes the importance of cost control in Navy shipbuilding plans, but notes a lack of specific initiatives to meet cost targets. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop initiatives for cost control, and sign contracts to prevent cost growth in shipbuilding programs. The report recommended reducing Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on prior year's ships. Concerns remain over lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs, with a gap between public statements and actions needed for firm cost controls. Navy briefings highlight cost overruns in programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class submarines exceeding cost estimates. Congressional legislation is needed to raise cost caps on these programs. The Committee is hesitant to provide additional funding without a detailed plan for cost control. Funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs has been reduced by $141.4 million. The Navy is experiencing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, particularly with the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class submarines exceeding cost estimates. Congressional legislation is required to raise cost caps on these programs. Funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs has been reduced by $141.4 million, with potential options including increasing annual ship-procurement funding or reallocating funds from other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with options to address the issue including modifying funding for new Navy ships, using incremental funding or advance appropriations, and implementing multiyear procurement contracts. These options may increase the number of ships procured but could also pose challenges related to Congressional oversight and flexibility in adjusting procurement plans. The Navy is considering various options to address cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, including modifying funding for new ships and changing acquisition strategies. One option is to shift to a single-yard acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, which could reduce costs but may limit competition and innovation in design. Another option is to increase competition in Navy ship acquisition to control costs and ensure quality. The Navy is considering increasing competition in ship acquisition programs to control costs and ensure quality. This could involve using competition between shipyards to award contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. However, this approach requires a high annual procurement rate or the possibility of a yard permanently withdrawing from building that type of ship. Another option is to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs to lower procurement costs. The Navy is exploring ways to reduce procurement costs of Navy ships by eliminating excess capacity in shipyards, increasing other forms of work, and improving operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to enhance efficiency. A DOD report from May 2005 compares the operating efficiency of U.S. shipyards with foreign shipyards and provides recommendations for improvement. The Navy is exploring ways to reduce procurement costs of Navy ships by improving operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. One option is to build Navy ships without some planned equipment, which may reduce capabilities but defer costs. Another option is to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards where construction costs may be lower due to lower wages and materials. The Navy is considering building ships in foreign shipyards to reduce costs, but 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits construction of vessels for the armed forces in foreign shipyards unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. The provision also restricts funds for Navy shipbuilding to be used in foreign facilities for major construction. The Navy is exploring building ships in foreign shipyards to cut costs, but 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits this unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. Funds for Navy shipbuilding cannot be used in foreign facilities for major construction. RAND Corporation report discusses reasons for increased Navy ship costs and cost reduction options."
