    "title": "AB 2488",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the importance of the Foothill Feeder as a primary water conduit for southern California served by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Water from the State Water Project is crucial for the region's water supply, and interruptions must be minimized to ensure clean and reliable water for municipal and industrial uses. The Foothill Feeder is essential for southern California's water supply, and periodic maintenance may require dewatering into the Santa Clara River, potentially impacting the unarmored threespine stickleback. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must consult with wildlife agencies for mitigation measures. A new section in the Fish and Game Code addresses these concerns. The Fish and Game Code now includes Section 2081.10, allowing the department to authorize the incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback during maintenance of the Foothill Feeder water supply facility in Southern California, subject to specific conditions. The take authorization allows for the development of an adaptive management plan to minimize impacts on unarmored threespine stickleback during activities at the Foothill Feeder water supply facility in Southern California. A biologist with experience in evaluating inland fisheries impacts must be present during relevant activities. The Metropolitan Water District consults with the department to consider feasible measures to avoid incidental take of the stickleback. The take authorization covers various locations along the Santa Clara River and its tributaries, allowing for incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback during mitigation or conservation actions. The permit issued for the Foothill Feeder repair project includes conditions for handling stranded fish, dewatering the feeder, and mimicking streamflows. These conditions must comply with the project description and environmental impact report. The section does not exempt the periodic maintenance of the Foothill Feeder from other laws. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must report to the department after every dewatering of the Foothill Feeder, addressing compliance with permit conditions and the effectiveness of the adaptive management plan for conservation. Reports must be made available to the public. \"Modification\" does not include expanding the feeder's water delivery capacity. The department may authorize the taking of a fully protected fish for scientific research purposes, including efforts to recover threatened or endangered species. Notification will be published for affected parties to provide relevant information within 30 days. The California Regulatory Notice Register publishes information and comments on proposed authorizations. The California Fish and Game Code lists fully protected fish species that require a permit for possession. Scientific research excludes actions for project mitigation. The California Fish and Game Code prohibits the taking or possession of fully protected fish, except for authorized scientific research purposes. The department must notify affected parties and solicit comments before authorizing the take of a fully protected fish. After notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register, relevant information and comments on the proposed authorization are sought. Fully protected fish under a permit issued by the department include Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens River pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended. The Department may authorize the taking of fully protected fish for scientific research or species recovery efforts after notifying affected parties and soliciting comments. No permit or license shall be issued for taking fully protected fish except for these purposes. After notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register, relevant information and comments on the proposed authorization can be provided. Fully protected fish under a permit issued by the department include Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended. Fully protected fish cannot be taken or possessed, except for scientific research purposes authorized by the department after notifying affected parties. After notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register, relevant information and comments on the proposed authorization can be provided. Fully protected fish under a permit issued by the department include Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin. Section 4 of the bill outlines conditions for the incorporation of proposed amendments to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code from Assembly Bills 1845 and 2001. The operative status of the amendments is contingent on the enactment and effectiveness of both bills before January 1, 2017, and the sequence of enactment if this bill is passed after either Assembly Bill. Section 3.3 of the bill includes amendments to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code from Assembly Bills 1845 and 2001. It will only take effect if all three bills are enacted by January 1, 2017, and if this bill is enacted after the other two."
