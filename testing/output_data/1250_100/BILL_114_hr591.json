    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, national security, and the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the development of tools and technologies for engineering biology, as other countries are also investing in this field. The United States risks losing its competitive edge in engineering biology without necessary investment and a national strategy. A National Engineering Biology Initiative can establish new research directions, improve coordination, drive technology transfer, and optimize Federal investment returns. The Act defines key terms such as \"Advisory Committee,\" \"biomanufacturing,\" and \"engineering biology.\" It also establishes the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity through research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, supporting social science research, expanding researchers with engineering biology training, accelerating commercialization of research, and improving interagency coordination. Program activities include sustained support for research through grants to individual investigators. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program supports research in biological, physical, and information sciences through grants, interdisciplinary teams, joint projects, and research centers. It also focuses on educating students, tracking economic benefits, and accelerating commercialization through precompetitive research opportunities and public-private partnerships. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to expand opportunities by facilitating public-private partnerships, connecting researchers with entrepreneurship education, supporting proof of concept activities, and forming startup companies. It also focuses on outreach to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions, promoting research collaborations, and addressing ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program addresses ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues by supporting research and ensuring public input through mechanisms like citizen panels and consensus conferences. An interagency committee on engineering biology is designated by the President. The interagency committee on engineering biology, including representatives from various agencies, oversees the planning, management, and coordination of the Program. It provides for interagency coordination, establishes goals and priorities, and develops a strategic plan every 5 years. The interagency committee on engineering biology oversees the Program, establishing goals and priorities every 5 years. The Program supports interdisciplinary research, education, outreach, societal issues, and moving results into application. It proposes an interagency budget to maintain a robust research portfolio and ensure funding balance. The Interagency Committee oversees the Program, developing plans to utilize Federal programs and considering recommendations from various groups. It prepares an annual report on the Program budget for the fiscal year. The Interagency Committee oversees the Program, developing plans to utilize Federal programs and considering recommendations from various groups. It prepares an annual report on the Program budget for the fiscal year, including a breakdown of agency spending and an assessment of how Federal agencies are implementing the plan, along with details on Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors. The committee will assess progress, revise the program as needed, evaluate funding balance, and ensure ethical and societal issues are addressed. Reports are to be submitted every 3 years after enactment of the Act. The advisory committee on engineering biology research and development will report findings and recommendations every 3 years to relevant congressional committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this committee. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations for addressing research needs. A summary report of the workshop findings will be transmitted to relevant congressional committees within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The National Science Foundation will support basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provide research instrumentation support, and award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce will establish a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials and measurements for engineering biology and biomanufacturing. The Department of Energy will conduct research in engineering biology disciplines such as synthetic biology, biofuel development, and environmental remediation. They will also provide access to advanced facilities for industry, education institutions, and government agencies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct research in engineering biology fields, including synthetic biology, related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. They will also award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to conduct research in an industry setting. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on how engineering biology products, processes, and systems will impact the environment."
