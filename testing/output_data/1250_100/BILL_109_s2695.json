    "content": "The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006, also known as the FRPAA, emphasizes the importance of sharing research findings funded by the Federal Government to advance science and benefit society. The Act defines a \"Federal agency\" as an Executive agency under section 105 of title 5, United States Code. It aims to make research information promptly available to scientists, physicians, educators, and citizens through the Internet. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies with research expenditures over $100,000,000 to develop a public access policy for research papers. This policy includes submitting final manuscripts of research papers to the agency, incorporating peer review changes, and providing free online access to the final published version. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates Federal agencies to provide free online access to final peer-reviewed manuscripts within 6 months of publication, create an online bibliography linking to full texts, and preserve research findings in digital repositories. The policy applies to researchers employed by the Federal agency with works in the public domain. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies to make final peer-reviewed manuscripts freely available online within 6 months of publication. The policy applies to works in the public domain and excludes certain types of research materials. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates Federal agencies to provide free online access to peer-reviewed research papers funded by the agency. Agencies must submit an annual report on the effectiveness of the policy to specific Congressional committees. The Federal agency is required to provide a list of research papers funded by them, along with papers made available as per the public access policy, and a summary of the time between publication and online availability. This information must be posted on the agency's website for public access."
