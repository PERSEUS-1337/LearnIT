    "content": "The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, protects federal interest computers from trespassing, threats, damage, espionage, and fraud. It fills gaps in other criminal laws and has been amended over the years. CFAA focuses on computers as victims, while other laws address computers in different contexts. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, outlines various offenses related to computer trespassing, damage, fraud, threats, espionage, and trafficking in passwords. The Act also addresses attempts or conspiracies to commit these offenses, with penalties ranging from imprisonment for up to a year for certain violations. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, outlines offenses related to computer trespassing, damage, fraud, threats, espionage, and trafficking in passwords. Penalties range from imprisonment for up to a year to life imprisonment for certain offenses. The Act also includes provisions for investigative authority, definitions, civil cause of action for victims, and confiscation of property related to the offenses. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, prohibits unauthorized intrusion into federal government computers, whether exclusively used by the government or shared with others. It also criminalizes attempted intrusions and conspiracies to intrude. Unauthorized access to government computers is illegal if it affects their use by or for the government. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. 1030, prohibits unauthorized intrusion into federal government computers, whether exclusively used by the government or shared with others. It also criminalizes attempted intrusions and conspiracies to intrude. The legislation clarifies that unauthorized access affecting government computer use is illegal. The act specifically targets intentional trespassing on federal computers, requiring more than just inadvertent entry. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits unauthorized intrusion into federal government computers, targeting intentional trespassing and requiring more than inadvertent entry. Congress aimed to prosecute those purposefully accessing government computers without authorization, while also protecting whistleblowers and balancing the need to prevent criminal conduct by authorized users. The Committee balanced the need to protect Government computers from abuse by outsiders with concerns for Federal employees and authorized users. They decided not to criminalize acts where an employee exceeds authorized access to department computers, opting for administrative sanctions instead of criminal punishment to avoid unnecessary prosecution. The Committee amended the subsection to prevent prosecution of individuals who exceed authorized access within their department, distinguishing between unauthorized access within a department and trespasses into computers of another department. They aim to handle such cases with administrative sanctions rather than criminal punishment. The Committee limited 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(3) to cases where the offender is completely outside the Government or where the offender's act of trespass is interdepartmental in nature. They do not intend to preclude prosecution if an employee accesses another department's computer without authorization. Serious intradepartmental trespass cases may not be prosecuted under (a)(3) but could be subject to other criminal penalties. The legislation prohibits trespassing on governmental computer space that affects government use or use for governmental purposes. The Department of Justice has concerns about the language requiring a difficult task for prosecutors to prove offender's conduct. The reports provide little insight into which computers are protected. The legislation prohibits trespassing on government computers, specifically those owned or leased by the federal government. It also covers nonpublic government computers used for nongovernmental purposes. The statute addresses key questions regarding the scope of protection for government computers. The legislation prohibits trespassing on government computers, including nonpublic government computers used for nongovernmental purposes. It defines \"department of the United States\" and \"agency of the United States\" and raises questions about the jurisdiction of paragraph 1030(a)(3) in cases of hacking. The paragraph discusses the application of federal laws to hacking activities occurring overseas. Federal laws generally apply within the United States, but there are exceptions when Congress explicitly states otherwise or when the nature of the offense suggests overseas application. For example, the Supreme Court ruled that fraud against the federal government committed abroad by Americans falls under federal law. In the cybercrime context, a court applied a statute prohibiting unauthorized computer access to defraud to a hacker in Russia. The court applied a statute prohibiting unauthorized computer access to defraud to a hacker in Russia who gained unauthorized access to \"protected computers\" in the United States. Congress amended the definition of \"protected computers\" to include those used in foreign commerce or communications, granting extraterritorial jurisdiction over computer-related offenses. Congress did not explicitly provide extraterritorial jurisdiction for simple trafficking offenses under the statute. The penalties for conspiracy to violate, or for violations of, paragraph 1030(a)(3) include imprisonment and fines. Other paragraphs may trigger forfeiture, restitution, and civil liability provisions. The forfeiture provisions allow confiscation of a cyber trespasser's property. The penalties for violating paragraph 1030(a)(3) include imprisonment and fines, with forfeiture provisions allowing confiscation of a cyber trespasser's property. Federal authorities historically did not prosecute juvenile offenders, but most federal crimes, including computer hacking, are crimes under state laws. Prosecutions under paragraph 1030(a)(3) have been relatively few, as it tracks closely with paragraph 1030(a)(2) which is reserved for more serious cases. Attempting to hack into a federal computer in violation of paragraph 1030(a)(3) is also punishable as a federal crime. In federal law, attempting to violate paragraph 1030(a)(3) is punishable as a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. 1030(b). To convict someone of attempt, the government must prove intent and a substantial step towards the offense. The line between preparation and a substantial step varies by case. Courts have offered varying descriptions of the location of conspiracy to violate federal law. If individuals agree to access a government computer without authorization and take affirmative action, they are guilty of conspiracy. Prosecution for violating paragraph 1030(a)(3) can occur if one conspirator hacks into a government computer. Subsection 1030(b) punishes conspiracy to commit subsection 1030(a) offenses. Prosecution under subsection 1030(b) does not require proof of an overt act like general conspiracy prosecutions under Section 371. Section 371 punishes conspiracy to commit any federal felony with imprisonment for not more than 5 years, regardless of the maximum term of imprisonment for the underlying offense. In contrast, subsection 1030(b) contemplates punishing conspiracy and the underlying violation of subsection 1030(a) similarly. Anyone who aids or abets a federal crime is liable as a principal for the offense to the same extent as the individual who commits it. The liability of accomplices in criminal offenses is discussed, with a focus on subsection 1030(b) which outlaws attempts to violate subsection 1030(a). Accomplices may be liable as principals or accessories before the fact for completed crimes. Even if a crime does not succeed beyond the attempt phase, aiding or abetting can still lead to conviction. Computer trespassing, as outlined in paragraph 1030(a)(3), is less likely to overlap with other laws compared to other offenses in subsection 1030(a). The government may be implicated in hacking offenses under various laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1030 and 2701. Misidentifying oneself to access a federal computer could violate 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 912, but proving adverse impact on a governmental agency is challenging. The impersonation statute, 18 U.S.C. 912, requires proof of an official act or fraud for conviction. Section 912 of the impersonation statute, like 18 U.S.C. 1001, may be used in cases falling under paragraph 1030(a)(4) for unauthorized computer access. Simple computer trespassing is also a crime under state anti-hacking laws. The statute punishes intentional unauthorized access to obtain information from financial records, government departments, or protected computers. The prohibition against acquiring protected information by unauthorized computer access is punishable under subsection (c). It can be challenging to differentiate between simple trespass and trespassing with information acquisition on government computers. The history of trespass provisions aims to exempt whistleblowers from simple trespassing charges. While paragraph 1030(a)(3) lacks an \"exceeds-authorized-access\" provision, paragraph 1030(a)(2) includes it and may apply to whistleblowers. The courts will determine if paragraph 1030(a)(2) effectively amends paragraph 1030(a)(3) or reconciles the two. The government must prove that the defendant intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization to sustain a conviction under paragraph 1030(a)(2). The intent requirement is the same as that required in the case of simple trespassing. The courts have had difficulty applying the terms \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" in paragraph 1030(a)(2) of 18 U.S.C. 1030. Some have interpreted \"exceeds authorized access\" to apply to unauthorized use by authorized employees or outsiders with limited access. One court found breaching a website's terms of service could potentially constitute unauthorized access. However, this interpretation was deemed unconstitutionally vague. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) expands on the concept of unauthorized access, covering a wider range of computers and types of information, including federal government data, financial information, and data from protected computers. The protection for financial information was one of the first adjustments made to the legislation, aimed at safeguarding privacy in credit records and customer relationships with financial institutions. The Right to Financial Privacy Act aims to extend privacy protections to all customers of financial institutions, not just individuals or small partnerships. The Department of Justice has raised concerns about the interpretation of 'obtains information' in the statute, clarifying that it includes mere observation of data and does not require physical removal or transcription of data. The committee explanation of the language amending paragraph 1030(a)(2) endorsed the reading that 'obtaining information' includes merely reading it, without the need for copying or transporting it. This interpretation is consistent with congressional intent and aims to protect against the theft of information stored electronically. Theft of intangible information through unauthorized computer use is prohibited under subsection 1030(a)(2)(C) to protect against abuse of computer systems. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 expanded the scope to include computers affecting interstate or foreign commerce, allowing authorities to address hacking crimes within the same state. The expansion of the definition of \"protected computer\" under the USA PATRIOT Act includes computers with a de minimis impact on commerce, such as those accessing the Internet. It raises questions about the extraterritorial application of unauthorized access to federal computers overseas. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) offenses carry criminal penalties and other consequences, with a three-tier sentencing structure. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) establishes a three-tier sentencing structure for offenses related to unauthorized access to federal computers. The first tier involves misdemeanors with penalties of imprisonment for up to one year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 ($200,000 for organizations). The second tier, added in 1996, carries penalties of imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations) for offenses committed for commercial advantage, financial gain, or exceeding $5,000 in value. The terms used in defining these offenses are borrowed from copyright and wiretap laws. The phrases in question in paragraph 1030(a)(2) contemplate criminal, tortious, or financially advantageous purposes beyond computer trespassing. The value of information acquired by a hacker may be assessed based on the cost of production. Repeat offenders face increased punishment of up to 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations) for a second or subsequent conviction. Federal law does not favor prosecuting juveniles for intrusion and information acquisition offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(2) unless the state is unable to proceed. The Sentencing Guidelines ensure consistent penalties for federal crimes based on offense seriousness. Each federal crime is assigned a base offense level, with adjustments for circumstances, resulting in a sentencing range. Violations of paragraph 1030(a)(2) are governed by U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1 with a base offense level of 6. The Tenth Circuit's opinion in Willis illustrates the sentencing process for violations of paragraph 1030(a)(2) under U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1. The District Court enhanced Mr. Willis's offense level due to foreseeable losses exceeding $10,000, using means of identification, and abusing a position of trust. This resulted in a 41-month imprisonment sentence. Recent Guidelines also include enhancements for critical infrastructure computer offenses and personal information acquisition. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 added criminal and civil forfeiture provisions to Section 1030, allowing confiscation of property derived from violations. Restitution is mandatory for certain federal crimes, but not for acquisition offenses under 1030(a)(2). The discretionary restitution provisions under Section 1030 have limitations on the type of losses for which restitution may be ordered, except in cases of plea bargains or when ordered as a condition of probation. However, restitution may be required when a victim of a computer security breach incurs pecuniary losses related to the investigation. Subsection 1030(g) allows for compensatory damages and injunctive relief for victims of \u00a71030 violations resulting in specified losses exceeding $5,000. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act allows for restitution in cases where there is loss or damage, including physical injury, threats to public health or safety, and damage to government computer systems. Victims can combine their losses to meet the $5,000 threshold, and any violation of the Act can suffice for restitution. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act allows for restitution in cases of loss or damage, with the USA PATRIOT Act defining \"person\" broadly to include individuals, firms, corporations, and governmental entities. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act allows for restitution in cases of loss or damage, including costs related to responding to an offense, conducting damage assessment, and restoring data. Compensatory damages are limited to economic damages, with a two-year statute of limitations for suits. Conspirators or those who aid in violating the Act are subject to the same penalties as those who commit the offense. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act does not require larcenous intent like other federal conversion statutes. It provides prosecutors with a more serious charge against hackers who breach governmental systems, giving the government an alternative charge against hackers who steal information. Victims have similar options for civil litigation under this provision. Paragraph 1030(a)(2) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act expands on paragraph 1030(a)(3) by including an information acquisition element and broader jurisdiction. It may overlap with false statement and false identification statutes, as well as communication protection provisions when unauthorized computer access intrudes on wire or electronic communications. This paragraph protects information from \"protected computers\" used in interstate and foreign commerce. The USA PATRIOT Act amendment allows for the protection of computer information located overseas if it involves or affects foreign commerce or communications of the United States. The theft of information stored in a computer may be prosecuted under specific federal theft statutes only if there is a physical connection between the stolen information and a physical item transported interstate. Prosecuting computer intrusions under federal theft statutes requires a physical connection between stolen information and a physical item transported interstate. The theft of government property statute, 18 U.S.C. 641, is a better match as it outlaws the misappropriation of any \"thing of value\" belonging to the federal government. This statute requires proof that the defendant stole or converted something of value belonging to the United States with the intent to deprive the owner of its use or benefit. The Economic Espionage Act criminalizes computerized burglary in a commercial setting when trade secrets are involved. It requires the stolen information to have a nexus to interstate or foreign commerce, be a secret, and have trade value. The act is effective in protecting trade secrets by making it a federal crime to steal or receive such information knowingly. The Economic Espionage Act criminalizes computerized burglary in a commercial setting to protect trade secrets, including various types of information. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine. Unauthorized downloading of information may also violate copyright law. Copyright law prohibits three forms of willful copyright infringement: (A) infringement for \"commercial advantage or private financial gain\"; (B) infringement by reproduction or distribution of protected works worth over $1,000; and (C) infringement by distributing works intended for commercial distribution on a computer network. Each form of infringement carries penalties under 18 U.S.C. 2319, with prison terms ranging from 1 to 10 years. Fines can reach up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. The principal federal money laundering statutes, 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957, outlaw various financial activities involving proceeds from federal crimes, with penalties of up to $100,000 ($200,000 for organizations). Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are money laundering predicate offenses, with penalties for causing damage to a protected computer without authorization. Paragraph 1030(a)(5) establishes three computer damage offenses, distinguishable by the offender's intent to intrude and cause damage: intentionally causing damage without authorization, recklessly causing damage by unauthorized access, and causing damage and loss by unauthorized access. This provision, added in 1996 and amended in subsequent acts, holds individuals accountable for any resulting damage from intentional unauthorized access, regardless of intent. The intentional damage offense in subparagraph 1030(a)(5)(A) prohibits knowing transmission of damage, reaching both direct and indirect infliction. The government must prove the defendant sent the transmission, which can include installing a destructive program. The transmission must be done knowingly, but the damage must be intentional. Unauthorized access is mentioned in other paragraphs, but subparagraphs 1030(a)(5)(B) and (C) only refer to unauthorized access, without exceeding authorized access. This difference means only outsiders may violate the reckless provisions. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act expanded the scope of damage offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(5), now covering both serious and less serious computer damage. Serious damage is treated as a felony, while less serious damage is a misdemeanor. Simple damage requires proof of both damage and loss, defined as any impairment to data, a program, system, or information. Unauthorized access alone is not sufficient for a violation, as loss must also be demonstrated. Loss is described as any reasonable cost to any victim, including responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring data. Crimes under paragraph 1030(a)(5) do not require exceeding authorization but condemn unauthorized transmission causing damage, reckless unauthorized access causing damage, and unauthorized access causing damage and loss. Computer damage is a federal crime under paragraph 1030(a)(5) only if it involves a \"protected computer.\" The phrase \"computer ... used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications\" in \u00a71030 refers to computer damage that may impact interstate or foreign commerce or communications. This phrase was added in the 1994 amendments to broaden federal jurisdiction over hackers who may have affected interstate commerce, replacing the previous language regarding computers used in committing offenses across different states. The 1994 amendment to \u00a71030 broadened federal jurisdiction over hackers by including computers used in interstate or foreign commerce. The phrase \"affecting interstate or foreign commerce\" applies to any computer with even a slight impact on interstate or foreign commerce, regardless of internet connection. The scope of protection for government computers under \u00a71030 is unclear, as terms like \"United States Government\" are not defined. The scope of protection for federal computers under \u00a71030 is unclear, as terms like \"United States Government\" are not defined. The definition of financial institutions protected differs slightly from the general definition in Title 18. Congress's mention of overseas computers in the jurisdiction basis raises questions about the application of other jurisdiction bases. The paragraph outlines the punishment for causing serious damage recklessly or intentionally under subparagraph 1030(a)(5)(A). It includes imprisonment for various terms and fines, with harsher penalties for repeat offenders or causing death or serious bodily injury. The punishment for causing serious damage recklessly or intentionally under subparagraph 1030(a)(5)(A) includes imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for an organization) for repeat offenders. For any other violation, the punishment is imprisonment for up to 1 year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 (up to $200,000 for an organization). The punishment for violating subparagraph 1030(a)(5)(C) includes imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for an organization) for intentional access causing damage. Damage thresholds are set at $5,000 or more, with imprisonment for up to 1 year and/or a fine of up to $100,000 (up to $200,000 for an organization) for other violations. The 1996 amendments to the law on computer intrusions aimed to restrict federal felony prosecutions to more serious cases involving economic harm of $1,000 or more in a year. The term \"damage\" was interpreted broadly to include all economic harm caused by intrusions. For example, altering log-on programs to steal user passwords may not physically damage the computer but results in loss to the victim by requiring password changes and system security measures. The bill defines 'damage' in relation to computer intrusions, focusing on the harm to prevent. It emphasizes significant financial losses as a criterion for criminal conduct. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified 'loss' as any reasonable cost to victims, including damage assessment and data restoration. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified that 'loss' includes any reasonable cost to victims, such as damage assessment and data restoration, to reach the $5,000 threshold. It also addressed the issue of defining victims as \"persons\" to include individuals and legal entities, resolving potential limitations on reaching the threshold. The medical tampering element remains unchanged with no monetary threshold. The 1996 amendments added new provisions to address computer tampering that causes physical injuries or threatens public health and safety. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act made it a felony to use spyware or keyloggers to damage 10 or more computers, ensuring harsher punishment for identity thieves. The 1996 amendments added provisions to address computer tampering causing physical injuries or threatening public health. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act made it a felony to use spyware or keyloggers to damage multiple computers, ensuring harsh punishment for identity thieves. In cases of damage offenses under Federal cyber crime laws, juveniles are more likely to face state proceedings. The Sentencing Guidelines play a significant role in damage cases under paragraph 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5), with enhancements for intentional damage infliction and multiple victims. Confiscation of property related to violations of 18 U.S.C. 1030 is common in damage cases. Restitution is mandatory for fraud or property damage offenses. Offenders of paragraph 1030(a)(5) may face civil liability for serious damage caused. Victims have a cause of action for damages within two years. Offenders may also face compensatory damages for damage to medical records or physical injury. The USA PATRIOT Act resolved the question of the definition of \"person\" in relation to violations of 18 U.S.C. 1030, providing clarity on who can be considered a victim entitled to damages for loss or harm. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the definition of \"person\" and \"loss\" in relation to civil liability for violations of 18 U.S.C. 1030. It also specified that subsection 1030(g) does not cover losses due to negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware or software. Additionally, offenses classified as federal crimes of terrorism have specific consequences. Offenses classified as federal crimes of terrorism trigger the application of various criminal statutes, with an 8-year statute of limitations and a life term of supervised release. Bail is unlikely for individuals charged with these crimes, and aggravated identity theft carries a 5-year maximum sentence when related to terrorism. Providing maritime transportation for terrorism is a separate federal crime. Federal crimes of terrorism, including RICO predicate offenses, involve patterned commission of offenses to control an enterprise affecting commerce. Offenders can face up to 20 years in prison and civil liability. Any RICO predicate offense is also a money laundering predicate offense. Attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting are punishable under the law. Other federal statutes may apply to damage or destruction of federal property. The uncertainty lies in whether general statutes can protect intangible property like computer-stored information. Specific means of destruction or protection of certain property types may limit the applicability of existing statutes. Section 2071 criminalizes the unlawful destruction of government records, requiring specific criteria to be met for prosecution. The phrase \"conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy\" in Section 2071 may extend to electronic destruction of computerized records. One court interpreted the statute to prevent any conduct that deprives the Government of the use of its documents, including photocopying. The phrase \"any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with\" covers any item capable of being filed or deposited, including federal computer records. The final requirement of Section 2071 may protect any government record, punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Section 1361 makes it a federal crime to damage US property, with prosecution possible even if the offender did not know the property belonged to the government. There have been cases of prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1030 for electronic computer abuse resulting in damage. The federal statutes protect government property from damage or destruction, with penalties including imprisonment and fines. Section 1362 specifically addresses interference with federal communications systems, punishable by imprisonment and fines. Section 1030 is the only statute that includes provisions to protect financial institutions from property damage. The federal statutes protect government property from damage or destruction, with penalties including imprisonment and fines. Transportation laws cover computerized damage or destruction in interstate commerce, including air, motor, rail, and sea transportation facilities. Provisions protect air traffic control systems and maritime navigational facilities from interference that endangers safety. The federal law protects transportation facilities from interference that endangers safety, with penalties including imprisonment and fines. Attacks on mass transit or navigational facilities can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Federal jurisdiction for prosecution exists if the offense occurs within American territorial waters or involves American vessels or individuals. Computer abuse that damages or destroys motor traffic control systems in a manner threatening human safety falls under federal law 18 U.S.C. 33(a). Other federal crimes may be implicated by damaging computer systems used in interstate or foreign commerce, such as damage to energy facilities or interference with communications or weather satellites. States also outlaw damaging computer equipment, software, or systems. Damage offenses that qualify as federal crimes of terrorism are considered RICO predicate offenses. RICO violations involve conducting business through patterned commission of predicate offenses, punishable by forfeiture of property, imprisonment, and fines. Violators may face civil liability with courts awarding treble damages and may enjoin future activities. Federal money laundering statutes prohibit domestic and international laundering of proceeds from specified unlawful activities. Money laundering statutes prohibit unlawful activities such as international laundering of proceeds, promoting further offenses, and spending over $10,000 of the proceeds. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 involve computer intrusion for fraud, with penalties for accessing a protected computer without authorization. The statute 18 U.S.C. 1030 outlaws fraud by computer intrusion, targeting unauthorized access to protected computers used in interstate or foreign commerce, by the United States Government, or financial institutions. It includes elements of knowingly accessing a protected computer with intent to defraud and obtaining anything of value. Congress expanded the definition of protected computers to include those located outside the United States affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The statute 18 U.S.C. 1030 outlaws fraud by computer intrusion, targeting unauthorized access to protected computers used in interstate or foreign commerce, by the United States Government, or financial institutions. It includes elements of knowingly accessing a protected computer with intent to defraud and obtaining anything of value. Congress expanded the definition of protected computers to include those located outside the United States affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The application of the statute to overseas federal computers and the interpretation of phrases like \"United States Government\" and \"without authorization\" have been subject to debate in the courts. Courts have struggled to define \"without authorization\" and \"exceeds authorized access\" in 18 U.S.C. 1030. Some interpret it as unauthorized use by authorized employees or outsiders with access, while others see it as accessing without any permission or accessing unauthorized information with permission. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) was added in 1986 with the same intent element as credit card fraud laws. The credit card fraud statute defines fraud as the offender being aware of the consequences of their actions and intending for someone to be defrauded. The phrase \"thereby furthers a fraud\" ensures that computer use is central to the criminal scheme. The requirement that the value of converted property exceed $5,000 prevents mere computer trespassing from being prosecuted as fraud. Case law shows the difficulty of prosecuting under paragraph 1030(a)(4), as seen in United States v. Czubinski where the government failed to prove fraud. The government can be defrauded, punishable by imprisonment and fines. Paragraph 1030(a)(4) prohibits unauthorized use of government, bank, or interstate commerce computers for fraud. Conviction requires victim restitution and may lead to confiscation of assets. Victims can seek compensatory damages and injunctive relief under subsection 1030(g). The federal criminal law includes statutes prohibiting theft or fraud of federal property, financial institutions, and property involving interstate or foreign commerce. The wire fraud statute condemns the use of interstate or foreign wire communications to defraud another of money or property, which can include confidential information stored in computers. Credit card fraud is also addressed in Title 18. Section 1029 of Title 18, known as credit card fraud, prohibits the deception of commercial computer systems using an \"access device\" to acquire cash, credit, merchandise, or services. The statute has a jurisdictional base that applies to offenses affecting interstate or foreign commerce. An access device includes various means of account access and the level of intent for the crimes established in this section is the same. Section 1029 establishes three types of crimes related to credit card fraud: misuse of access devices, conduct in anticipation of misuse, and attempts or conspiracies. It includes the use of counterfeit or unauthorized access devices, with criminal liability requiring knowledge and intent to defraud. The offenses under \u00a71029 related to credit card fraud include possession of counterfeit or unauthorized access devices, possession of device-making equipment, offering or selling access device information without authorization, use of modified telecommunications devices, illegal wiretapping equipment, possession of equipment to avoid telecommunications charges, and causing someone to present credit card slips with intent to defraud. Paragraph 1029(b)(1) and (b)(2) outline separate offenses for attempting or conspiring to commit crimes related to credit card fraud. Attempt carries penalties similar to the completed offense, while conspiracy has lesser penalties. The maximum punishment is determined by the underlying violations of \u00a71029, with imprisonment for not more than 10 years for certain offenses. The federal statute outlines penalties for various offenses related to credit card fraud, including unauthorized sale of access devices and possession of counterfeiting equipment. Conspiracy to defraud the United States is also a federal crime, with broad scope and no requirement to show intent to deprive of money or property. The federal statutes cover various forms of fraud, including conspiracy to obstruct government functions through deceitful means and manipulation of federal computers. Other statutes address false statements, major procurement fraud, false claims against the United States, and defrauding financial institutions. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. 1037, criminalizes fraudulent activities related to sending multiple deceptive commercial emails using protected computers. This law broadens federal prosecution capabilities against hackers using email for fraudulent purposes. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 18 U.S.C. 1037, criminalizes fraudulent activities related to sending multiple deceptive commercial emails using protected computers. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to 5 years and fines up to $250,000 for individuals ($500,000 for organizations). Money laundering related to the proceeds of federal crimes is also prohibited under federal statutes. Money laundering involves prohibiting domestic and international laundering of proceeds from specified unlawful activities, using the proceeds to promote further crimes, or depositing over $10,000 of the proceeds. Various offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1030 are considered money laundering predicate offenses, including credit card fraud and wire fraud. Financial transactions for money laundering purposes encompass almost all wealth transfers affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The jurisdictional element for these transactions is characterized as minimal. The government must show minimal jurisdictional element for money laundering offenses, with the transaction intended to further illicit schemes. To convict under \u00a71957, the defendant must engage in a monetary transaction with criminally derived property over $10,000, knowing it's from unlawful activity. The predicate offenses are the same as for \u00a71956, and the transaction must occur in or affect interstate or foreign commerce. Congress enacted subparagraph 1030(a)(7)(A) in 1996 to address computer fraud, specifically targeting extortion through threats or demands related to damaging a protected computer. The law aims to punish those who transmit such communications in interstate or foreign commerce, with penalties for attempted offenses as well. The Hobbs Act and 18 U.S.C. 875(d) do not clearly cover computer operations or encrypted data. In 2008, subparagraphs 1030(a)(7)(B) and (C) were enacted to address situations where criminals threaten to disclose stolen information unless paid. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) requires a threat transmitted in interstate commerce and directed against a protected computer for prosecution. The 2001 amendment to the definition of \"protected computer\" expanded the scope to include computers located outside the United States that affect interstate or foreign commerce. Subparagraph 1030(a)(7)(A) prohibits threats to cause computer \"damage\" and aims to penalize threats directed against computers through interstate or international transmission. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the definition of \"damage\" in the context of threats against computers, covering any interstate or international transmission of threats that impair the integrity or availability of data, programs, systems, or information. This includes interference with normal computer operations, such as denying access, erasing data, slowing down operations, or demanding ransom for encrypted data. Threat statutes provide insight into what constitutes a threat, and even contingent or unintended threats are still considered threats under the law. The level of intent required for a violation of paragraph 1030(a)(7) differs from the level used for the fraud provisions of \u00a71030. Rather than demand that the offense be committed \"knowingly and with an intent to defraud,\" each of the offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(7)(B) and (C) differ from the usual threats, addressing threats to breach the confidentiality of data and threats to fail to undo damage already inflicted if extortionate demands are not met. The offenses under paragraph 1030(a)(7) must be committed \"with the intent to extort,\" leading to potential imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine. Victims can seek damages under subsection 1030(g) for cases involving over $5,000 in damage. Restitution and confiscation of property related to extortion offenses are possible. These offenses are not classified as federal crimes of terrorism. It is a separate crime to attempt or conspire to violate paragraph 1030(a)(7) with penalties similar to those who commit the offense. Circumstances determine if violations of 1030(a)(7) could be prosecuted under the Hobbs Act, which prohibits extortion affecting commerce with a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. Minimal impact on commerce is sufficient for jurisdiction under the Hobbs Act. The Hobbs Act defines extortion as obtaining property through force or fear. Paragraph 1030(a)(7) prohibits extortion involving threats to damage computer systems affecting interstate commerce. Other federal statutes also prohibit threats made with extortionate intent. The Hobbs Act and other federal statutes prohibit communication of threats with extortionate intent, targeting property or money as the objective. The term \"thing of value\" in federal criminal law is broadly interpreted, with debates over what constitutes \"property\" in intangible cases. Financial transactions involving proceeds from computer-related extortion that violate paragraph 1030(a)(7) may support prosecution under money laundering statutes. Violation of paragraph 1030(a)(7) may also lead to RICO prosecution under companion statutes like the Hobbs Act or the Travel Act. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) prohibits the posting of passwords for computer systems, particularly government computers, on electronic bulletin boards. It serves as a lesser included offense to access device proscriptions, allowing for plea bargaining and civil liability enforcement. This provision aims to deter the public posting of access to confidential computer systems without imposing severe penalties unless the misconduct persists. Paragraph 1030(g) addresses misconduct involving fraudulently trafficking computer passwords affecting interstate or foreign commerce. Federal jurisdiction applies when the offense involves government computers or systems used by the United States. The scope of protection under this paragraph for legislative and judicial branch computers is unclear. The intent element in paragraph 1030(a)(6) is similar to fraud offenses, punishable by imprisonment and fines. The general theft/damage sentencing guideline covers violations of paragraph 1030(a)(6). The sentencing guideline U.S.S.G. \u00a72B1.1 covers violations of paragraph 1030(a)(6) (traffic in passwords) similar to fraud offenses. Proceeds and property traceable to the violation are subject to confiscation, and restitution may be ordered upon conviction. Offenders may also face damages or injunctive relief. Victims can sue for losses over $5,000, including lost revenues and costs of damage assessment. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) is a money laundering predicate offense but not a RICO predicate offense. Paragraph 1030(a)(6) is not a RICO predicate offense, but it can still lead to a RICO prosecution if the proceeds are laundered or if it involves violations of access device provisions or wire fraud. Brokering computer passwords alone may not build a criminal enterprise, but combined with other crimes, it could be part of a pattern of criminal activity. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) of federal espionage laws prohibits the disclosure of information detrimental to U.S. national defense, merging elements of espionage and computer abuse. It tracks existing laws banning spying and has been amended to align more closely with other espionage statutes. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) merges elements of espionage and computer abuse by prohibiting the disclosure of classified information related to national defense or foreign relations. This federal law is anchored in protecting the defense and foreign relations of the nation, with jurisdictional ties to interstate or foreign commerce. The state of mind element for a breach of paragraph 1030(a)(1) is higher than other subsection offenses. Offenders must purposefully transmit or retain information that could harm the United States or benefit another country, obtained through unauthorized computer access. Violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years (20 years for subsequent offenses) and/or a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). The general espionage sentencing guideline applies, with a base sentencing level of 30 or 35 for top secret information. Paragraph 1030(a)(1) offenses are federal crimes of terrorism, with a minimum sentencing level of 32 for terrorist purposes. If paragraph 1030(a)(1) is committed for terrorist purposes, the minimum sentencing level is 32 with a criminal history category of VI, resulting in a sentencing range of 17.5 years' imprisonment. The statute of limitations is 8 years, pretrial detention is presumed, and conviction may lead to lifetime supervision. Offenses in conjunction with other crimes can result in sentencing enhancements or additional charges. Proceeds and property used in the offense are subject to confiscation, restitution is required upon conviction, and offenders may face damages or injunctive relief. The penalties for attempting, aiding, or abetting violations of paragraph 1030(a)(7) are the same as for committing the substantive offense. Espionage prosecutions are rare, and there have been no reported cases under paragraph 1030(a)(1). Cases prosecutable under 1030(a)(1) would likely also fall under espionage statutes. The only reported 'espionage' case prosecuted under \u00a7793, not \u00a71030(a)(1), shares common ground with three espionage statutes outlawing gathering and disseminating defense information. Section 793 establishes six distinct offenses related to national defense information. Section 793 and 794 outline penalties for violations related to national defense information, including imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines up to $250,000. Section 794 imposes harsher penalties for offenses involving gathering defense information for a foreign nation or to harm the United States, especially during wartime. Section 798 prohibits dissemination of classified information on communications intelligence and government cryptography, with similar penalties. The economic espionage prohibition, 18 U.S.C. 1831, prohibits stealing, copying, or possessing a trade secret for a foreign entity. Offenders face up to 15 years in prison and fines up to $5,000,000. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits unauthorized access to financial records, government information, and protected computers. Offenders face criminal charges for intentionally accessing computers without authorization.
