    "content": "The Senate's procedures are based on standing rules, orders, precedents, statutes, mandates, committee rules, party conference rules, and informal practices. Reference sources provide information on how these authorities govern parliamentary situations, establishing the framework for Senate business. The report discusses various sources like the Senate Manual, Riddick's Senate Procedure, committee rules, and publications on Senate procedure. It also reviews principles of Senate parliamentary procedure. The report covers Senate's official parliamentary reference sources, including authoritative statements of rules, procedures, and precedents. It also reviews party conference rules and additional publications providing background information on parliamentary authorities. Text boxes offer guidance on accessing these sources, with an emphasis on online access. The report aims to present relevant access points for Senators and congressional staff, without providing an exhaustive list of locations. Two appendixes supplement the information on parliamentary reference sources. The report provides an overview of Senate procedures and the various parliamentary authorities that govern them. It highlights key principles such as the Senate's power to make its own rules, the importance of unanimous consent, and adherence to precedents and informal practices. Official guidance on Senate procedure is available from the Office of the Senate Parliamentarian and CRS staff can assist with clarifying rules and procedures. The Senate's parliamentary procedures are governed by various sources, including standing rules, the Constitution, precedents, statutory provisions, committee rules, party conference rules, procedural agreements, and informal practices. These sources must be considered to understand Senate procedure. For example, Rule XIX states the order of recognition for Senators, with precedence given to leaders and managers. This can impact proceedings on the Senate floor. The Senate's rulemaking authority allows it to determine its procedures through standing rules, amendments, and standing orders. This authority is granted by Article I of the Constitution and includes the power to decide when its rules should not govern. This flexibility is essential for understanding how the Senate conducts its business. The Senate can waive its rules by unanimous consent or suspend them by a two-thirds vote. It can also set aside a rule by majority vote if a point of order is overruled. The presiding officer may not always enforce rules, but a Senator can make a point of order to prevent violations. The Senate can violate its procedures unless a Senator raises a point of order, which the presiding officer rules on. The Senate can appeal the ruling by majority vote, establishing a precedent for future decisions. Some rulemaking statutes require a supermajority vote to overturn the presiding officer's ruling. The Senate's actions are not enforceable on the Senate floor if based on informal practices or party conference rules. These practices and rules do not have the authority of Senate rules and procedures but can impact actions in committees and on the Senate floor. The Senate often operates outside its standing rules through unanimous consent agreements to expedite legislation. UC agreements are carefully crafted by the majority leader in consultation with other Senators and have the same authority as the Senate's standing rules. They can only be altered by unanimous consent and have the effect of changing Senate rules and precedents. These agreements are enforceable on the Senate floor and complement the published precedents of the Senate. Precedents in the Senate, akin to case law, play a crucial role in interpreting the standing rules. Senators use precedents to support arguments, challenge points of order, or appeal rulings. These precedents are established through Senate votes on questions of order or decisions made by the presiding officer. They guide the application of current Senate rules by linking past decisions to present cases. Precedents in the Senate are crucial for interpreting rules. They are established through Senate votes or decisions by the presiding officer. Precedents reflect the judgment of the full Senate and carry varying weights. More recent precedents and those reflecting established patterns hold more weight. All precedents must be evaluated in the historical context of the Senate's rules and practices. The Senate Parliamentarian's Office provides precedents for arguments, including unofficial practices that have evolved over time. These practices, though not enforceable, are often followed, such as respecting \"holds\" by individual Senators and giving the majority leader the ability to make motions. The Senate Manual compiles official parliamentary authorities periodically. The 113th Congress Senate Manual contains various parliamentary authorities, including Standing Rules, Nonstatutory Standing Orders, Rules for Regulation of the Senate Wing, Rules of Procedure for Impeachment Trials, Cleaves' Manual, General Laws, and the Constitution of the United States. Each authority is detailed with section numbers and bold type for easy reference. The Manual also includes a general table of contents and index for navigation. The Senate Manual contains the standing rules of the Senate, which are cited by section number. The rules are considered continuing without the need for re-adoption at the start of each new Congress. Changes to the rules are proposed through Senate resolutions and can be adopted by majority vote. As of the 116th Congress, there were 44 standing rules, with footnotes indicating amendments since 1979. The Senate Manual contains standing rules adopted since 1979, with footnotes citing resolutions for rule changes. Standing orders, with the same authority as rules, are created by resolutions or unanimous consent requests. These orders remain in effect until repealed, compiled in sections 60-139 of the Manual. The Manual includes headings, citations to resolutions, and footnotes for supplementary information on standing orders. The Senate Manual contains a compilation of \"General and Permanent Laws Relating to the U.S. Senate,\" presenting statutory excerpts in their codified version. It includes provisions on Senate administration, operations, and procedural requirements, as well as rulemaking statutes. The Manual also addresses Senate procedure, such as Senators' oaths of office and investigative procedures in Senate committees. The Senate Manual contains statutory excerpts related to Senate administration, operations, and procedural requirements. It outlines the Senate's exclusive powers, such as advice and consent on treaties and executive nominations, and the power to try impeachments. The Manual also includes historical footnotes on the Constitution and amendments, with bold brackets around amended text. Senate Rule XXXIII grants authority to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for making rules and regulations for the Senate side of the Capitol complex. The Senate Manual outlines the Senate's exclusive powers and includes historical footnotes on the Constitution and amendments. Senate Rule XXXIII grants authority to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for making rules and regulations for the Senate side of the Capitol complex, including regulations on floor activity and impeachment proceedings. Cleaves' Manual provides a digest of rules and precedents governing Senate practice in relation to conference committees and reports. The Senate Manual, Cleaves' Manual, and Riddick's Senate Procedure provide rules, precedents, and guidelines for Senate practices, including conference committees and reports. Cleaves' Manual includes excerpts from Thomas Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Practice and sets forth forms for conference reports. The Manual also presents the Constitution with annotations to aid in reference. Riddick's Senate Procedure is a comprehensive reference source covering Senate rules, precedents, and practices. Published in 1992, it covers Senate precedents from 1883 to 1992 and is organized around procedural topics presented in alphabetical order. It includes summaries of general principles, relevant rules, and precedents established in the Senate. Riddick's Senate Procedure, published in 1992, covers Senate rules, precedents, and practices from 1883 to 1992. It organizes topics alphabetically, providing footnotes with citations to precedents and sample floor dialogues. The information includes terminology used by Senators and the presiding officer in various parliamentary situations, as well as established forms used in the Senate. The Senate establishes standing orders by resolution or unanimous consent agreements, usually effective for a Congress or limited period. These standing orders are adopted at the start of each Congress and are not included in the Senate Manual but appear in the Congressional Record. For example, in the 116th Congress, the Senate adopted 11 unanimous consent agreements re-establishing standing orders on various procedural topics. The Senate adopts standing orders through unanimous consent agreements, which serve as parliamentary authorities and override standing rules. These agreements set conditions for floor consideration of measures, such as time limits for debate and voting, and are enforced like standing rules. They are propounded orally and printed in the Congressional Record, with accepted agreements listed in the Senate's daily Calendar of Business. Each standing committee must adopt written rules of procedure by March 1 of the first session of each Congress. Committee rules are crucial in the legislative process, covering procedures like preparing reports and issuing subpoenas. Each committee's rules are published in the Congressional Record and may also be available in committee prints or on their websites. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration compiles all Senate committee rules in a document called Authority and Rules of Senate Committees each Congress. The Senate establishes procedural regulations through simple resolutions or provisions in statutory measures, requiring agreement between both houses and the President. These procedures have the same standing as Senate and House rules and can be changed through a simple resolution of the Senate. The Senate establishes procedural regulations through simple resolutions or statutory measures, including those derived from Legislative Reorganization Acts and the Congressional Budget Act. These rules can be changed through a simple resolution of the Senate. The term rulemaking statute is often used in connection with laws specifying legislative procedures in Congress for considering executive branch actions. Examples include the Congressional Review Act for overturning agency rules and statutes like the Congressional Budget Act for budgetary legislation procedures. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, along with subsequent acts like the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and the Budget Control Act of 2011, define Senate floor procedures for considering the congressional budget resolution. The purpose of the concurrent resolution on the budget is to establish a budget plan for the fiscal year, including supplementary procedural regulations and points of order. Some budget resolutions have established \"pay-as-you-go\" procedures for Senate consideration of legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Procedures in congressional budget resolutions are not compiled in a single source and can be identified by examining adopted resolutions. Senate conference rules, though not adopted by the Senate itself, can impact proceedings. Publications by Senate committees provide valuable information on parliamentary procedure. The Senate's standing rules and precedents can documents like the Electronic Senate Precedents and Compendium of Laws and Rules of the Congressional Budget Process provide valuable information on parliamentary procedure and budget making process in the Senate. The Senate Cloture Rule, prepared by CRS, covers the rule's history and application. The Senate Cloture Rule, issued during the 112th Congress, covers the rule's history and application. It does not include changes made in subsequent Congresses. Another document, Treaties and Other International Agreements, prepared for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, details the Senate's role in treaty consideration. Enactment of a Law provides a summary of the legislative process by former Senate Parliamentarian Robert B. Dove. The Senate Parliamentarian explains Senate floor procedures and the functions of Senate officials. \"How Our Laws Are Made\" summarizes the legislative process, including Senate procedures. Appendix A lists CRS reports on Senate procedure, available on the CRS website. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on Senate procedures, including topics such as budget reconciliation, filibusters, cloture, conference committees, and invoking cloture. These reports offer detailed insights into the legislative process on the Senate floor. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on Senate procedures, accessible through Congress.gov and govinfo.gov, providing valuable insights into legislative processes.
