    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\". The Act, known as the \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007,\" emphasizes the importance of protecting the United States from the threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. It also aims to strengthen compliance with international treaties related to non-proliferation. The Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, IAEA safeguards system, MTCR, AG, NSG, and WA control lists have served US national security interests. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1991 has been beneficial. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, established by the Nunn-Lugar Act and its successor laws, has achieved significant milestones by deactivating nuclear warheads, destroying missiles and launchers, eliminating bombers, and more. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, established by the Nunn-Lugar Act and its successor laws, has achieved significant milestones by eliminating 601 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, destroying 30 strategic nuclear submarines, and sealing 194 nuclear test tunnels or holes. President George W. Bush called for the program's expansion in 2004 to prevent weapons from falling into the wrong hands and continue efforts to secure weapons and materials from the old Soviet WMD arsenal. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the US must utilize all capabilities to prevent catastrophic terrorism using weapons of mass destruction. This includes pursuing a strategy involving multilateral agreements, missile defense, arms control, and holding nations accountable for violations of nonproliferation treaties. The President should have the authority to use Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds to uphold treaties, norms, and standards and reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF RESTRICTIONS. Repeals sections of various acts related to nuclear threat reduction and chemical weapons destruction facilities. SEC. 5. INAPPLICABILITY OF OTHER RESTRICTIONS. Exempts Cooperative Threat Reduction programs from certain restrictions. SEC. 6. COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION PROGRAMS DEFINED.
