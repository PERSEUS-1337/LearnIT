    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with only FERS employees receiving employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which protects spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector retirement plans. Retirement benefits for federal employees under CSRS and FERS are regulated by Title 5 of the United States Code. Similar to private-sector plans governed by ERISA, federal employees must comply with specific rules regarding survivor benefits and beneficiary designations. Both ERISA and Title 5 require written consent from the participant and spouse to waive the survivor annuity. However, there are some differences between the two regulations. Under ERISA, a court can require a plan to start paying benefits to the former spouse when the plan participant reaches retirement age, regardless of whether the participant has retired. In contrast, Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service and is eligible to receive an annuity. ERISA requires written consent from a spouse to name a beneficiary in defined contribution plans, while federal regulations allow more flexibility in the Thrift Savings Plan. Federal regulations allow a participant in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as the plan beneficiary in the event of their death without the knowledge or consent of any person, including their spouse. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of the employee's retirement annuity or survivor annuity. The Office of Personnel Management will only pay benefits specified in the court order. CSRS retirement annuity can be awarded to a former spouse according to a state court decree or property settlement. The Office of Personnel Management will divide a federal employee's retirement annuity as directed by a court order and pay the former spouse's share. This division only occurs after the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for an annuity, and has applied for it. A former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it for the former spouse or a court order must specify it. A CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The survivor annuity for a retired federal worker is calculated based on a reduction formula. The spouse or former spouse is entitled to 55% of the worker's full annuity. There are limitations on the total amount of survivor annuities that can be paid to spouses and former spouses. If a former spouse has been awarded a survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless certain conditions are met. There are exceptions to the termination of a survivor annuity for a former spouse in cases of remarriage before the age of 55. The survivor annuity for a retired federal worker is calculated based on a reduction formula, with the spouse or former spouse entitled to 55% of the worker's full annuity. An employee's election or court order for a survivor annuity can only be modified before retirement or death. If a former spouse waived their right to a survivor annuity, a court order awarding it will not be honored. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a CSRS annuity. State courts can block refunds if a former spouse is awarded a share of the annuity. FERS retirement annuities can be divided between a federal annuitant and former spouse by court decree. OPM will divide a federal employee's retirement annuity as directed by a court order and pay the former spouse's share. This division only occurs after the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for an annuity, and has applied for it. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death. A survivor annuity can be received by the former spouse if elected by the retiree or specified in a court order. FERS allows a federal employee to elect a survivor annuity for a former spouse, with the amount being 50% of the retiree's single-life annuity. The joint and survivor annuity is funded by reducing the retiree's single-life annuity amount by 10%. In return, the worker's spouse or former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity. An employee may provide for no more than one FERS spouse survivor annuity, and the total amount paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity. A survivor annuity terminates upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse before the age of 55, with exceptions for remarriages lasting at least 30 years. If an employee participating in FERS dies after completing at least 18 months of service but fewer than 10 years, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump-sum payment. This benefit may be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a state court order. If the employee dies after completing at least 10 years of service, the surviving spouse or former spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the employee's earned annuity at the time of death. A separating employee forfeits the right to receive a FERS annuity if they choose to receive a refund of contributions to the retirement system. A state court can block this refund if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the employee's FERS retirement annuity. An employee can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Board. Married participants do not have to designate their spouse as the beneficiary of the TSP account, and written consent is required from the spouse for certain financial transactions. The TSP requires spousal consent for certain financial transactions and withdrawals. CSRS participants do not need spousal consent but the spouse will be notified. FERS participants' spouses are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity unless waived. State court orders regarding divorce, alimony, and child support are recognized by the TSP. Former spouses of FERS workers may be eligible for Social Security benefits if married for at least 10 years. If a divorced spouse of a Social Security insured worker remarries, they cannot collect benefits unless the new marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. A divorced spouse can receive widow or widower benefits if married for at least 10 years. Survivor benefits end if the divorced spouse remarries before age 60, unless the later marriage ends. Remarriage does not affect survivor benefits for the deceased worker's children."
