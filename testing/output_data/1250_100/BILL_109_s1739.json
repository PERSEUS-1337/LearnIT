    "content": "SECTION 1. RELEASE OR DETENTION OF A MATERIAL WITNESS. Amendments to Title 18 include Section 3144, which pertains to the release or detention of a material witness in a criminal case before a court of the United States. A judicial officer may order the arrest of a material witness if there is probable cause to believe their testimony is material and they have failed to appear after being served with a summons or subpoena. The requirement of a summons or subpoena may be waived if the judicial officer finds clear and convincing evidence that the person is likely to flee. A warrant for a material witness must contain the witness's name or a description for identification, specify the need for testimony in a criminal case, command the witness's arrest, inform them of their right to counsel, and be signed by a judicial officer. Upon arrest, the warrant for a material witness must be shown to them by the arresting officer. If the officer does not have the warrant at the time of arrest, they must inform the witness of its existence and purpose, and provide it upon request. After executing a warrant, the officer must return it to the judicial officer when the material witness is brought in. An unexecuted warrant can be canceled at the request of the US attorney. A material witness arrested must appear before a judicial officer without delay in the district of arrest or an adjacent district if more convenient. At the initial appearance, a judicial officer must inform a material witness of the warrant against them, their right to counsel, allow them to consult with counsel, and decide whether to release or detain them. If the appearance is in a different district, the witness may be transferred there. Upon appearance before a judicial officer, a material witness arrested under a warrant must be released or detained based on the officer's findings. The witness may be released on personal recognizance or bond unless clear evidence shows they may not appear as required. No material witness may be detained if their testimony can be secured by deposition. If no conditions assure the witness's appearance, they may be detained for up to 5 days or until their testimony is secured. Upon motion, detention of a material witness can be extended for up to 5 days or until testimony is secured. The total detention period cannot exceed 30 days in a criminal case or 10 days in a grand jury proceeding. A motion for the testimony of a material witness must show good cause for why deposition or court appearance was not possible in the previous 5-day period. Factors like the witness's history and challenges to the warrant can be considered for release or detention decisions. Release and detention orders must meet specific requirements. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on the use of material witness warrants, including the number of warrants sought and granted, and the number of witnesses arrested. Material witnesses should be held separately from individuals charged with crimes and under the least restrictive conditions possible. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on the use of material witness warrants, including the number of warrants sought and granted, and the number of witnesses arrested. Rule 46(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is amended to supervise the detention of defendants awaiting trial and material witnesses to eliminate unnecessary detention."
