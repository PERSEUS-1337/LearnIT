    "content": "The Smithsonian Institution (SI) was created by Congress in 1846 to increase and diffuse knowledge among men. It was established through a bequest from English scientist James Smithson. Today, SI is a complex of museums, education, research, and revenue-generating entities primarily located in Washington, DC, with additional facilities across the United States and world. It employs 6,500 staff and 6,300 volunteers, with its museums and zoo visited 29.3 million times in FY 2015. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a unique governmental organization overseen by a board composed of representatives from different branches of government. It manages entities created by Congress and accepts gifts and grants to support its mission of increasing knowledge. SI receives an annual appropriation of approximately $696 million but does not directly implement government programs beyond managing its buildings and properties. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) receives appropriations comprising 60% of its annual expenditures, employs federal and nonfederal staff, and has separate funding streams from grants, gifts, and investments. It reported $484.7 million in trust funds for operational expenses in FY2016. SI is overseen by a Board of Regents authorized by Congress. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) acts as a trustee of the Smithson and other bequests and gifts to create entities furthering its missions. The Regents oversee SI's activities, with day-to-day operations managed by the secretary and staff. The Regents, composed of various officials and citizen Regents, have broad authority to oversee and amend activities. The Chief Justice traditionally leads the Regents as chancellor. The Smithsonian Institution is overseen by the Regents, with the Chief Justice serving as the presiding officer. The executive committee consists of three citizen Regents, with specific appointments for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives. The secretary is responsible for managing SI buildings and property, record-keeping, and overseeing various areas of the organization. David J. Skorton is the current secretary. In 2014, Boris Johnson announced plans for a cultural area in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The Regents authorized SI to work with LLDC for Smithsonian exhibit space in the complex. The terms included a $50 million funding commitment from the UK and exhibit openings in 2021. In June 2015, SI's acting secretary mentioned they were looking into the proposal. In June 2015, SI's acting secretary mentioned that SI was looking into a proposal for a joint gallery space with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The funding model for a permanent SI museum was under consideration, with a focus on collaboration and engaging diverse audiences. It was emphasized that this venture would not be a standalone Smithsonian outpost in London, but a partnership with the V&A to enhance storytelling globally. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) has initiated programs without congressional authorization in the past, using its own funds and perceiving a duty as trustee of the Smithson bequest. SI later sought appropriations from Congress for programs that became permanent. Establishing a museum in London may raise issues as the rationale for domestic facilities may not apply internationally. Congress has authorized SI for domestic facilities despite Smithson's will stating an institution in Washington, DC. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) has activities in Panama and Belize with Congress approval. These locations support research not possible in Washington, DC. SI's activities beyond DC, except for two museums in New York, focus on increasing knowledge without immediate public display. Display mechanisms for SI collections support knowledge diffusion, a key part of SI's mission. The Smithsonian Institution is considering establishing an outpost in London to display collections, potentially without congressional approval. Questions arise about how this fits with the intentions of Smithson's bequest and Congress, and how it may impact future appropriations for overseas and U.S.-based activities. These concerns will likely be evaluated in light of the terms of the Smithson bequest and SI's congressional establishment. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 3169, the Smithsonian Modernization Act of 2015, which aimed to change the number of Regents, establish a standard term for all Regents, and appoint citizen Regents based on lists submitted by congressional leaders. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 3169, the Smithsonian Modernization Act of 2015, to strengthen the Smithsonian's resources through full-time Regents dedicated to oversight and fundraising. The bill aimed to update the governance structure to access private resources and improve oversight. H.R. 3387, the Open and Transparent Smithsonian Act of 2015, sought to make the Smithsonian subject to transparency laws and hold open meetings. On November 16, 2016, H.R. 3387 was reported and placed on the Union calendar on December 12, 2016. Senator John Boozman introduced S. 2057 on September 17, 2015, authorizing additional storage space for Smithsonian collections. The bill allocated funds for FY2016 to FY2019 but no further action was taken. Representative Sam Johnson introduced H.R. 3702 on October 7, 2015, as a companion measure to S. 2057. H.R. 3702, a companion measure to S. 2057, was referred to the Committees on House Administration and Transportation and Infrastructure. On October 8, 2015, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management. No further action was taken. On December 18, 2015, Representative Grace Meng introduced H.R. 4307, the National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture Act, which aimed to establish a new national museum focusing on Asian Pacific American life, art, history, and culture. H.R. 4307 aimed to establish a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture. The Regents would appoint a museum director and designate a site for the museum within 12 months. The bill was referred to multiple committees but no further action was taken. On September 13, 2016, H.R. 6001 was introduced by Representative Xavier Becerra to establish a Smithsonian American Latino Museum in SI's Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall. The bill authorized the Regents to plan and construct the museum, including an underground annex facility, in a manner harmonious with the National Mall. The measure was referred to multiple committees for consideration. On September 13, 2016, Senator Robert Menendez introduced S. 3314, the Smithsonian American Latino Museum Act, as a companion measure to H.R. 6001. The bill was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration but no further action was taken."
