    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which deals with gains from constructive ownership transactions. The new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions. If a taxpayer has gain from such a transaction that would be long-term capital gain, it will be treated as short-term capital gain to the extent it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. Additionally, there will be an interest charge on deferral of gain recognition if gain is treated as short-term capital gain. The new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions. Any amount payable under this paragraph shall be taken into account in computing the amount of any deduction allowable to the taxpayer for interest paid or accrued during such taxable year. Any increase in tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining credits or the amount of the tax imposed by section 55. The term 'financial position' refers to any position related to stock, debt instrument, partnership interest, or investment trust interest. A 'position' includes interests like futures contracts, short sales, or options. Taxpayers are considered to have entered into a constructive ownership transaction if they hold a long position in a notional principal contract, enter into a forward or futures contract, or hold a put and call with substantially equal strike prices on the same property. The term 'financial position' encompasses various interests like futures contracts, short sales, or options related to stock, debt instrument, partnership interest, or investment trust interest. Taxpayers engage in constructive ownership transactions by holding a long position in a notional principal contract, entering into forward or futures contracts, or holding put and call options with equal strike prices on the same property. This section does not apply if all positions in the transaction are marked to market. The term 'forward contract' and 'related person' are defined in specific sections. The 'net underlying long-term capital gain' in constructive ownership transactions is determined based on gains and losses. If the taxpayer elects to mark to market, an exception applies. When a taxpayer elects to apply this subsection, subsections (a) and (b) do not apply. Gain or loss on constructive ownership transactions is recognized as if the financial position was sold at fair market value. Any gain or loss is treated as ordinary income or loss. The taxpayer can elect to apply subsection (g) which treats gain or loss on constructive ownership transactions as ordinary income or loss. This election can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and future taxable years unless revoked. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. The amendments made by this section apply to gain recognized after the enactment of this Act."
