    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are defined by the Department of Defense as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator. They can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, carry a lethal or nonlethal payload, and are not considered to include ballistic or semiballistic vehicles. UAVs are used in military operations and have advantages and disadvantages compared to manned aircraft. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, perform tasks historically done by manned aircraft, offering advantages like eliminating pilot risk and having capabilities not limited by humans. They may be cheaper to procure and operate but have a higher crash risk. UAVs have grown in use due to advancements in technology and a shift away from the preference for manned aviation. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, first included in Jane's All the World's Aircraft in 1920. They were tested during World War I but not used in combat by the United States. It was not until the Vietnam War that UAVs like the AQM-34 Firebee were used for surveillance. The Firebee was modified to deliver payloads and became an armed UAV in 2002. The Israeli Air Force pioneered UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s, which were later integrated into the US UAV inventory. This transitioned UAVs in the US from experimental projects to acquisition programs. One of the UAVs acquired from Israel, Pioneer, provided valuable intelligence during Operation Desert Storm. Following the Gulf War, military officials recognized the potential value of UAVs, with the Air Force's Predator quickly adding new capabilities. The Predator debuted in the Balkans conflict, performing surveillance missions and later being used for armed reconnaissance in Afghanistan. Currently, there are five major UAVs in the U.S. inventory: the Navy and Marine Corps's Pioneer, the Air Force's Global Hawk and Predator, and the Army's Hunter and Shadow UAVs. Investment in unmanned aerial vehicles has been increasing annually, with funding reaching over $1.1 billion in FY2003 and a requested $1.6 billion for FY2006. Congress has played a significant role in UAV development, providing funding and oversight. They have directed the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' UAV programs and required DOD to submit a UAV roadmap. Congress has advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs and expressed confidence in UAV technology, predicting that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft will be unmanned within ten years. In recent years, UAV development has accelerated, expanding missions and applications. The DoD must manage these efforts to be cost-efficient, effective, and interoperable. Congressional oversight is needed to ensure that UAV acquisition plans align with investment goals and strategies. UAVs are no longer just for reconnaissance and surveillance, with potential to take over many manned aircraft missions. The potential replacement of manned aircraft with unmanned aerial platforms raises concerns about personnel issues, recruitment, retention, and the impact on the industrial base. The debate over whether UAVs will replace manned aircraft in the future is ongoing, with implications for defense companies and international competition in the UAV marketplace. In the growing international UAV marketplace, concerns about controlling the spread of UAVs to dangerous groups or countries are being examined by Congress. The diversity of UAV designs and applications is increasing, prompting questions about the development and management of UAV programs. From combat-tested UAVs like Pioneer and Predator to untested ones like the Air Force and Navy's Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, the range in sizes and capabilities varies greatly. The evolution of UAVs is evident in the increasing inventory, with 604 UAVs including 2nd generation derivatives like Predator B and I-Gnat-ER. The acceleration and expansion of UAV programs are highlighted, with various non-traditional vehicles like Snow Goose, Onyx, and Neptune. The inventory growth is significant compared to February 2003, showcasing the development in the UAV industry. The increase in DoD's UAV inventory is largely due to rising demand for UAVs to conduct various missions beyond typical ISR applications. Predator B has strike capability, while Predator As have been modified to carry weapons. The Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) target air defenses. UAV roles now include mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force perimeter protection. DOD's UAV R&D funding has grown due to UAVs being a growth industry and advancements in technology. R&D funding for UAVs in FY2006 is more than double the total procurement funding, indicating continued accelerated acquisition of UAVs in the future. The comparison between manned and unmanned aircraft inventories shows that despite the recent increase in UAV production, manned aircraft still make up 95% of all DoD aircraft. UAVs are seen as complements to manned aircraft rather than replacements. The pace of UAV production is expected to continue or accelerate in the future, with recommendations to introduce UAVs into the force structure quickly. Air Force plans include a significant expansion of UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. Former Air Force Chief of Staff, General John Jumper urged General Atomics to maximize Predator production, raising concerns about the pace of UAV development. Congress has pushed for faster acquisition of UAVs, with goals set for unmanned deep strike aircraft. Some in the 109th Congress have advocated for increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military purposes. Some critics express concerns about the ambitious pace of UAV development, fearing it may impact quality and efficiency. Congressional oversight could become more challenging, potentially leading to cost overruns and design deviations. Representative Curt Weldon warns against prematurely fielding new UAVs without addressing fundamental issues like common communication architecture and operational standards. Some services are purchasing million dollar UAVs using unauthorized funding, while others are leasing UAV services for combat operations. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to a crowded production schedule and aggressive funding strategy, leading to \"immaturity\" of critical technologies. A deceleration in pace and management changes may be necessary to maintain quality and efficiency. Many in Congress support UAV programs but want assurances on taxpayer spending. Section 142 of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act requires approval for new UAV systems procurement. Congressional focus is on DoD's administrative processes and effectiveness in UAV development and acquisition. Congressional scrutiny has increased on DoD's development and acquisition programs. The focus on the Army's Future Combat System has led to scrutiny of the DoD's acquisition process for UAVs. There are concerns about potential duplication of effort and calls for centralization of UAV acquisition authority. Cost issues are also a concern, with some UAVs rivaling manned aircraft in cost. The Global Hawk program, for example, is estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft, with significant development cost overruns. The UAV program has experienced significant cost overruns, with an average unit cost growth of 18 percent per airframe, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy breach. Factors contributing to the cost increase include mission creep, inconsistent management practices, and the addition of multiple sensors to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Originally intended for one primary sensor, the Global Hawk's requirements were changed to carry two or more sensors, driving up the price. Additionally, the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has evolved into a larger, more expensive aircraft with a heavy payload, despite budget cuts of over $1 billion. The DoD has cut over $1 billion from the JUCAS budget and changed management responsibility from DARPA to the Air Force. This may reduce the total number of aircraft procured but increase the cost per aircraft. The frequent changes in DoD's organizations involved in UAV development show the challenges in establishing a comprehensive UAV management system. Management of UAV programs has shifted between military services, a Navy-run JPO, DARO, and back to the services under OSD. Little progress has been made in this area, with Congress expressing serious reservations over the management of UAV programs. The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) was created in 1993 to manage DoD's airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAVs, but was disbanded in 1998 due to criticism and problems. Since then, there has been no single procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts, with oversight authority residing in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (OASD(C3I)). In 2001, the OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force to increase joint coordination of UAV programs operated by the services. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, overseen by the Pentagon's acquisition chief, aims to standardize payload development and promote a common vision for future UAV efforts. Dr. Glenn Lamartin emphasized the task force's role in setting requirements and providing structure. Despite its efforts, Congressional concerns about UAV acquisition management and program duplication persist. Several management mechanisms have been initiated to ensure UAV programs adhere to acquisition standards. In 2003, the U.S. Joint Forces Command led experimentation in UAV interoperability. The DoD created the UAV Interoperability Working Group for joint-service cooperation. The JROC established a UAV Special Studies Group for advisory on UAV issues. In 2005, OSD considered appointing an executive agent for UAV programs, with the Air Force petitioning for the role. In late June 2005, the DoD abandoned the idea of an executive agent for UAV programs in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) addresses major interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence enhances UAV applications through technology examination and coordination with the OIPT. The constant organizational changes have raised concerns about UAV management, indicating a lack of a final development and oversight structure to meet military needs. The recent establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is seen as a step in the right direction to meet military needs. The GAO's testimony in March 2005 criticized the lack of oversight in UAV development, leading to the creation of these management groups by the OSD. The UAV COE is described as a 'one-stop shop' for examining common operating systems and optimizing UAV usage. The establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is a positive step in addressing military needs. Questions may arise regarding the final management authority for UAV development. The 2005 UAS Roadmap provides guidance on future roles, technological progress, and investment needs for UAVs. The GAO called for a strategic plan from the Department of Defense to outline inter-service goals and investment priorities for UAVs. The 2005 UAS Roadmap provides guidance on future UAV development paths and approaches, emphasizing interoperability solutions and technology availability. It does not authorize specific UAS or prioritize requirements but identifies future windows for technology integration. The Roadmap's authority is debated between the DoD and GAO, leading to potential reevaluation by Congress to integrate UAVs effectively into future warfighting. The Roadmap mandates integrating UAVs into future warfighting capabilities for all military services, SOCOM, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Developing a coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating competing UAV investments and balancing cost with capability. Quantifying UAV cost efficiency is complex, with flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost being key measurements. The cost descriptions for UAVs include flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Flyaway cost encompasses prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances for engineering changes and warranties. On the other hand, PAUC is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost highlights the discrepancy in costs. Comparing individual UAV costs can be misleading as they operate as part of a system with various components. The cost of UAVs includes various elements such as flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost. Comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft may require considering the cost of supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Budgeting conventions and the allocation of UAV funding requests can complicate cost monitoring. Establishing a uniform cost comparison mechanism is crucial for Congress to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. The US military is projected to spend over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, far exceeding the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. Funding for UAVs is expected to increase, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System budget breaking $1 billion by FY2011. Despite this increase, UAV spending will remain under 10% of total military aviation spending from FY2006 to FY2011. UAV funding represents only three percent of total military aviation funding. Cost savings touted by UAV advocates may be offset by expenses for ground control stations and training for UAV \"pilots\". The overall cost of UAV systems may not always be less expensive than manned aircraft due to higher attrition and lower reliability rates. UAVs have a higher attrition rate and lower reliability than manned aircraft, leading to higher operation and maintenance costs. However, UAV ground control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, somewhat offsetting the cost disadvantage. Studies have shown that replacing manned aircraft with UCAVs may not result in significant cost savings. The DoD found that development costs for manned and unmanned aircraft were similar, but there were procurement cost savings with UCAVs compared to manned aircraft like the F-16. The DoD faces the challenge of balancing cost and capability between manned and unmanned vehicles. The OSD is concerned about the rising cost of UAVs, including both high-tech and less technologically ambitious ones. Sensors contribute significantly to the cost of UAVs, with some sensor payloads making up a large percentage of the overall cost. The increasing costs are attributed to growing demand and a lack of commercial sensor equivalents. Growing demand for UAV sensors, coupled with a lack of commercial alternatives, leads to limited competition and rising costs. Two approaches to UAV employment are proposed: one advocates for many smaller, interconnected UAVs, while the other suggests fewer, more capable UAVs like the Global Hawk. The Global Hawk, a high altitude surveillance platform, has faced delays and funding cuts since 2003. Issues such as interoperability, reliability, autonomy, and engine systems are key areas for investment in UAVs. Lack of interoperability could lead to a decrease in DoD's interest in UAVs. The DoD's interest in UAVs is at risk due to issues with interoperability, which hinders communication between different components. Improving interoperability is crucial for enhancing situational awareness and effectiveness in missions. The DoD is investing in establishing inter-communication among UAVs to facilitate interoperability. The DoD aims to enhance UAV interoperability by integrating interfaces for situational awareness, payload transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. Despite established frameworks, technology progress has been slow. The House of Representatives passed a bill requiring all tactical UAVs to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for improved communication. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Roadmap aims to field the Common Data Link communication system for all large UAVs to achieve interoperability. The finite bandwidth for military aircraft may hinder UAV expansion, requiring a more robust information transfer system due to increased UAV use in wars. The military lacks sufficient bandwidth for multiple UAV operations, hindering their effectiveness. The Transformation Satellite Communications project aims to provide unlimited data transfer capabilities, but faces challenges due to its high cost. The military is facing bandwidth challenges for UAV operations. The Transformation Satellite Communications project aims to address this issue by potentially deploying between 2015 and 2016. One solution is to operate UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft to reduce reliance on satellites and simplify command and control, addressing pilot manpower and retention concerns. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs to reduce mishap rates. The Defense Science Board highlighted the need for improvements in UAV system design and reliability to match the lower mishap rates of manned aircraft. Investment in reliability upgrades for UAVs is crucial to reduce mishap rates. The Defense Science Board suggests that nominal upgrades and investments could significantly lower mishap rates. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing flight control systems and advanced materials to enhance UAV reliability and survivability. The goal in UAV technology is to reduce operator workload by enabling one operator to control multiple UAVs. This would enhance the autonomy and interoperability of UAVs, potentially allowing one operator to control multiple vehicles. Achieving this would greatly improve UAVs as a force-multiplier on the battlefield, but it would require significant time and investment. Investing in autonomous flight capabilities of UAVs is crucial to reduce operator workload and enable one operator to control multiple UAVs. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle have advanced automate flight capabilities, but their autonomy levels may vary. The OSD uses a scale of one to ten to quantify UAV autonomy, with a level of at least eight needed for maximum use by a single pilot. Achieving this goal would require significant investments in control technologies, as noted in the 2005 UAS Roadmap. The Global Hawk UAV currently has an ACL of 2.5, but plans are in place to increase it to six. The goal is to develop \"see and avoid\" technology to allow for autonomous operation and increase the standard ACL to four. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for autonomous flight capabilities. The Air Force has already tested a Predator upgrade that allows one operator to control up to four UAVs. The OSD's 2005-2030 Unmanned Aviation System Roadmap prioritizes the development of heavy fuel engines for UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout due to lack of commercial demand. The military has expressed a need for heavy fuel burning engines, but industry response has been slow. The military is pushing for heavy fuel engines on UAVs like Predator, Shadow, and Pioneer to improve performance and reduce maintenance costs. However, the initial cost of these engines may burden cheaper UAVs with higher production costs. Developers are facing challenges in designing lightweight engines for smaller UAVs, leading to increased production costs. An alternative being explored is a fuel cell developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which could enhance efficiency and reduce detectability of mid-sized UAVs. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring the project with plans for flight testing in 2010. Questions arise about the DoD's strategy for UAV roles and applications, including whether new missions should be added to existing UAVs or if new UAVs should be developed. Some UAVs are primarily used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. There is a concern about unnecessary duplication in production due to the rapid growth of ISR UAVs. The Services' desire to satisfy their unique operational requirements may hinder collaboration on joint manned aircraft projects. The development of UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions may face challenges due to potential duplication in production. Congress questions the need for new UAV programs when existing ones like the Global Hawk already have similar capabilities. Critics argue that producing multiple UAVs with similar performance capabilities may be unnecessary. Congress may intervene to determine when new UAV programs are justified or duplicative. The debate over the necessity of multiple UAV platforms continues, with critics questioning the need for duplication in production. Proponents argue that the variety of UAVs reflects specific mission needs, including factors like landing/takeoff capabilities, durability, and cost. The role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased in recent years, with the majority now equipped for combat operations. The Predator A and B UAVs are armed with Hellfire missiles and have different munition capabilities. Various UAVs are being evaluated for armament, with the J-UCAS program aiming to create an offensive UAV. Comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft in terms of cost and effectiveness are important for determining when to use UAVs in combat. The cost and payload capacity of the MQ-9 Predator B and F-16 Falcon are compared, showing differences in cost per pound of munitions delivered. The F-16 is noted for its versatility in performing various missions. The F-16 is a versatile combat aircraft that can perform missions the Predator B UAV cannot. Manned aircraft may be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat, while UAVs excel in niche circumstances. UAVs are useful for electronic attack, psychological operations, and delivering medical supplies. They are also being considered for homeland defense and security missions, such as border patrol and coastal surveillance. Congressional support exists for using UAVs like the Predator for border security. Interest is growing in using UAVs for various domestic roles, such as law enforcement surveillance, security roles like following trucks with hazardous cargo, and measuring radiation in the atmosphere. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to serve as a small-package transport for local law enforcement during civil unrest. UAVs may also be used in sparsely populated areas to search for forest fires and in the aftermath of disasters like Hurricane Katrina. Following Hurricane Katrina, there is interest in using UAVs for disaster relief efforts. Countries like South Korea and Japan have utilized UAVs for agricultural purposes. To enhance UAVs' role in homeland security, FAA regulations need to align with UAV flight requirements. The FAA granted the Air Force authorization for national airspace operation in 2003, marking progress in reconciling discrepancies. Upgrading UAV collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for reaching common ground with airspace regulations. The Working Group plans to collaborate with the Department of Defense to ensure safe UAV operations and flight requirements. There is a potential for disagreement in integrating UAVs into national airspace. NASA's decision to cancel funding for Access 5, a program to incorporate UAVs into the airspace system, has raised concerns among UAV advocates. In the future, large UAVs could potentially take on aerial refueling tasks currently done by manned aircraft. The KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft operate far from enemy air defenses and focus on aerial refueling. Current UAVs like the Global Hawk have demonstrated the ability to perform similar missions. Future tasks may include air-to-air combat, with experiments underway to equip UAVs with sensors and weapons. A Predator UAV reportedly engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This marks a significant step towards UAVs potentially being able to perform aerial combat missions. The recent Predator launch of an air-to-air missile is a significant development for UAV advocates. Other options for new roles and applications include manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites. Unmanned blimps are being developed to float at high altitudes for extended periods, offering advantages such as decreased dependency on fuel for border surveillance and other missions. The goal of major UAV manufacturers is to develop an operational system by 2010 for homeland security missions. Space satellites offer benefits but can be cumbersome to task due to competing national priorities. UAVs like Global Hawk are being considered as substitutes for low-orbiting satellite constellations due to high space launch costs. Concerns exist about mass UAV production replacing manned aircraft and degrading pilot skills. The Air Force is working to encourage pilots to fly UAVs and consider it a major mission. They offer incentives such as plum assignments and allowing pilots to maintain their manned flying hours. There were concerns about recruitment and retention as more UAVs were fielded, but the impact on DoD's UAV programs on recruitment is more complex than initially thought. The impact of DoD's UAV programs on recruitment is complex. While the Army faces recruitment challenges, the Air Force and Navy are reducing uniformed personnel. The qualifications to operate UAVs vary among services, with the Air Force requiring pilot-rated officers for Predator and Global Hawk operators. The increased use of UAVs may attract individuals who are unable to fly manned aircraft due to physical limitations. The Air Force believes that flying UAVs, especially armed ones, may appeal to personnel who are interested in flying manned aircraft but want to avoid hardships like deployments. Some Reservists and Guardsmen may find flying UAVs from control stations in the US attractive. Not all UAVs require pilots, with some like the Global Hawk being pre-programmed and autonomous. The Air Force emphasizes the technological sophistication of their UAVs and the need for trained pilots to operate them effectively. Increased use of UAVs could potentially attract more recruits to other specialties if they are seen as effective in missions, especially for infantry positions. Congress faces defense industrial base issues such as foreign dependency, subsidies for competitors, industry consolidation, and promoting competition. The DoD's pursuit of UAVs raises questions about the need for pilot-rated officers and the future of UAV autonomy. The DoD's pursuit of UAVs raises concerns about the impact on the defense industrial base, particularly in relation to funding for manned aircraft programs and the erosion of technical expertise. Some believe that focusing on UAVs could harm the ability to produce world-class combat aircraft, while others argue that the industrial base is evolving towards skills needed for advanced UAVs. There are concerns that concentrating on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies, potentially causing a decline in U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. Some proponents believe that UAVs will not replace manned aircraft soon, but others argue that there is commonality in skills and technologies between the two. Major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive, as UAVs are playing a significant role in warfare. Companies like Boeing are looking towards unmanned bombers and fighters for growth opportunities. Northrop Grumman Corp. has established a new business unit to aggressively pursue UAV business, highlighting the importance of U.S. firms competing for the global UAV market. The global UAV market is projected to grow significantly, with potential for U.S. companies to capture new business opportunities and industrial expertise in UAV technology challenge areas. The global growth of UAVs presents policy concerns regarding proliferation and export controls. UAVs and cruise missiles are difficult to control due to their components being similar to those in civil aviation, making diversion of technology easy. This accessibility raises concerns about potential use by various countries or non-state actors. The use of UAVs by Pakistani soldiers raises concerns about their cost-effective nature as potential weapons. The George W. Bush Administration expressed worries about the military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands, particularly in relation to Iraq's UAV capabilities. Foreign companies gaining access to advanced UAV technologies could further enhance their capabilities. Policymakers may need to consider the potential export of key technologies for UAVs. As international business opportunities grow, Congress may address policy issues regarding UAV proliferation. Concerns include preventing dissemination of critical UAV technologies, balancing military aid to allies with proliferation risks, and revising non-proliferation accords like the MTCR to control UAV spread. Considerations include reducing collateral damage versus enemy acquisition of UAVs and potential industry impacts of tighter controls. This section focuses on the status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense, excluding a comprehensive survey or classification system for different types of UAVs. It specifically discusses small man-portable UAVs with short range and loiter time, which are not weaponized and lack detailed cost documentation. These smaller UAVs are popular with ground forces but may compete with larger UAV programs for congressional attention and funding. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a high-profile UAV with multi-mission capabilities. It operates at medium altitude, with a long endurance and surveillance payload. The Predator has accelerated development schedules and increased procurement funding, leading to the development of related UAVs for various missions. It is roughly half the size of an Air Force F-16 Falcon, with a 48-foot wingspan and the ability to remain on station for 24 hours at a time. The MQ-1 Predator is a high-profile UAV with multi-mission capabilities, operated by the Air Force's Predator fleet from Nevada. It is equipped with surveillance payloads including cameras, a laser designator, and synthetic aperture radar for reconnaissance and target acquisition missions. The Predator can remain on station for 24 hours and has satellite communications for beyond-line-of-sight operations. The MQ-1 Predator, also known as the Predator B, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement. It can carry Hellfire missiles for precision attacks and is controlled by a pilot on the ground using a joystick. The Predator B is an upgraded version of the MQ-1 with improved mission capabilities for medium-to-high altitude, long endurance operations. The Predator B, an upgraded version of the MQ-1, features a longer design, more powerful engine, and increased capabilities. It can reach a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, a speed of 225 knots, and has a range of 2000 nautical miles. The Predator B can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons, making it a versatile UAV for surveillance and armed engagement. Additionally, it can launch a mini-UAV known as \"Silent Eyes\" for target identification. The Predator B-ER, \"Mariner,\" is a hybrid UAV developed by General Atomics for the Navy's BAMS program. It combines features from the Predator B and NASA's Altair UAV, with an 86 ft. wing and increased fuel capacity. The Mariner can fly at altitudes of 50,000 feet for up to 49 hours and is equipped with an exterior-mounted maritime radar. General Atomics aims to compete with Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk for the BAMS contract, with a target flyaway cost of $19 million per vehicle. Additionally, General Atomics is developing the Predator C, a third-generation UAV with a turbo-jet engine. General Atomics is developing a third-generation Predator C UAV with a turbo-jet engine for long endurance, high altitude surveillance missions. The Predator C will have similar payload capacity and flight performance to Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk but will not directly compete with it. The I-Gnat-ER, a medium altitude, long-endurance surveillance platform, is a downsized version of the Predator UAV with similar characteristics but lacks SAR and BLOS capabilities. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles with SATCOM data links, MTS sensor/target designators, and Hellfire missiles. The Predator UAV system includes four air vehicles, a ground control station, and a Predator Primary Satellite Link. The cost for a Predator A system in FY2005 was $18.0 million, while a Predator B system cost $46.8 million. The Air Force has 57 deployable MQ-1 Predators and plans to increase MQ-9 Predator Bs to 46 by FY2011. Both Predators are considered valuable assets for the Air Force. During a Senate Armed Service hearing, Air Force Chief of Staff General John Jumper expressed strong support for the Predator UAVs, stating that General Atomics should build as many Predators as possible. The Air Force has delayed the initial operation capability (IOC) of the Predator B from FY2006 to FY2009 to ensure proper training, support infrastructure, and operation strategies are in place. Congressional appropriators increased funding for Predator R&D and Procurement in FY2005 and FY2006, with Senate Authorizers supporting research on integrating \"Viper Strike\" munitions on the Predator. The Pioneer UAV, developed by Israeli Aircraft Industries, has served the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps for nearly twenty years. It was used during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and has undergone progressive performance upgrades. The Navy ended its use in FY2002, passing assets to the Marine Corps, which plans to use it until 2010 or until a Vertical Take off and Landing UAV is ready. The Pioneer is known for its durability and is unofficially referred to as \"Old Reliable.\" The Pioneer UAV, developed by Israeli Aircraft Industries, is roughly half the size of the Air Force's MQ-1 Predator A UAV. It can reach a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet and has a flight range of 100 nautical miles. The propeller-driven SF-350 piston engine keeps the UAV aloft for up to five hours. The mission of the Pioneer is to provide real-time intelligence and reconnaissance capability to field commanders, with a 75 lb payload consisting of a combined E-O/IR camera. Other payloads include a meteorological sensor and a mine detection sensor. The Navy had planned to retire the Pioneer UAV in 2004 and replace it with the VTUAV, but the program was discontinued. The Marine Corps now operates the Pioneer UAVs and plans to keep them flying for another 10 years. Current procurement funds focus on post-production support, with recent funding for upgrade kits only. The Pioneer system, including five vehicles, cost $17.2 million in FY2004. The Marine Corps currently operates 35 Pioneer UAVs at various locations. Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk is now the largest and most expensive UAV in operation. The RQ-4 Global Hawk is the largest and most expensive UAV currently in operation for the Department of Defense. It has diverse surveillance capabilities that rival manned spy planes, flying at high altitudes for long durations. Despite its success in demonstrations and battlefield surveillance, concerns over costs and program controls have slowed its development progress. The Global Hawk is 44 feet long, weighs 26,750 lbs, and can fly at 65,000 feet for up to 35 hours, covering a distance of 5,400 nautical miles. The RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV can fly for up to 35 hours, covering 5,400 nautical miles. It loiters at 60,000 feet, monitoring a large area for 24 hours before returning. The RQ-4B model has a larger airframe, enabling it to carry an extra 1000 lbs of surveillance payload. The UAV provides persistent high-quality imagery valuable for surveillance and interdiction operations. The RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV has a 2,000-lb sensor suite with SAR, E-O camera, and IR sensor. Northrop Grumman expanded the payload to include multi-intelligence capabilities, such as SIGINT and ELINT sensors. The RQ-4B model has an open-system architecture for multiple payloads and will add MP-RTIP for enhanced radar capabilities. Future plans include hyper-spectral sensors and laser communications for increased imagery precision and information transfer. The goal is to create a UAV that works with space-based sensors to prevent tactical surprises. The Global Hawk UAV, developed by Northrop Grumman, has diverse surveillance capabilities and is authorized to fly in U.S. civilian airspace. It is considered for anti-drug smuggling and Coast Guard operations. The program is expected to reach initial operational capability in 2006 with a total of 51 vehicles planned for acquisition by the Air Force. The program has faced cost overruns, with the current unit cost at $128.7 million. The Global Hawk UAV program has faced cost overruns, with a Government Accountability Office report recommending a delay in future purchases until a development strategy is implemented. Concerns over rising costs and Air Force mismanagement have sparked debate in Congress and the Pentagon. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill criticized the Air Force for not using funds for a counter-drug surveillance program, leading to a recommended $18 million cut in R&D funding for the Global Hawk. The final appropriation bill cut the R&D request for the Global Hawk by six million dollars in response to concerns over rising costs. The House Appropriations Committee also reduced the president's budget request for advanced procurement and current year procurement. Despite criticism, the Air Force's procurement budget request was fully funded for FY2005. In December 2004, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions emphasized the need to control costs, stating that UAVs should not cost as much as manned aircraft. In early 2005, the Air Force planned to restructure the Global Hawk program to achieve Initial Operational Capability by the end of the year. The House Appropriations Committee cut the President's FY2006 procurement request by $110 million, increased Global Hawk R&D by $21 million, and awaits final appropriations from the Senate. The Army's Hunter program has faced turbulence, with plans to acquire 52 systems canceled in 1996. The Army acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs through low-rate production in FY2004 and FY2005. The MQ-5B Hunter II was acquired by the Army in FY2004 and FY2005. It has longer endurance, can be outfitted with anti-tank munitions, and is operated by various military intelligence battalions. The RQ-5A can fly at altitudes up to 15,000 feet, reach speeds of 106 knots, and has an operating radius of 144 nautical miles. The MQ-5B has an elongated wingspan, a more powerful engine, and can stay airborne for three extra hours. The Army has used the Hunter system for surveillance and reconnaissance missions, but is exploring weaponization for tactical operations and border surveillance. The Hunter UAV, used for surveillance and reconnaissance by the Army, is being upgraded with new sensor technology and precision guided munitions like the Viper Strike. The Army has halted production on the RQ-5 Hunter and now uses the I-Gnat-ER to fill service gaps. All 32 Hunter UAVs are still operational as of February 2005, receiving upgrades and modifications periodically. In 2005, all 32 Hunter UAVs are still operational and receive upgrades. The Hunter system includes eight aircraft, ground control systems, and support devices. The final year of Hunter procurement in FY2004 cost $26.5 million. The Army awarded General Atomic's Warrior UAV the contract for the ER-MP UAV program over the Hunter II in August 2005. Despite this loss, Northrop Grumman plans to market the Hunter II to other services. The RQ-7 Shadow was selected by the Army for its TUAV program after a two-decade search for a suitable system. The RQ-7 Shadow 200, built by AAI Corporation, is a low-cost UAV with a range of 68 nautical miles and a flight duration of five hours. It is catapulted from a rail-launcher and has automatic takeoff and landing capabilities. The upgraded RQ-7B Shadow has a larger wingspan and fuel capacity for extended flight endurance. The Shadow provides real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level, with potential missions including medical resupply. The Army is considering expanding the RQ-7 Shadow's missions to include medical resupply, delivering crucial items like blood and vaccines via parachute. The UAV is equipped with surveillance capabilities using an E-O/IR sensor turret for day or night video relayed in real-time. The program maintains an inventory of 100 Shadow UAVs at various military bases and plans to outfit them with Tactical Common Data Link for networking purposes. The Army's RQ-7 Shadow funding reached $16.4 million in FY2005, with plans to use it as an interim Class III TUAV for future combat systems. In FY2005, eight TUAV systems were procured, with $26 million requested in FY2006 for retrofitting upgrades. Total RDT&E requests were $53.6 million in FY2005 and $139.6 million in FY2006. The Pentagon developed UAVs for combat missions in the mid-1990s, resulting in separate UCAV programs for the Air Force and Navy. In June 2003, the Pentagon merged separate UCAV programs for the Air Force and Navy to establish the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) project under DARPA. The objective was to create a flexible offensive network. DARPA was ordered to transfer J-UCAS resources to the Air Force in December 2004. The program will maintain a competitive environment between Boeing and Northrop Grumman's vehicles. J-UCAS consists of two variants, including the X-45C with a length of 39 feet and a wingspan of 49 feet, evolving from previous evaluation vehicles. The X-45C, powered by General Electric's GE F404-102D turbojet engine, can reach speeds of 450 knots and altitudes of 40,000 feet. It has a range of 1,200 nautical miles and can stay aloft for up to seven hours. Boeing designed the X-45C with a stealthy arrowhead shape similar to the B-2 Spirit Bomber. Northrop Grumman's X-47B, a competitor to the X-45C, has a longer wingspan of 62 feet and can endure nine hours with a range of 1,600 nautical miles. The X-47B features folding wing-tips for storage on aircraft carriers. The X-45C and X-47B are designed for combat missions with automated flight capabilities. The Air Force's X-45C focuses on suppression of enemy air defenses and electronic attack warfare, while the Navy's X-47B is for armed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Both aircraft have internal weapons bays and can carry guided weapons like the GBU-31 JDAM. They also feature SARs, ESM sensor suites, GMTI, and the X-47B includes an E-O/IR camera in its payload. The UCAV programs, including the X-45C and X-47B, have faced changes in administration and organization, impacting development pace. DARPA initially oversaw the J-UCAS program for interoperability, but control shifted to the Air Force, causing management fluctuations. The program utilizes spiral development, with current inventory including X-45A and X-47A air vehicles. The J-UCAS/UCAV program has spent over $1.45 billion on RDT&E funding, making it one of the most expensive UAV ventures by DoD. The FireScout, initially designed for the Navy, was revived by the Army in 2003 as the interim Class IV UAV. Recent efforts have explored arming the Fire Scout and adding new mission capabilities. The Fire Scout, based on a commercial helicopter design, features advanced rotor design to reduce acoustic signature. It can stay aloft for up to 9.5 hours with a basic payload, but endurance decreases to six hours with full sensor payload. The vehicle has autonomous flight capabilities and surveillance payload includes a laser designator, IR camera, and multi-color EO camera. Northrop Grumman aims to expand communication capabilities to include wideband data relay and satellite communications. The renewed interest in Fire Scout includes arming the UAV and adding new mission capabilities. The Fire Scout UAV, based on a commercial helicopter design, is being armed for strike missions with weapons like rockets and anti-tank missiles. The program is in the developmental testing phase with plans for future missions including border patrol, search and rescue, and submarine spotting. The Army and Navy anticipate a future inventory of 192 vehicles, with full-rate production expected by 2008. The Fire Scout is intended for use in the Army's Future Combat System program and by the Navy to support the Littoral Combat Ship class. Funding for the Fire Scout comes from various Navy and Army programs. The Coast Guard selected Bell Helicopter Textron's TR911D Eagle Eye UAV for its Deepwater Modernization program. The $3 million Eagle Eye can take off vertically like a helicopter and fly like a plane, with an operational radius of 300 miles. It will enhance surveillance capabilities for drug smugglers, refugees, and ships in distress. The Marine Corps is interested in using the Eagle Eye as a replacement for the RQ-2 Pioneer. Lockheed Martin's Force Protection Aerial Surveillance System (FPASS) monitors airbases in Iraq as part of the Air Force's defense system. Lockheed Martin's FPASS, known as the Desert Hawk, monitors airbases in Iraq and Afghanistan to prevent enemy incursions. The UAV was developed in 1999 for situational awareness through area surveillance and patrols. It is launched by a slingshot device, flies preprogrammed paths for up to an hour, and carries a camera. The total inventory for the Air Force is 126 vehicles, with each system costing approximately $300,000. AeroVironment's Dragon Eye UAV provides Marines with reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition capabilities. It features autonomous GPS navigation, two cameras ports, and an operational endurance of 45 minutes. The Marine Corps awarded a contract for approximately 300 systems of full-rate-production Dragon Eyes, with a unit cost of $154,000 per system. The Pointer UAV, developed by AeroVironment, is currently in service in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. It has a flight endurance of two hours, weighs 8.5 lbs, and features a 9-foot wingspan. The Air Force and Special Operations Command own 50 Pointer systems and plan to purchase an additional 50 systems. AeroVironment is developing the Pointer's successor, the Puma, with an expected endurance of four hours. The Raven UAV, developed by AeroVironment, is a smaller and lighter version of the Pointer. It is hand-launched and powered by an electric battery, with the ability to carry either an IR or E-O camera for real-time image transmission to ground operators. The Raven is used for reconnaissance, sniper spotting, and surveillance scouting by Army and SOCOM personnel.
