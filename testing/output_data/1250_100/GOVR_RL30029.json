    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement around 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming predominant in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are found in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, with origins possibly in the Nile valley. The Bantu people in Africa became skilled in iron smelting by 500 BC, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. European explorers in the 15th century found African farmers growing a variety of crops, including those from the Indian Ocean region and southeast Asia. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, adopting New World crops like maize and peanuts. Large towns and cities did not develop in pre-colonial Africa due to the prevalence of diseases that had evolved with homo sapiens on the continent. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent, with African loyalties embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships for protection. Broadly similar languages and cultural practices were observed across wide areas in Africa. African kingdoms developed through powerful chiefs consolidating authority via conquest and alliances. Great artistic achievements characterized these kingdoms, such as bronze castings in Benin and Congolese masks. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441, with 10-13 million people taken from Africa over 400 years, mostly to Brazil. The Atlantic slave trade peaked in the eighteenth century, with most slaves taken to Brazil and the Caribbean. The British parliament voted to end the trade in 1807, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. Despite efforts to stop the trade, slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. The U.S. banned participation in the slave trade in 1807 and stationed Navy ships off the African coast to halt it with limited success. The Atlantic slave trade conducted by European traders on the West African coast involved purchasing slaves in exchange for goods like guns, alcohol, and cloth. Slavery in Africa was common, with captured individuals often absorbed into families or local armies. The effects of the slave trade on African societies led to turmoil and outbreaks of war, fueled by the exchange of guns for slaves. Scholars debate the impact on politics and economies, but the era was marked by instability in West Africa. The slave trade in Africa fueled instability, with the quest for European arms driving warring parties to seek new captives. This weakened Africa, making it unprepared for direct European colonization. By 1870, European powers were expected to stay on the coast, but indigenous political entities were consolidating power. For example, the kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa had a strong central government, advanced infrastructure, and a national language, while Buganda in East Africa was a naval power with a powerful king and growing trade. In the 19th century, secondary empires relying on European military technology were emerging in Africa, promoting the spread of Islam. Holy wars led to the creation of a vast West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto. In East Africa, Zanzibar sultans extended their power, while Egypt expanded control in northeastern Africa. The Boers in southern Africa practiced a conservative form of Christianity. In the 19th century, the Boers, descendants of Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, established a secondary empire in Africa by defeating the Zulu and establishing farms in grasslands areas. The European scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities, concluding in 1920 with British forces ending resistance in Somalia. Sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control by then. The European scramble for Africa was made possible by advances in medicine and military technology, giving them advantages over African forces. Many Africans chose not to resist colonial invasion due to Europe's military superiority. Ethiopia thwarted Italian ambitions in 1896 but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Italy invaded Ethiopia again in 1935 but was driven out by British troops in 1941-1942. European leaders were initially hesitant to colonize Africa due to doubts about financial gains balancing the cost. However, imperialists, nationalists, and business interests in Britain, France, and Germany pushed for expansion. Diamonds and gold discoveries in South Africa, along with agricultural potential, also drove colonial powers to seize territory in Africa. At the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885, King Leopold II of Belgium successfully gained recognition for his International Association of the Congo (IAC), which controlled Congo and was described as his \"one-man enterprise.\" Leopold's plans were supported by U.S. President Chester Arthur and a Senate resolution. The conference also set rules for future colonization in Africa. The Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885 set rules for future colonization in Africa, limiting colonization to the strongest powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal secured territories in Angola and Mozambique, while the United States assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves in Liberia in 1820. The settlers declared independence in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples. The Americo-Liberians used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples in Liberia in 1847, similar to European colonizers. This led to violent disintegration in the late twentieth century, with indigenous soldiers killing President William Tolbert in 1980. The effects of colonialism in Africa are debated, but Leopold's rule in Congo had clearly negative consequences, including forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool. The colonial era in Africa led to infrastructure development, improved public health, and some education opportunities. Christian missions promoted literacy and education, leading to the rise of African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and Nnamdi Azikiwe. European investment also played a role in Africa's development. European investment in Africa was limited during the colonial era, with colonial governments heavily involved in the economy. This led to the persistence of statist systems after independence, hindering the development of market economies. Colonial economic policies made Africa dependent on exporting primary products for manufactured goods, contributing to economic challenges. Colonial governments did not prioritize democracy, viewing the colonial state as an authoritarian control apparatus. During the colonial era, African political participation was limited, with colonial regimes often imprisoning critics. Britain and France worked closely with local chiefs to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation with traditional authorities contributed to corruption and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Colonial practices intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. During the colonial era, Europeans encouraged Africans to view the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" ruling indirectly through \"tribal chiefs.\" This led to the strengthening of tribal loyalties, which now fuel much of Africa's violent politics. The colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, separating linked cultures and hindering transport between African countries. The end of colonialism in Africa was hastened by World War II, weakening Britain and France. The war emphasized democracy and resistance to aggression, resonating with Africa's nationalists. The United States and Britain affirmed the right of all peoples to choose their form of government in the 1941 Atlantic Charter. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. African nationalists, influenced by European and American movements, began organizing opposition to colonial regimes. British policymakers saw African independence as inevitable but distant, while France pursued assimilation policies in its colonies. In the 1950s, African nationalist sentiments were rising, leading to independence movements in British colonies like Ghana and Nigeria, as well as French colonies. Guinea's vote for independence in 1958 shocked President Charles de Gaulle, prompting France to cut ties with its colonies. Ghana gained independence in 1957, followed by Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya in the early 1960s. In response to growing demands for independence, 14 countries in French-held Africa gained independence in 1960. Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960. In Southern Africa, independence was delayed due to white opposition, leading to armed struggles for freedom. Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, facing UN sanctions and civil war before becoming Zimbabwe in 1980. Angola and Mozambique gained independence in 1975 after Portuguese dictator Salazar was ousted. Namibia also saw armed struggle for independence. In South Africa, white minority rule under apartheid faced increasing resistance in the late 1960s. The National Party imposed racial segregation in 1948, leading to protests and violent resistance in the 1970s. By the 1980s, international isolation and internal pressure forced the government to reconsider defending apartheid. In the late 1960s, white minority rule in South Africa faced resistance, leading to secret discussions with the ANC. Nelson Mandela was freed in 1990, and constitutional negotiations concluded in 1993. Universal-suffrage elections were held in 1994, with Mandela becoming President. In the early 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with the departure of colonial governments and the rise of a new African elite. GNP per capita was rising, and the Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote solidarity and development efforts. In the early years of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), member states pledged to promote African solidarity and improve living standards while respecting non-interference and territorial integrity. However, challenges arose with civil wars in the former Belgian Congo and Nigeria, coups in Togo and Ghana, and ethnic tensions leading to a civil war in Nigeria. Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth declined significantly in the 1970s and 1980s, with many countries under authoritarian regimes. The post-independence era in Africa was marked by civil wars, authoritarian regimes, and challenges stemming from the impact of the colonial era. The continent faced population growth and economic struggles, exacerbated by factors such as drought and the legacy of colonial rule. The Cold War also played a role in shaping Africa's post-independence challenges. During the Cold War, Africa saw a significant increase in arms influx, with the Soviet Union supplying Marxist regimes while the US supported anti-Soviet authoritarian governments. This competition strengthened undemocratic governments and fueled corruption. French policy in Africa aimed to maintain influence and great power status through a \"special relationship\" with former colonies' elites. France cultivated a \"special relationship\" with former colonies' elites, providing military and economic assistance and promising intervention to protect friendly regimes. French businesses gained privileged access to trade opportunities. Critics argued that French policy perpetuated corrupt regimes, while defenders claimed it contributed to stability and development. France began reducing its commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party's election win in 1997. As the Cold War ended, scholars focused on African state weaknesses, blaming corruption, personal ambitions of leaders, and ethnic favoritism for hindering development. The concept of the \"failed state\" gained traction amid media coverage of famine and conflict. Despite some positive developments in the early 1990s, economic difficulties persisted with GDP growth lower than the population growth rate. Hopes for a better future arose with the end of authoritarian rule in Africa. With the end of the Cold War, Africa's authoritarian rulers could no longer manipulate superpowers for power. South Africa's changes averted a violent revolution, paving the way for economic growth in the region. Some African countries saw GDP growth rates exceeding population growth, with political reforms and democratization efforts underway. Multiple interests in civil society were represented, including human rights organizations and political parties. In the 1990s, African countries saw the emergence of multiple political parties and free elections, leading to favorable reactions from analysts. However, disappointment arose as some authoritarian leaders manipulated the electoral process to create \"pseudo-democracies.\" This manipulation was seen in countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon, where leaders liberalized politically under pressure but repressed opposition to hold onto power. In 1998, Richard Joseph highlighted that Africa's democratic opening led to \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but stifled opposition. Recent events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were discouraging for democratization advocates due to political instability and violence. The AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa continued to worsen in December 2000. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic is escalating, with 25.3 million infected individuals, accounting for over 70% of global cases. Uganda and Senegal have seen success in prevention efforts, but the overall infection rate in Africa is 8.8%, much higher than the global rate of 1.1%. Mortality is increasing, with an estimated 17 million deaths already. The region is also plagued by armed conflicts, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has faced upheavals and civil wars since 1996-1997, leading to development setbacks and refugee crises in neighboring countries. Several countries have troops in Congo for various reasons, causing fears of wider war. Armed conflicts are also occurring in Angola, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and other countries. Africa's economic performance has been disappointing, with low GDP growth rates and population increases, leaving the region economically stagnant. South Africa's economy has also shown slow growth, contributing to the region's marginalization in the global economy. \"Afro-pessimists\" predict dim political and economic prospects for the continent in the coming years. The U.S. National Intelligence Council's study in 2000 predicted Africa's increasing international marginalization in 2015 due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Some experts reject this Afro-pessimistic view, arguing it stems from stereotypes and media focus on violence. They believe in a new reality where African governments are becoming more accountable to citizens. The International Monetary Fund acknowledges two decades of economic stagnation in Africa but sees seeds of an economic renaissance due to policy reforms. President Thabo Mbeki and others believe in an African Renaissance, citing progress in reconciliation and democratization in the 1990s. Optimism prevails despite setbacks. The optimistic view on democratization in Africa highlights successful transitions in South Africa and Nigeria, with widespread elections in the region. Despite economic disappointments, countries like Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda show promising GDP growth rates. Optimists believe that with continued reforms and international support, further democratization is possible in the future. Optimists believe that with improved governance and international support, many countries in Africa could enhance opportunities and quality of life. Debt relief and support for poverty reduction programs play a crucial role. Africa's natural resources and the Clinton Administration's Afro-optimist tone also contribute to a brighter future for the continent. President Clinton's visit to Africa in 1998 emphasized the potential for an African Renaissance. President Clinton visited several African countries, praising their growing economies and democratic progress. He highlighted Nigeria's democratic transition and cooperation with the U.S. in combating crime and promoting peace. The administration emphasized Africa's potential as a trading partner, especially in oil imports, projecting it to surpass the Persian Gulf as a supplier within a decade. They supported a congressional trade and investment initiative for Africa. The Administration endorsed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, passed in 2000, and highlighted various interests in Africa including preventing weapons proliferation and combating drug trade and terrorism. They launched initiatives like the Leland Initiative for Internet access and the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative to address food insecurity. Additionally, they launched the LIFE Initiative to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and globally, involving various U.S. agencies. The Administration boosted Africa-related capabilities through various departments and initiatives, including the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and a \"train and equip\" program for Nigerian battalions. They also played a role as mediators in African conflicts, aiming to strengthen peacekeeping capabilities in the region. The Clinton Administration played a role as mediators in African conflicts, with the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea being a notable success. However, other conflicts in Africa frustrated policymakers as they hindered efforts for economic growth and political reform. Trade results during the Clinton years showed mixed growth rates, with imports and exports to Africa growing at slower rates compared to overall U.S. trade. Most trade was concentrated with a few countries, particularly oil producers and South Africa. U.S. investment in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in the petroleum sector, was relatively low compared to total foreign direct investment. Sub-Saharan Africa gained importance in U.S. foreign policy in 1958 with the creation of a Bureau of African Affairs. Controversies have arisen over the years regarding U.S. involvement in African issues such as apartheid, development, and Soviet/Cuban influence. The Eisenhower Administration faced its first African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion, leading to support for a U.N. peacekeeping force. During the Kennedy Administration, the U.S. supported African nationalists and approved funding for a dam in Ghana. The United States also backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa in 1963. In the Johnson Administration, covert aid was provided to suppress rebellions in Congo (Zaire), with concerns over deeper military involvement. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with U.S. backing. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, Africa policy shifted to southern Africa with a focus on Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing aggressive policies in Africa. President Jimmy Carter's Administration emphasized human rights, pushing for majority rule in Zimbabwe and independence for Namibia while criticizing apartheid in South Africa. Cold War considerations continued to influence U.S. policy towards Africa during this period. During the Carter Administration, Cold War considerations influenced U.S. policy towards Africa. The Administration faced pressure to respond to Soviet and Cuban gains in sub-Saharan Africa. Ties were forged with Somalia in response to the emergence of a pro-Soviet regime in Ethiopia. The Ogaden War occurred when Somalia invaded a province claimed by Ethiopia, leading to Cuban involvement. The Carter Administration opposed mandatory sanctions against South Africa due to Cold War concerns. Cuban troops were also assisting the Marxist regime in Angola. During the Reagan Administration, there was a concern about Cuban involvement in Angola, leading to support for covert aid to UNITA. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. The George H.W. Bush Administration focused on the Horn of Africa, with attention on rebel forces in Ethiopia. In 1986, Congress enacted sanctions against South Africa, despite President Reagan's veto. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, attention shifted to the Horn of Africa. Rebel forces in Ethiopia were on the brink of overthrowing the regime in 1991, leading to a peaceful transition facilitated by Bush Administration diplomats. In Somalia, clan violence, drought, and famine created a humanitarian crisis by 1992, prompting a multinational humanitarian intervention by U.S. troops. The administration also advocated for reforms in Africa, promoting democracy and economic liberalization. In 2000, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was enacted to boost U.S. trade and investment in Africa. In 1990, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) to protect aid levels in Africa post-Cold War. In 1993, the South African Democratic Transition Support Act committed the US to supporting democracy in South Africa. In 1994, the African Conflict Resolution Act authorized US assistance for peaceful resolution of African conflicts. In 1998, the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act was enacted to promote African food security. In 2000, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act authorized $300 million for HIV/AIDS efforts worldwide. In 1985, Congress passed emergency funding for African famine relief following media coverage of famine in Ethiopia and Sudan. The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 set policy objectives for the United States in South Africa and imposed sanctions. The Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act of 1992 promoted democracy in the region. The Clark Amendment of 1976 prohibited aid for military operations in Angola, sponsored by Senator Dick Clark. The Byrd Amendment of 1971 exempted the US from UN sanctions on Rhodesia for critical materials imports. In 1992, various books on Africa were published, including works by Gordon, Miller, and Wolpe, Hochschild, Herbst, Joseph, Pakenham, Reader, and Schraeder. Additionally, there are continuously updated issue briefs on U.S. foreign assistance in Africa, AIDS in Africa, Congo, Nigeria, and Sudan. The continuously updated CRS Issue Brief IB98043 by Theodros Dagne focuses on Sudan's humanitarian crisis, peace talks, terrorism, and U.S. policy."
