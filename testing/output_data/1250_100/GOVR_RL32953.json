    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC, calling for reducing greenhouse gases. Despite various proposed actions, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions, focusing instead on voluntary initiatives to curb greenhouse gas growth. In the 2002 UNFCCC report, only six regulatory programs aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals also led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress focused on improving monitoring of emissions, implementing market-oriented reduction programs, and enacting energy programs with additional benefits. The report focuses on comparing two proposals from Senators McCain and Lieberman in the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The proposals aim to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through market-based mechanisms and encourage innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies. S. 1151, debated in 2003 and 2005, aimed for mandatory economy-wide emission reductions through market-based strategies, international trading systems, and carbon sequestration programs. The bill excluded residential and agricultural sources and facilities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. Senator Bingaman proposed a draft amendment based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's report, calling for a tradeable permit program to limit greenhouse gases. The Climate and Economy Insurance Act of 2005 would mandate an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity from 2010 to 2019. The draft amendment proposed a 2.4% annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP from 2010 to 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually thereafter. It includes a cost-limiting safety valve allowing entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity rather than placing an absolute cap on emissions like S. 1151. The draft amendment proposes a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity through annual reductions tied to economic growth. It includes a cost-limiting safety valve for entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The amendment differs from S. 1151 in various aspects such as covered entities, primary agency responsibility, and allowance price limitations. The draft amendment proposes annual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions intensity tied to economic growth, with a cost-limiting safety valve for entities. It differs from S. 1151 in covered entities, primary agency responsibility, and allowance price limitations. Emission reduction estimates for both options involve uncertainty, with S. 1151 projected to achieve a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010, while the draft amendment is estimated to result in a 2.5% reduction. Longer-term reductions were not estimated due to inherent uncertainty.

Emission reduction estimates for both options involve uncertainty, with S. 1151 projected to achieve a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010, while the draft amendment is estimated to result in a 2.5% reduction. In the longer term, emissions could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment than under S. 1151. Amendment 2028, the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003, is similar to S. 1151 but with uncertainties in emission reductions due to varying covered entities. Estimates are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements. The primary source of uncertainty for S. 1151 is the number of covered entities, with estimates ranging from 75% to 85%. Higher coverage means more reductions and certainty, while lower coverage results in lower compliance costs. The draft amendment for Amendment 2028 has uncertainties regarding emission reductions, with future baseline calculations based on GDP growth and carbon intensity improvements. Estimates for economic growth range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case at 3.1%. Carbon intensity improvement projections are also uncertain, with estimates varying. The draft amendment for Amendment 2028 has uncertainties regarding emission reductions, with future baseline calculations based on GDP growth and carbon intensity improvements. Estimates for economic growth range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case at 3.1%. Carbon intensity improvement projections are also uncertain, with estimates varying. The targeted 2009 carbon intensity is in the range of 159MMTCE/M$GDP, but current intensity levels are higher than projected. The draft amendment raises questions about its coverage, with potential entities not covered. The safety valve for emissions reductions is also uncertain, with differing projections on when it would be triggered. The projected cost under S. 1151 is uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. Economic growth would require offsetting increased emissions to maintain the cap, potentially leading to higher costs. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are affected by uncertainties in energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and international credits. Studies show potential permit prices in 2010 ranging from $9 to $15 per ton. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive compared to S. 1151, as it requires fewer emission reductions and incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target. This allows for some increase in future emissions if economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity. The projected cost of the draft amendment is influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures such as energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. The draft amendment focuses on cost-effective carbon sequestration and non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, with a safety valve limiting costs to $7 a ton. It does not allow for international trading, unlike S. 1151. The estimated permit price ranges from $4.8 to $5.9 per ton in 2001 dollars, providing a firm limit on potential costs. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions focus on setting acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. A tradeable permit program sets allowable emissions while letting the marketplace determine permit values. A carbon tax sets the maximum cost per ton of CO2 reduction, with the marketplace determining the actual reduction. The preference for a tradeable permit system or safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. A safety valve may be appropriate for controlling CO2 emissions, as it effectively caps the cost of control for affected entities. This approach allows for cost efficiency by allowing emitters to spend money on controlling emissions up to the safety valve level. However, the precise level of CO2 reduction achieved is less certain with a safety valve, making it similar to a contingent carbon tax. The decision between a tradeable permit program and a safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. The draft amendment leans towards a price-based approach for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on cost efficiency and a safety valve to protect against high compliance costs. In contrast, S. 1151 leans towards setting an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities, with larger and more certain reductions expected. Both proposals aim to establish market-based systems to limit emissions, but differ in their approach to achieving this goal. The draft amendment focuses on cost efficiency and a safety valve for high compliance costs, while S. 1151 leans towards setting an absolute cap on emissions with larger and more certain reductions. Both proposals aim to establish market-based systems to limit emissions, with total U.S. emissions expected to continue increasing at a slower rate than forecasted."
