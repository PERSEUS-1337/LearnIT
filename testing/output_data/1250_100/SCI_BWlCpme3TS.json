Character-level models work directly on raw characters, offering a more memory-efficient and compact language representation, especially for multilingual translation. In this study, the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation is explored. Two models are considered: the standard transformer and a novel variant called convtransformer, which uses convolution for character interactions. Evaluation is done on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. Translation performance is compared for both close and distant language pairs. The study compares self-attention models for character-level translation, specifically the standard transformer and convtransformer. Results show that convtransformer outperforms the standard transformer, requiring fewer parameters and producing more robust alignments. Previous work by Lee et al. (2017) also showed promising results in multilingual translation. Multilingual training of character-level models can improve performance and act as a regularizer. Recent studies compare character-level and subword-level models, showing that character-level models can outperform subword-level models with sufficient computational time and capacity. The transformer model, using self-attention instead of recurrence, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. The paper investigates the effectiveness of using attention for character-level modeling in the transformer architecture. A modified version called convtransformer is proposed, with additional sub-blocks in the encoder for character interactions at different granularity levels. The study explores the use of attention for character-level modeling in the transformer architecture, introducing a convtransformer model with sub-blocks for character interactions at various granularity levels. The model fuses representations with a convolutional layer, maintaining input dimensionality. Experiments are conducted on the WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corpora datasets, allowing for multilingual experiments in a consistent domain. The study conducts experiments on multilingual translation using attention in the transformer architecture. Training corpora are sampled from FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset for translation to English. Bilingual and multilingual scenarios are tested without language identifiers, combining input languages for evaluation on different test sets. In Table 1, BLEU performance of character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset is compared, showing character-level transformers outperforming models from previous studies. Character-level training is slower but requires fewer parameters. Multilingual experiments on the UN dataset are reported in Table 2, showing competitive performance of the convtransformer variant. The convtransformer model outperforms the transformer on the UN dataset for multilingual translation tasks, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement. Training on similar input languages leads to better performance, while training on distant languages can still be effective but only when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, resulting in an overall training speedup.

Analyzing learned character alignments in multilingual models reveals potential challenges in achieving high-quality alignments due to architecture limitations or dissimilar languages. Canonical correlation analysis is used to quantify alignments from encoder-decoder attention. The study analyzes alignment matrices from encoder-decoder attention in transformer and convtransformer models for multilingual translation. Results show strong correlation for similar languages but a drop with distant languages, with convtransformer being more robust. Self-attention models are investigated for character-level translation, with the convtransformer outperforming the transformer on multilingual tasks. The study explores the use of self-attention models for character-level translation, showing competitive performance with subword-level models. Training on multiple input languages is effective, especially for similar languages, but performance drops for distant languages. Future work includes analyzing additional languages and improving training efficiency. Model outputs and alignments are presented for bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets. The study compares transformer and convtransformer models for bilingual and multilingual translation. Convtransformer shows sharper weight distribution for matching characters, less noisy alignments for close languages, and better preservation of word alignments for distant languages. Convtransformer is more robust for multilingual translation of distant languages. The convtransformer model demonstrates better preservation of word alignments for distant languages, addressing regulatory and implementation gaps in governance for sustainable development. The institutional framework for sustainable development needs to address regulatory and implementation gaps to be effective.
