    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation like net metering. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged states to adopt net metering to offset energy provided by utilities with on-site generation. State net metering policies are relevant to discussions on renewable energy sources like solar in the nation's electricity system. Solar photovoltaic is the most commonly deployed energy type. Net metering policies, including solar photovoltaic as the most common energy type, interact with federal and state policies to determine the pace of distributed solar energy deployment. Recent state policy changes may either expand or slow down solar energy development. Congress could potentially restrict, encourage, or require state policy modifications regarding net metering. This report provides background information and discusses current issues related to net metering policy, which determines how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for the electricity they deliver to the grid. Net metering policies compensate electricity customers with distributed generation for the electricity they deliver to the grid. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. These policies provide financial support for distributed generation. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place requiring utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some states having alternatives to net energy metering. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in 2018, representing about 1% of U.S. electricity customers. Participation in net metering programs has been increasing, with data showing growth in the number of customers from 2013 to 2018. Net metering participation varies by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. Ratemaking allocates utility costs to customers, with complexities and local factors influencing the process. The ratemaking process for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities involves state regulators approving rates for the utility to charge customers. Costs recovered through customer bill payments include building and operating power plants, maintaining transmission and distribution systems, regular utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and a return on utility investments. The ratemaking process for utilities involves setting volumetric rates for customers based on their electricity consumption. This allows the utility to recover its total costs, including generation, transmission, and distribution expenses. Customer bills consist of volumetric charges and a fixed customer charge. The ratemaking process for utilities involves setting charges based on electricity consumption, including volumetric rates and fixed customer charges. Some customer classes may have special system modifications and demand charges for high-consuming customers. States have different approaches to net metering compensation, which can impact DG deployment. Net metering compensates customers at the utility's retail rate of electricity, seen as a proxy for the value of solar or DG. Initially considered a simple approach due to small customer numbers and energy quantities, retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation. Retail rates for electricity reflect the total costs incurred by the utility, including generating electricity and maintaining the grid. Net metering customers may recover upfront costs of a DG system more quickly through retail rates, potentially leading to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. This arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers, as net metering reduces the need for utility-provided electricity but not necessarily other services like grid maintenance. Solar net metering customers may consume electricity from the grid at night and benefit from grid reliability even during sunny days. Non-net metering customers could face rate increases to cover grid maintenance costs not covered by net metering customers. Concerns over equity arise as net metering customers tend to have higher incomes. Studies vary on the extent of cross-subsidies between net metering and non-net metering customers, influenced by different methodologies and local factors. Cross-subsidies may not be consistent across states and over time. One synthesis of estimates conducted in or around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer per year. Observers may disagree on the need for policy action regarding cross-subsidies. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, including net metering, and found that DG would likely result in rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers, as it depends on participation rates and regulatory decisions. Addressing cost shifts may be delayed. Some states are considering changes to address cost shifts in ratemaking decisions for distributed generation (DG). This includes adding fixed charges or adjusting compensation rates for net metering customers to recover grid maintenance costs. States are exploring options to mitigate potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation. Some states are considering changes to address cost shifts in ratemaking decisions for distributed generation (DG). This includes adding fixed charges or adjusting compensation rates for net metering customers to recover grid maintenance costs. Proponents argue that fixed charges increase fairness and reduce cost shifting, while opponents claim that net metering promotes competition and societal benefits of DG are ignored. Determining accurate fixed charges for net metering customers has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted alternative compensation rates to reflect energy costs utilities avoid when customers supply their own energy. Net metering customers can be compensated through an avoided cost rate or a value of solar rate, which reflects energy costs utilities avoid when customers supply their own energy. The avoided cost rate primarily reflects energy production costs, while the value of solar rate also considers societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates generally prefer the value of solar rate. Solar advocates prefer including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design, with some states considering reduced greenhouse gas emissions as a benefit of distributed solar PV. The Value of Solar (VOS) rate, larger than avoided cost rates but smaller than retail rates, can be set higher depending on perceived solar benefits. New York is one state implementing a related compensation rate for distributed energy resources (DERs). Debates on alternative compensation approaches focus on which costs and benefits to consider and how to quantify them, with challenges in quantifying the time-sensitive costs and benefits of distributed generation (DG). States vary in their approach to evaluating net metering, with differences in compensation, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership. These factors can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG). Program caps limit the number of participants based on power units like megawatts or a percentage of electricity demand. Program caps in net metering policies can impact the promotion of distributed generation (DG) by limiting participants based on power units like megawatts or a percentage of electricity demand. States specify eligible generation sources, often favoring solar energy, but other factors like cost and customer type can also influence participation. Net metering policies vary by state, with some compensating customers for total electricity generated while others only compensate for surplus generation. Customers with surplus generation receive credits on their next bill, with different states having varying policies on credit retention. This can impact the extent to which customers can reduce their electricity costs to $0. Many net metering customers have a single generator behind a single electricity meter. Many net metering customers have a single generator behind a single electricity meter, like a rooftop solar installation. Other arrangements include aggregate net metering for customers with multiple meters, shared net metering for multiple customers with the same generation capacity, and virtual net metering for shared projects on-site. Third party participation, such as solar leasing, is another policy consideration. Legislation has been introduced at the federal level to address state net metering policies. In the 114th and 116th Congress, various bills were introduced to address state net metering policies. These bills aimed to limit state regulators' ability to change compensation rates for net metering customers, require studies on the costs and benefits of net metering, and mandate the consideration of net billing policies for community solar. Additionally, legislation proposed studies by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on different aspects of net metering."
