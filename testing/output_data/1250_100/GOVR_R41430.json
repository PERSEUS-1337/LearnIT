    "content": "Inland waterways, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, cover 38 states and handle half of all inland waterway freight. The Corps funds maintenance and construction through appropriations and user fees. The current financing system for inland waterway system investments is facing challenges, with a shortfall in funding for major capital expenditures. Congress is considering proposals for future financing, including potential changes to the existing fuel tax. The ongoing funding issues are limiting new construction projects and may continue to do so without congressional action. The use of inland waterways for commercial transport predates the nation's founding. Federal government began funding waterways in early 1800s to benefit commerce. Inland waterways account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. Despite decreased reliance due to rail and highway transport, waterways remain important for some regions. In some regions of the country, inland waterways are a primary means of transport for grain, oilseed exports, and bulk products like coal, petroleum, and chemicals. Despite projections for increased traffic, actual traffic on inland waterways has remained flat over the last 20 years. Overall freight tonnage is expected to double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic projected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with almost 90% of tonnage transported through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s changed the financing system for inland waterways, with the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 creating the current financing framework for Corps inland waterway projects. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to fund investments in construction. These changes shifted financial and decision-making responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 set a fuel tax of $0.20 per gallon in 1994, not adjusted for inflation. It established a cost-sharing process for inland waterway projects, with 50% funded by the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and 50% by the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Construction projects require authorization and annual appropriations from Congress. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 set a fuel tax of $0.20 per gallon in 1994 and established a cost-sharing process for inland waterway projects. WRDA 1986 also established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) to inform federal decision-making on IWTF projects. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) meets regularly three times a year to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress regarding investments in the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). The IWTF balance varied between 1986 and 2011, with balances peaking at $413 million in 2002. Despite proposals to increase fees on the user industry and require the IWTF to fund operations and maintenance, these were not enacted by Congress. From FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly, exceeding fuel tax collections and interest on the balance. This led to a sharp decline in balances from 2005 to 2010, prompting efforts to reduce stress on the IWTF. Balances fell sharply from 2005 to 2010, prompting Congress to take \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable levels. These measures included exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, providing funding under ARRA, and limiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding. These actions stabilized the trust fund balance. Funding for new inland waterways projects is expected to be limited without changes to IWTF financing. Most funding is projected to go to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River, potentially increasing the project backlog. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process, leading to reforms in project delivery processes in FY2006. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River has faced cost overruns and planning issues, with the estimated cost increasing significantly over time. The project was 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with the lock components finished and the dam and demolition components expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024, respectively. Concerns have been raised about the solvency of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the equity of the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways. The Bush and Obama Administrations proposed various solutions to address the solvency of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the equity of the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways. Recent proposals included a lock usage fee and an increase in fuel tax, with the user industry presenting its own differing proposal. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to generate additional revenue for the IWTF starting in FY2009. The fee would phase in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber length, with fees tied to IWTF balances after 2012. However, both the House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this approach, citing concerns about the burden it would place on lock users. The Obama Administration also proposed new user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress. The FY2010 budget proposed a new user fee for inland waterways, similar to the Bush Administration's proposal, with an option to increase fees at high-traffic locks. The Obama Administration continued to propose user fees in recent budgets, but Congress has generally rejected these proposals. The FY2013 and FY2014 budgets assumed new revenues from an unspecified user fee, but none of these proposals have been enacted. The 2011 Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers set by the Corps to achieve revenue targets. This proposal aimed to increase IWTF revenues by approximately $1 billion over 10 years. The Obama Administration proposed changes to the inland waterway financing structure, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to increase IWTF revenues by $1 billion over 10 years. The proposal also included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but faced opposition from the user industry. In response, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) presented its own proposal, known as the Inland Marine Transportation Systems Capital Investment Strategy Team report, which has been favored by the industry and introduced as legislation in Congress. The IWUB report recommended increasing user fees, the federal share of inland waterway costs, overall spending on inland waterways, and IWUB involvement in project planning. The report was not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration and some recommendations have been opposed by the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommends increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon to generate approximately $112 million per year in fuel tax revenues for the IWTF. Most of the new revenue would not be spent immediately, allowing the IWTF to replenish its balances. The proposed increase would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. The IWUB report suggests shifting more of the cost for inland waterway projects to the federal government by increasing federal funding and reducing cost-sharing. This includes exempting dam-related expenses and smaller lock rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements. The report also proposes capping IWTF funds to discourage construction cost overruns, which would increase the federal share for new projects to around 70% over the next 25 years. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, with full funding for the proposed investments requiring approximately $380 million annually. This would be a significant increase over historical averages and FY2011 expenditures, with most of the increase coming from the General Revenue fund in the immediate future. Federal funding would need to be $1.33 billion over the first five years to meet the report's requirements. The report proposes increased funding for inland waterways projects, with federal funding exceeding 50% of required investments. Recommendations include increased involvement of the IWUB in project delivery, appointing representatives to project design teams, obtaining sign-off on project plans, and providing status updates on planning documents. The IWUB seeks changes as nonfederal cost-sharers representatives, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Specific projects prioritized for funding based on asset condition and system performance improvement. Final decision on funding still to be made by Congress or Corps. Proposal aims to increase likelihood of project selection. The proposal recommends selection criteria for inland waterway projects similar to those in the report. Advocates suggest shifting costs from the federal government to increase user-financed share. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that the current tax system distorts actual costs of maintaining the system. User fees based on true costs would increase economic efficiency, resulting in higher costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Several proposals have been made to increase user fees on inland waterways in order to make them self-funding and achieve savings for the federal government. These proposals aim to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs, with estimated savings ranging from $1 billion to $4 billion over the next five to ten years. Several proposals have been suggested to increase user fees on inland waterways to save approximately $4 billion over a 10-year period. The proposals focus on raising new revenues through various forms of user fees, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals differ in their approaches and raise important questions for Congress regarding the level of new investment needed for the inland waterway system. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) made changes to inland waterways financing in the 113th Congress, including project delivery recommendations, federal responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million, and reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. Efforts were also authorized to study revenue collection efficiency and potential financing options for the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The House and Senate have made changes to inland waterways financing, including reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Project under the WRRDA. However, these changes may not be enough to finance all needed upgrades in the long-term, leading to proposals for user fees to address the IWTF's solvency. Stand-alone legislation such as H.R. 1149 has been proposed in Congress to address this issue. The WAVE4 Act and RIVER Act propose fuel tax increases and alterations to cost-sharing for dam construction and rehabilitation on federal waterways. Congress is considering infrastructure investments for aging waterways, with commercial users advocating for additional funding. Some argue for increased investment in inland waterways due to aging infrastructure and environmental benefits, while others, including taxpayer and environmental groups, oppose increased federal funding. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system is inadequate. The Corps may only have funding for one lock replacement project without additional revenue or appropriations. The Corps may delay IWTF construction projects without new revenue or appropriations from Congress. Aging infrastructure has led to decreased efficiency on inland waterways, with locks past their intended design age. Some advocate for new lock construction, while others argue for maintenance to extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. Some groups argue for extending the life of existing locks to save costs compared to new construction. The Corps notes the difficulty in predicting future trade scenarios that justify new navigation alternatives. Traffic forecasts depend on various factors, with total domestic freight traffic expected to increase by 70% by 2020, but projections for inland waterway freight traffic are uncertain. Shipping interests advocate for increased efficiency in inland waterways to alleviate pressure on highway and rail shipments. Future lock upgrades could boost demand for waterways, but some question the accuracy of traffic projections. The Corps has refrained from using projected traffic increases to guide investments in inland waterways. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways, citing studies that show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail and highway transportation. They argue that inland waterways contribute fewer greenhouse gas emissions and offer benefits like reduced congestion and noise. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the accuracy of industry studies, particularly regarding fuel efficiency calculations and technical factors like river flow constraints. Environmental groups raise concerns about the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species. Structural changes like locks, dams, and levees alter natural flows, increase turbidity, and cause bank erosion. Congress is considering additional investment and changes to financing, including proposals for increased revenue like the IWUB's fuel tax increase and the White House's suggestions. The IWUB proposes an increase to the fuel tax, while the White House suggests new annual fees in addition to the current fuel tax. Other options include a lock usage fee or toll system. The IWUB argues that the fuel tax increase would rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments, but some groups find the associated federal cost share responsibilities unacceptable. The Obama Administration's 2011 proposal aims to raise new fees from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The Obama Administration proposes new fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and additional fees for non-lock users. Lock users would pay a higher fee on top of the fuel tax. The proposal aims to add new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list to increase revenues. The IWUB and Congress have opposed the new fees, arguing that they unfairly burden waterway users and go against the interconnected nature of the system. Major fee increases could significantly impact shippers operating within the system. The user industry opposes the proposed new fee as it delegates fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Various revenue-raising options have been considered, such as lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and capital recovery user fees. These proposals aim to supplement or replace the current fuel tax on inland waterways. Fees may increase when IWTF balance drops below a certain level, with annualized or per-use fees structured to recover capital costs over time. This concept is seen in the Obama Administration proposal, tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Congress could also explore options like automatic inflation adjustments for fuel tax or new lockage fees to increase revenue stream reliability for inland waterways. If no long-term solution is enacted to address the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure the trust fund's solvency. Options could include capping IWTF withdrawals at current fuel tax revenues or temporarily halting new contracts. Congress might also consider exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, but this would require additional funds from the General Revenue account. The balance of cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects is also a question before Congress. The IWUB proposal aims to modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects. It suggests excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-sharing requirements, shifting funding to 100% federal funding. The proposal also sets a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects. The IWUB proposes to increase the threshold for federally funded projects to $100 million and make all cost overruns 100% federal responsibility. This would shift the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal, increasing the burden on the federal government. Critics argue that this change represents an additional hidden cost to the federal government not reflected in the IWUB report's estimates. Environmental groups point out that the IWTF already receives significant federal support, with 100% funding for investigations and operations. This has amounted to an extra $500 million-$650 million annually in federal expenses. The federal government currently covers about 80%-85% of inland waterways costs, but under the proposal, this could rise to over 90%. While user fees may increase, the cost-share structure between federal and nonfederal expenditures would remain at 50/50. Some argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. Waterway users may need to pay for construction, major rehabilitation costs, and some or all operations and maintenance costs. Congress has previously rejected these proposals but may reconsider due to government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has requested Congress to provide reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes to increase involvement and improve project prioritization. Industry users believe these reforms will reduce cost overruns, which have been an issue for IWTF projects in the past. The IWUB has requested Congress to provide reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes to increase involvement and improve project prioritization. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system to be adopted as a regulation, potentially changing Congress's role in project selection and funding. If a prioritization system recommended by the IWUB report is implemented as a regulation, the Corps would use it to select projects for funding, potentially reducing Congress's role to providing authorizations and funding levels. This shift could align with how other agencies allocate project funds."
