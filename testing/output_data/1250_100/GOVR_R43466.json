These medications are prescribed to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring the use of psychotropic medications in foster children, as federal law requires states to oversee their prescription drug use. Child welfare agencies investigate abuse or neglect of children, with some placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. Most children enter foster care due to neglect or abuse by parents. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services assists states in monitoring appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in care. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system. The national foster care caseload has been decreasing for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care. States aim to find permanent homes for children in foster care while ensuring their safety and well-being. Children in foster care often experience abuse or neglect before entering the system, leading to serious mental health outcomes. This can result in difficulties regulating emotions, interpreting cues, and socializing, potentially leading to violent or aggressive behaviors. A national survey found that a significant percentage of children in foster care are at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, much higher than the general population. Children in foster care, especially those with Medicaid eligibility based on their status, are increasingly diagnosed with mental health disorders such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. The prevalence of these diagnoses varies by age, with older children more likely to be diagnosed. From 2002 to 2007, there was an increase in mental health diagnoses among children in foster care, with attention disorders being the most common diagnosis for children ages 6 to 11. Rates of major mental health diagnoses among children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility based on their status increased from 2002 to 2007. Children ages 6 to 11 were commonly diagnosed with attention disorders and conduct disorders, while children ages 12 to 18 were more likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorders and depression. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for children in foster care, with coordinated services available through Medicaid. Children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility are entitled to a range of medical services under the state's Medicaid plan, including primary and acute care, long-term care, and services through the EPSDT program. This program covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services at regular intervals. Under EPSDT, states must provide treatment to meet children's identified health needs, including mental health needs. Medicaid financing can be used for services like case management, psychiatrists, psychologists, and prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment, such as counseling and case management. Certain interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy have been found to be moderately effective for children with disruptive behaviors. CBT activities like anger management and social skills training are effective for children with trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. However, there is concern about over-reliance on medication due to lack of access to behavioral health care for children in foster care. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain in their own homes following an investigation of alleged abuse or neglect. Medicaid claims data shows an increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children taking antipsychotic medication. Studies have highlighted the need for mental health care for children in foster care. Studies have shown that children in foster care may not always receive needed mental health services, with 3 out of 10 not receiving any specialty mental health services or psychotropics. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care far exceed those among children generally, with children in foster care receiving psychotropic medication at a much higher rate compared to other children served by Medicaid. Research has shown that rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care vary by state and over time, with differences in prescribing practices across states being a significant factor. Children in non-relative foster family homes were found to be no more likely than child-welfare involved children living in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication. This study does not include children in foster care group settings or residential treatment facilities, where higher rates of psychotropic use are observed. The study found variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care based on Medicaid eligibility, with an increase in antipsychotic medication use across most states from 2002 to 2007. In 2007, the annual rate of antipsychotic medication use ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. The study analyzed antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care based on Medicaid eligibility. It showed an increase from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children with Medicaid or private insurance had lower levels of antipsychotic use. The data was primarily from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), funded by HHS, which examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The NSCAW II data showed that children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those living with their own parents following an investigation of child abuse or neglect. Ages of the children ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up periods. Children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those living with their own parents. At 18 months following the investigation, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications than those who remained in their homes. Among children placed in foster care, psychotropic medication use was significantly greater for those who lived in foster group homes or residential treatment programs. Children in group foster care settings had a high prevalence of psychotropic medication use, with rates ranging from 48.2% to 67.4%. This was significantly higher compared to children in other foster care settings, those who remained in their own homes, and those in informal kin care. The trend continued 36 months after the initial investigation, with over half of children in group settings still taking psychotropics. Children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rates of children taking more than one psychotropic medication, with about half of them taking two or more drugs. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings were significantly more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or residential settings, had higher rates of using multiple psychotropic medications. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropics, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. The research literature has identified patterns of overprescribing psychotropic drugs to foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young.\" Polypharmacy, defined as concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 30 days, was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually among all foster children on Medicaid from 2002 to 2007. An analysis of Medicaid claims data for children in foster care and non-foster care status in 2011 showed comparable rates of polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs. Concerns have been raised about the use of multiple antipsychotic medications due to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. The percentage of children in group or residential settings prescribed three or more psychotropic medications was significantly higher compared to other groups. Concerns have been raised about the overprescription of psychotropic medications to very young children in foster care, with studies showing high rates of prescriptions for infants under the age of 1. Research also indicates an increase in prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with each year of age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care. Health experts emphasize the lack of established mental health indications for the use of psychotropic drugs in infants. The use of psychotropic drugs in infants and young children in foster care is a concern due to potential serious health effects. While these children may benefit from psychotropic medications, they may not always be effective in treating their mental health needs. The lack of psychosocial services for children in care could contribute to the increased use of psychotropics. Antipsychotics, often used off-label for bipolar disorders and schizophrenia in children, have seen a steady increase in prescription rates. The share of children in foster care prescribed antipsychotic medication has increased from 2005 to 2010. This trend may be influenced by limited research on the efficacy of these medications in children and pharmaceutical companies marketing drugs. The use of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care, has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders. Research on the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for children, especially those in foster care, is limited. The analysis found limited evidence on the efficacy of psychotropic medications in children, with concerns about bias in studies funded by pharmaceutical companies. Antipsychotics have been linked to harmful health outcomes in some children. Despite these concerns, some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing mental health and behavior issues related to complex trauma. Stimulants are effective in treating ADHD symptoms in children, especially those in foster care who have higher rates of mental health diagnoses. There is a concern about the use of psychotropic medications in this population due to multiple placements and inconsistent oversight practices. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medication use in children in foster care. In 2005, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing to examine the enrollment of children in foster care in clinical drug trials. Congress required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for children in foster care's medical treatment. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for these children was discussed in congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. The law directed states to develop a coordinated strategy for oversight of drugs prescribed to children in foster care. In 2011, further amendments stipulated protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for these children. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on state policies for overseeing the prescribing of psychotropic medications to foster children and vulnerable child populations. GAO found that the six states reviewed fell short of comprehensive oversight as defined by best practice guidelines. Only one state fully implemented consent procedures, raising concerns about caregivers' awareness of the risks and benefits of psychotropic medications. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance for state agencies on this issue. HHS may endorse guidance for state Medicaid and child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Witnesses discussed increasing cooperation between agencies and providing guidance on best practices. A former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications. Senate Finance Committee also addressed issues with psychotropic medication use in foster care. At a roundtable, current and former foster youth shared their experiences with psychotropic medication and highlighted the importance of therapy in transitioning from medication. Child welfare stakeholders discussed strategies to address trauma in foster care, including the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives to psychotropics. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses at the May 2014 hearing included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau, GAO, a researcher focusing on psychotropic medication use among children in care, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO's work from 2011 to 2014 focused on psychotropic medication prescription among children in foster care, examining prescribing rates and the quality of documentation supporting the use of psychotropics. Experts found varying quality in documentation, with some cases having partial support for dosage amounts and concurrent medication use. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication for children in foster care, particularly regarding psychotropic medication use. State officials in seven states developed practices to support appropriate mental health diagnoses and treatment for foster children, including mental health screenings and monitoring after medication is prescribed. State officials in seven states developed guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services for foster children. Factors such as collaboration among agencies and gradual rollout of new practices were critical in implementing oversight work. State officials use various measures to gauge results, including physician prescribing practices and monitoring child outcomes. GAO did not examine the effectiveness of state practices or compliance with policies. HHS has supported states in their oversight work since 2014. HHS has supported states in oversight work since 2014, recommending cost-effective ways to convene state stakeholders for collaboration on psychotropic medication oversight. Federal agencies have promoted interagency cooperation and publicized best practices for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children, including those in foster care. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets. The Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program requires states to develop a coordinated strategy for ensuring access to healthcare, including mental health and dental care, for children in foster care. This strategy must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, with input from healthcare experts. It should include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, and sharing of medical information for children in care. The federal child welfare law requires states to ensure access to healthcare for children in foster care, including the development of electronic health records, continuity of care, oversight of prescription medicines, consultation with medical professionals, and transition planning for children aging out of foster care. Health-related records for each child must include provider information, immunization records, medication details, and other relevant health information. The federal child welfare law mandates states to provide healthcare access for foster children, including electronic health records, medication oversight, and transition planning. States report to HHS on psychotropic medication oversight through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports. These reports detail protocols for mental health screening, treatment consent, medication monitoring, and communication. The federal child welfare law mandates states to provide healthcare access for foster children, including oversight of psychotropic medications. In FY2015-FY2019, jurisdictions reported on protocols for medication monitoring and appropriate use. HHS convened a working group in 2011 to address research on psychotropic medication use among foster children and support state efforts in implementing requirements. The group aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, and research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care. Led by ACF, the group includes representatives from other HHS agencies. The working group, led by ACF, includes representatives from HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA. CMS administers Medicaid for financing screenings, assessments, therapy, and prescription drugs for eligible children. SAMHSA administers block grant funding for non-Medicaid covered treatment services and supports projects related to trauma in children. In 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter to state agencies addressing prescription medication management for children in foster care. State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities collaborate to improve health, including medication use and prescription monitoring structures for children in out-of-home care. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. They also held question and answer sessions for state leaders to enhance oversight and monitoring. In August 2012, HHS convened state leaders to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and mental health needs. The summit aimed to enhance collaboration on oversight and implementation of changes. Multiple presentations were given on psychotropic oversight. Since then, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS have taken steps to improve oversight. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. The guidance emphasized coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. ACF also issued separate guidance on improving behavioral and social-emotional outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development and its impact on social and emotional well-being. ACF published guides on tools for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and for child welfare staff on mental health issues. They awarded funds to support projects for youth with mental health needs and trauma. SAMHSA provided funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. The Technical Assistance Network at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work collaborates with child and adolescent psychiatrists in state and county governments to address psychotropic medication issues. They use a community listerv and webinars to disseminate best practices, including for children on Medicaid. The CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services issued an informational bulletin in August 2012 to help states oversee psychotropic medication use, including in vulnerable populations like children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples of oversight methods provided. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued guidance in 2013 to emphasize the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced complex trauma. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being by providing performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. The FY2017 budget proposed incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies for improved care coordination and delivery of psychosocial interventions to Medicaid-eligible children in foster care. States could also apply for grant funding to implement alternative interventions and build capacity. ACF would support activities to ensure fidelity to evidence-based models and evaluate the work, focusing on overseeing the use of psychotropic medication for children in care. Researchers have conducted surveys of states to learn about their policies related to the oversight of psychotropic medications, specifically focusing on children in foster care. More than half of the states surveyed rated psychotropic medication use as a high concern. Researchers conducted surveys of states to assess their policies on psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. About half of the states rated this issue as a high concern, with varying levels of policy development and implementation. Concerns were raised about the lack of systematic approaches to improve outcomes for these children. Researchers reviewed policies on oversight of psychotropic drug use among children in care from 16 states, finding many policies were underdeveloped and lacked key criteria. States have taken steps to address oversight, with some collaborating to improve policies. Care Strategies collaborated with six states from 2012 to 2015 in the Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative, involving state agencies to define terms, measures, and best practices for oversight of psychotropic medication use among foster youth. States implemented protocols for consent, real-time data collection, red flag reviews, and tailored monitoring processes. The Center for Health Care Strategies, with SAMSHA support, provides technical assistance on psychotropic medication oversight. The study looked at psychotropic medication use among children who had contact with the child welfare agency due to abuse or neglect. Data was collected at baseline, 18 months, and 36 months after the investigation. The analysis included children in foster care settings. The study analyzed psychotropic medication use among children in foster care and those not in foster care. Initial survey results did not show statistically significant differences, but at 18 and 36 months, children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medications. Differences were significant for children ages 6 to 10 at the 18-month follow-up. For children ages 11 through 17 years, there was no statistical significance between the in-home and foster care groups at the initial survey. However, significant differences were found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up."
