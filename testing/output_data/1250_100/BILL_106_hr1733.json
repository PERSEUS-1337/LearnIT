    "content": "The \"Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship Act\" aims to encourage individuals, especially those from underrepresented groups, to pursue careers in addressing global energy and environmental challenges. This Act authorizes doctoral fellowships. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to award Paul E. Tsongas Doctoral Fellowships for study and research in science or engineering fields related to energy or the environment. Fellowships are awarded for three academic years and can be used at any accredited institution. The number of fellowships awarded each year is based on full funding. Recipients are designated as \"Paul E. Tsongas Fellows.\" ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION OF FELLOWS: Paul E. Tsongas Doctoral Fellowships are awarded by the Secretary of Energy for study and research in energy or environmental science/engineering fields. Recipients, known as \"Paul E. Tsongas Fellows,\" receive funding for three academic years at accredited institutions. The Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship Board, appointed by the Secretary in consultation with the Director of the National Science Foundation, consists of 5 representatives from the academic science and engineering communities. The Board establishes policies, criteria for awarding fellowships, awards fellowships, and submits reports to Congress every 3 years regarding program modifications. Only United States citizens are eligible for awards under this Act. The Board consists of 5 representatives from the academic science and engineering communities. Members serve 3-year terms, with a maximum of 6 years. The Secretary calls the first meeting, electing a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson for 1 year, then subsequent officers for 2-year terms. A majority of members form a quorum, meeting at least once a year to fulfill responsibilities. Members of the Board are entitled to compensation fixed by the Secretary, not exceeding level IV of the Executive Schedule. Travel expenses may be allowed when serving away from home. The Board must consider underrepresented groups when designing selection criteria and awarding fellowships. The Act does not require preferential treatment for underrepresented groups but emphasizes expanding access to careers lacking diversity. The Act provides stipends of $15,000, $16,500, and $18,000 for the first, second, and third years of study, respectively. It covers tuition, fees, and health insurance for fellowship recipients and includes a $5,000 annual allowance for administrative and travel expenses. Each Fellow must complete a 3-month internship related to their dissertation topic at an approved institution. No student receiving support under this Act must maintain satisfactory progress in their field of study or research, without engaging in gainful employment unrelated to their academic pursuits. The Secretary may require reports from fellowship recipients to ensure compliance with program requirements. Failure to earn a degree may result in consequences determined by the Secretary. Students who fail or abandon their course of study funded under this Act may be required to repay a portion of the fellowship assistance received, along with interest and collection fees, as determined by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and as needed for future years. The General Educational Provisions Act's Section 421 regarding fund availability applies to this Act. Definitions include the Secretary of Energy and the host institution for Paul E. Tsongas Fellows pursuing doctoral studies."
