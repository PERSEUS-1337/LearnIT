    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Accountability Act of 2004\". Congress finds allegations of mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program, as identified in audits by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. The audits revealed inadequate management of contracts, including failure to adhere to provisions, maintain staffing levels, overcharge the United Nations, and engage in unprofessional conduct. The United Nations Office of Iraq Programs was found to have engaged in unprofessional conduct and misreported figures for goods. The OIOS recommended strengthening contract management and criticized the lack of oversight in Iraq. The United Nations denied the US access to OIOS audits of the Oil-for-Food Program, hindering member states' ability to fulfill their responsibilities. The United Nations' nondisclosure policy hinders member states' access to OIOS audit reports, undermining their responsibilities in connection with UN programs. The United Nations' accountability and transparency measures include urging the President to ensure OIOS audit reports are accessible to member states and requiring a report on financial disclosure rules for UN officials within 180 days. The Act defines key terms such as the \"oil-for-food program\" and the \"Office of Internal Oversight Services.\" The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House and Senate. The curr_chunk refers to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate."
