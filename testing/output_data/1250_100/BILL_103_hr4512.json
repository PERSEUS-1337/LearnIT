    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of the Act. The Congress recognizes the need to create entry-level jobs for welfare recipients to transition into permanent employment, emphasizing the value of work experience in the private sector. A one-year tax credit is proposed to incentivize businesses to hire AFDC recipients and break the cycle of welfare dependency. A one-year tax credit should be extended to businesses for wages paid to employees whose employment results in a termination of AFDC eligibility. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section providing a refundable credit for hiring AFDC recipients. A credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% of wages up to $6,000 and 25% of wages exceeding $6,000 but not exceeding $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services rendered during the 1-year period starting when the individual begins work for the employer, with limitations if the individual rendered services for other employers. The term 'qualified wages' refers to wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients during the taxable year. A qualified former AFDC recipient is an individual certified by a designated local agency as a member of a family receiving benefits under a State plan before employment with the employer, whose wages make the family ineligible for benefits. This term excludes individuals who are part of a targeted group. The text discusses the prohibition on replacing existing workers for obtaining credit under section 51(d) and includes technical amendments to the code. The amendments in this section apply to individuals starting work for the employer after the enactment of the Act."
