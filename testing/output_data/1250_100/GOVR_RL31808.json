    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which included funding for transportation and election reform projects. The Act also included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with a recommended $91.0 billion budget. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill passed by the House of Representatives included an additional $4.5 billion in highway funding, totaling $85.8 billion. Key differences from the Administration request were an extra $4.4 billion for highways and the removal of $3.4 billion for airport grants. This bill consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury into a single bill. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill underwent changes due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This resulted in the reorganization of subcommittees in the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Various agencies were transferred to DHS, and budget numbers were adjusted for comparison. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill underwent changes due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, resulting in reorganization of subcommittees. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% rescission for most accounts in the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request was $85.9 billion, $740 million below the final FY2003 figure. Total funding allocation within the request is shown in Table 2. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill underwent changes due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck on points of order, reducing total transportation funding in the bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contains an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill underwent changes due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%, which is not reflected in the funding trends for transportation and treasury appropriations from FY1999-FY2004. Adjustments were made to the figures for Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations for comparison purposes. The FY2004 Department of Transportation Appropriations request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act. The budget proposed changes to highway and transit funding structures in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The request included a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below the FY2003 enacted level of $55.7 billion. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill figures differ from the Administration's totals due to offsets and funding actions. Funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement programs was struck during House deliberations, reducing total transportation funding in the bill. These figures reflect across-the-board rescissions and may not include all funding adjustments. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill includes additional funding for various programs such as the Essential Air Service program, Appalachian Development Highway System, motor carrier safety activities, and NHTSA. Congress also postponed Amtrak's loan repayment and there are $14 million in permanent appropriations. Total resources for RSPA in FY2003 were $119 million, and total funding for FY2004 is $132 million. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill provides additional funding for various programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 gives the FAA $13.93 billion, an increase of $440 million from FY2003. The majority of the funding is allocated for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill provides additional funding for various programs, with the FAA receiving $13.93 billion, an increase of $440 million from FY2003. The majority of the funding is allocated for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. The funding split between trust fund and general fund contributions has been a key part of the annual FAA budget debate, with the FY2004 Act raising the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill provides $13.93 billion for the FAA, with a focus on Operations & Maintenance expenses. The funding split between trust fund and general fund contributions has been a key part of the annual FAA budget debate. The FY2004 Act includes $7.5 billion for Operations & Maintenance and $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment. The majority of O&M funding is for air traffic control, certification, and safety-related activities, while F&E funding saw a slight decrease from the previous year. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill provides $13.93 billion for the FAA, with a focus on Operations & Maintenance expenses. Unobligated F&E funds of $30 million are subject to rescission in P.L.108-199. F&E funding is used primarily for capital investment in air traffic control and safety. P.L. 108-199 expends $119.4 million on RE&D, slightly more than the Senate proposal. The EAS program receives funding from designated user fees and had $102 million provided in FY2003. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, with $50 million from regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. It rejects the Bush Administration's proposal to reduce the program size and require local contributions. The Act also excludes a pilot cost-sharing program and a provision for community reporting on program coordination and funding improvement. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is allocated $3.4 billion, similar to the previous year. The FY2004 budget proposal requested $3.4 billion for AIP, with the House recommending $3.425 billion. The House-passed bill did not include funding for AIP, but the Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion, including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. The bill prioritized projects at 241 airports and prohibited using AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides $3.4 billion for AIP, prohibiting certain airport improvements. The FHWA budget funds the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The President requested $30.2 billion for FHWA in FY2004, a decrease of $2.2 billion. The President requested $30.2 billion for FHWA in FY2004, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed budget included a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative, aimed at funding \"ready-to-go\" projects to address congestion and improve infrastructure conditions. Additionally, there were proposed changes reflecting the Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal. The House and Senate passed FY2004 appropriations bills for FHWA, with the House bill providing $34.6 billion and the Senate bill providing $34.8 billion. Both bills included provisions to redirect gasohol excise tax revenues to the highway trust fund, adding roughly $600 million in revenue. Earmarking of funds for federal-aid highway discretionary programs continued in both bills. The enacted Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provides $34.7 billion in total budgetary resources for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This represents an increase of over 6% from FY2003 and over 12% from the Administration's budget request. The bill heavily earmarks discretionary programs, directing $175 million for surface transportation projects. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks funds for various transportation programs under FHWA, including core formula programs that were traditionally left free of earmarks. Over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds are earmarked for specific projects, with the federal share being 100%. Funding is drawn from state's distributed core program funds or STP funds distribution, and projects not eligible under core programs are funded from STP funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides a 100% federal share for earmarked projects, a departure from past practices. Nearly $300 million unobligated core formula funds are allocated for interagency transfers and project earmarks, including funds for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Additionally, $150 million is allocated for the Appalachian Development Highway System, with $75 million earmarked for specific projects. TEA-21 Funding Framework, set to expire in 2003, was extended to 2004. It maintained existing transportation programs and funding. The largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, TEA-21 mostly continued highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation. Major federal-aid highway programs include NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ. The TEA-21 Funding Framework, extended to 2004, continued existing transportation programs like NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ. Highway funding includes apportioned, exempt, and allocated programs controlled by FHWA or other entities. FMCSA, created in 1999, took over responsibilities on January 1, 2000. FMCSA became operational on January 1, 2000, taking over responsibilities from DOT's Office of Motor Carrier Safety. It issues and enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, administers grants for state safety programs, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled drivers and vehicles entering the US, and reviews carriers. Funding for FMCSA activities comes mainly from the federal Highway Trust Fund, with an FY2004 budget request of $447 million, a 43% increase from FY2003. The FY2004 budget for FMCSA was $447 million, a significant increase from the previous year. The appropriation included funds for administrative expenses, motor carrier safety grants, and various other programs. The budget for administrative and operations expenses was set at $176 million, with a focus on enforcement, outreach, and the establishment of a medical review board to assist FMCSA. The FY2004 budget for FMCSA included funds for administrative expenses, personnel compensation, outreach efforts, and grants for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. The House approved $190 million, the Senate approved $237 million, and the final agreement was $190 million. These funds support state enforcement of commercial vehicle safety regulations and cover up to 80% of program costs. The FY2004 budget for FMCSA included funds for administrative expenses, personnel compensation, outreach efforts, and grants for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. The Senate bill allocated an additional $47 million for construction of border inspection stations for trucks. The conference agreement for FY2004 includes $170 million for MCSAP, $20 million for information systems and safety initiatives, and $111.5 million for various initiatives such as southern border inspection facilities, operations grants, and CDL improvement grants. NHTSA funding supports programs to improve traffic safety by reducing impaired driving, increasing occupant protection, improving police traffic services, enhancing emergency medical responses to crashes, ensuring compliance with federal vehicle safety regulations, and addressing emerging vehicle safety problems. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, an increase of $231 million from FY2003. $447 million was designated for traffic safety grants to states, focusing on occupant protection and impaired driving, while $218 million was for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. Funding areas included research, highway safety programs, and analysis of crash statistics and vehicle performance. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommend funding for NHTSA and FRA in FY2004. NHTSA's funding includes $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. FRA's funding is mainly for Amtrak, with $900 million requested by the Administration. The House agreed to $900 million, the Senate to $1.346 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $1.225 billion for Amtrak. The Senate, House, and P.L. 108-199 agreed on funding amounts for railroad safety and operations. The President requested increases in funding for railroad safety and research, with the House, Senate, and P.L. 108-199 providing varying amounts. The FRA budget debate focuses on Amtrak, agency safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and state funding for high-speed rail initiatives. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is the primary agency responsible for promoting and regulating railroad safety. The proposed budget for FRA's safety program in FY2004 is $131.2 million, representing a 13% increase from the previous year. The funds are used for salaries, travel, training, and monitoring safety performance in the rail industry. The goals include reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. Funding authority for the program expired in FY1998, and the railroad safety statute was last reauthorized in 1994. The Federal Railroad Administration's safety program funding expired in FY1998, and the railroad safety statute was last reauthorized in 1994. Despite hearings since 1994, there has been no agreement on funding for FRA's regulatory activities. FRA conducts research on topics like employee fatigue and train movement control. The FY2003 DOT appropriation provided $29.1 million for research, with a $35 million request for FY2004. The House Committee recommended $28.2 million for research activities. The House Committee recommended $28.2 million for research activities, while the Senate Committee recommended $34.2 million. The conferees settled on $34 million. The Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program focuses on high-speed train control systems, track technology, corridor planning, and locomotives. The Administration requested $23.2 million for FY2004, with the House agreeing to $28.3 million and the Senate to $29.3 million. P.L. 108-199 ultimately provided $37.4 million, with increased funding for various projects. The House and Senate bills combined different projects for Amtrak funding in FY2004. The President requested $900 million, below Amtrak's FY2003 appropriation. Amtrak stated it could not survive on $900 million, and the DOT Inspector General agreed. The House and Administration agreed to $900 million, while the Senate approved $1.346 billion. P.L. 108-199 provided $1.225 billion for Amtrak, with additional provisions for funding structure and route requirements. P.L. 108-199 directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a competitive bidding procedure for state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak. States can contract with non-Amtrak operators for service, with the option to use Amtrak's equipment and services if needed. The Secretary has the power to compel Amtrak to provide equipment and services if terms cannot be agreed upon. Congress began stipulating in FY2003 that Amtrak's appropriation would go through the Secretary of Transportation, reducing Amtrak's discretion with federal funding. Amtrak was required to submit a 5-year business plan to Congress in 2003. Amtrak submitted a plan to Congress in 2003 requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance and addressing backlogged needs. Two bills aim to reauthorize Amtrak with funding of $2 billion annually for three to six years. Various proposals seek to restructure federal passenger rail policy, including shifting responsibility to states. Sen. Hollings and others have proposed a plan for restructuring Amtrak and passenger rail service, authorizing $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak operations and $48 billion in bonds for capital improvements. President Bush's FY2004 budget request for FTA was $7.226 billion, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The House agreed to $7.231 billion, the Senate to $7.305 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $7.309 billion. The Senate agreed to $7.305 billion for FTA appropriations, while P.L. 108-199 provides $7.309 billion. The Administration's reauthorization proposal has not been approved, so the proposed program changes are not reflected in the funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contains an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. MARAD's mission is to promote the development of a U.S. merchant marine capable of carrying domestic and foreign commerce, and to serve as a naval and military auxiliary in times of war. MARAD administers programs benefiting U.S. vessel owners, shipyards, and crews. The budget for FY2004 requested $219 million, with $226.4 million provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The focus is on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, which provides loans for purchasing ships and modernizing shipyards. The Administration requested no funds for additional loans in FY2004 but asked for $4.5 million for existing loan administration. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003 initially provided $4 million for administrative expenses for the Title XI program, but later $25 million was allocated in the Wartime Supplemental Appropriations bill. The DOT Inspector General recommended MARAD to improve loan application reviews and financial oversight after the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages. The General Accounting Office also identified weaknesses in the program and suggested improvements for financial oversight. The conference agreement highlights MARAD's cooperation with the IG's office for management reforms in the Title XI program. The Administration requested $104.4 million for operations and training, with specific allocations for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, state maritime academies, and MARAD operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $107 million for operations and training. The Administration also requested funding for the Maritime Security Program (MSP) and the disposal of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of surplus ships with environmental concerns. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $16.2 million for ship disposal. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) includes various entities and conducts transportation safety activities with a budget request of $118 million for FY2004. The Administration proposed $67 million for RSPA's pipeline transportation safety program and $25 million for hazardous materials transportation safety in FY2004. Additional funding was requested to enhance RSPA's oversight of hazardous materials transportation regulations and safety of containment systems for nuclear fuel. The House approved $111.3 million for RSPA, with $23.6 million for hazardous materials safety and $64.1 million for pipeline safety. The Senate approved $110.3 million for RSPA, with $22.8 million for hazardous materials safety and $67.6 million for pipeline safety. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $112.9 million for RSPA, including $23.7 million for hazardous materials safety and $66.3 million for pipeline safety. The Department of the Treasury received funding for various functions, including economic policies, financial services for the government, law enforcement, and production of currency. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 led to changes in its responsibilities. The Department of the Treasury serves as the federal government's economic policymaker, financial manager, and revenue collector. It consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with financial responsibilities handled by various bureaus and law enforcement duties carried out by specific agencies. The Department of the Treasury oversees financial management, revenue collection, and law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Secret Service, IRS, and Customs Service. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) transferred some agencies from the Treasury Department to DHS, reducing the Treasury's law enforcement involvement. The Treasury Department also created the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to handle alcohol and tobacco tax collection and regulation previously managed by BATF. The Bush Administration requested $11.408 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004. The Bush Administration requested $11.408 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004, with top priorities including bolstering IRS efforts to enforce tax laws, improving efficiency, combating money laundering, and supporting international efforts. The proposed budget allocated funds mainly to IRS, Financial Management Service, Bureau of Public Debt, and Departmental Offices. Additional funding was requested for FinCen and the International Technical Assistance program. The Administration proposed merging TIGTA with OIG due to transferred functions. The House Committee approved $11.273 billion for Treasury operations in FY2004, $70 million less than requested. H.R. 2989 allocated less funding for IRS operations but more for departmental offices. The House approved increased funding for Treasury departmental offices in FY2004, with a significant portion going towards administrative costs related to personnel transfers. H.R. 2989 also allocated additional funds for specific offices within the Treasury, denied the proposal to merge OIG and TIGTA, and approved funding for FinCen in FY2004. The bill passed in the House with amendments, including one reducing funding for an IRS pilot program. The House rejected an amendment to divert $75 million from an IRS pilot program for earned income tax credit compliance to programs for business taxpayers. Another amendment aimed to prevent the Treasury Department from using funds to assist in overturning a judicial ruling in the Cooper v. IBM case regarding age discrimination in pension plans. The House passed an amendment with a vote of 258 to 160, endorsing funding levels for Treasury departmental offices and operating bureaus. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill providing $11.196 billion for the Treasury Department in FY2004, $202 million more than FY2003 but less than the Bush Administration's request. The difference in funding was mainly due to smaller budgets for IRS operations, including tax processing and information systems. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill (S. 1589) that would have merged IRS accounts for tax law enforcement and the earned income tax credit compliance program, resulting in a drop in funding for the initiative in FY2004. The bill also allocated additional funding for Treasury's departmental offices, with increases for the Office of International Affairs and the Office of Terrorist Finance and Financial Crimes. Additionally, the bill opposed the proposed merger of the OIG and TIGTA, recommending separate funding increases for both entities in FY2004. The Senate approved funding for FinCen of $6.1 million to manage new responsibilities under the USA Patriot Act. The Senate also passed amendments related to Treasury appropriations, including a study on pre-certifying eligibility for the EITC and an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin.

A conference was agreed upon to resolve the differences, resulting in a total funding of $11.166 billion for Treasury Department operations in FY2004. This amount was $317 million more than FY2003, but less than the amounts requested and approved by the Bush Administration, House, and Senate. Funding for the IRS accounted for 92% of total Treasury appropriations in FY2004. The Treasury Department received $11.166 billion in funding for FY2004, with the IRS accounting for 92% of the total appropriations. The House and Senate agreed to incorporate the funding into an appropriations bill (H.R. 2673), which included an across-the-board cut of 0.59% on discretionary spending. The House approved the conference report on December 8, 2003. The House approved the conference report on December 8, 2003, and the Senate did the same on January 22, 2004. President Bush signed the measure into law the next day. The IRS administers various taxes and fees for the federal government, including income taxes, social insurance taxes, and estate and gift taxes. In FY2002, the IRS collected $2,017 billion before refunds, with individual income tax revenue being the largest component at $1,038 billion. The Bush Administration requested $10.436 billion for IRS operations in FY2004, a 6.1% increase from the previous year.

The Administration proposed a new program to curb tax evasion by targeting various sources, including abusive tax schemes, misuse of trusts, and under-reporting of income. They projected a 72% increase in audits for high-income individuals and businesses. Concerns were raised about the funding for IRS operations, overseen by the IRS Oversight Board, which reviews the annual budget request and makes recommendations to Congress. The IRS Oversight Board recommended a budget of $10.724 billion for FY2004, higher than the Bush Administration's request. They also suggested hiring 2,120 full-time employees to improve tax law compliance. The Board aimed to achieve a 2% real growth rate, allocate more resources to the BSM, and restore funds for customer service and enforcement. The House Committee on Appropriations passed a measure providing $10.352 billion for the IRS in FY2004, $85 million less than the Bush Administration's request. The funding was allocated to various accounts including processing, assistance, and management; tax law enforcement; information systems; and business systems modernization. The Committee's report highlighted IRS programs for low-income taxpayers. The House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2989 on September 9, 2003, endorsing recommended funding levels for IRS accounts in FY2004. The bill included funding for low-income taxpayer clinics, tax counseling for elderly taxpayers, the Free-File Alliance, the earned income tax credit program, and hiring private collection agencies for overdue taxes. An amendment adopted by the House prevented funds from being used to overturn a federal judge's ruling on age discrimination in IBM's pension plan.

Two amendments were approved related to the IRS, one preventing the Treasury Department from using funds for a new IRS regulation, and the other requiring a study on a pilot program for EITC certification. The House version of H.R. 2989 provided $76 million more in funding for the IRS for FY2004, distributed among processing, enforcement, and information systems accounts. The House and Senate agreed on a conference to resolve funding differences for the IRS in FY 2004. The total funding would be $10.245 billion, with allocations for processing, assistance, tax law enforcement, information systems, and health insurance tax credit administration. The agreement included specific allocations for programs like Tax Counseling for the Elderly and low-income taxpayer clinics. The conference agreement on H.R. 2989 included a reduction of $39 million in approved amounts for the IRS, reflecting congressional dissatisfaction with program results and distrust of IRS managers. It also prohibited the IRS from using funds to lift a 1999 moratorium on converting pension plans to cash-balance plans, requiring proposed legislation for transition relief instead. Additionally, the IRS was mandated to submit a final report to Congress by June 30, 2005, examining aspects of any certification program established by the agency. The final report on the IRS certification program for EITC eligibility was included in a consolidated appropriations bill (H.R. 2673) with an across-the-board spending cut. The House and Senate approved the conference report, and President Bush signed it into law as P.L. 108-199. The appropriations for the United States Postal Service were detailed in Table 7 of the bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The U.S. Postal Service generates most of its funding through product sales, but also receives appropriations for specific services. Congress is required to reimburse USPS $29 million annually until 2035 for services provided in the 1990s. USPS faced new funding needs after the 2001 terrorist attacks, which they argue should be met through appropriations. In FY2003, USPS received a revenue forgone appropriation of $59.6 million, including $30.8 million for FY2003 and $29 million annually under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993. The Administration proposed $55.7 million for FY2004 and $29 million for FY2003. USPS also had $31 million for FY2002. The Bush Administration had proposed to stop using advance appropriations to avoid spending limitations but did not renew the proposal in subsequent budgets. In its FY2004 budget request, USPS asked Congress for an additional $350 million in emergency response funds to protect employees and customers from threats like the 2001 anthrax attack. The funds would be used for ventilation and filtration equipment. The Administration did not include any additional funds for emergency preparedness in its FY2003 or FY2004 Budgets. USPS submitted an emergency preparedness plan in 2002, requesting substantial appropriations for FY2003 and FY2004. Both the House and Senate versions of the FY2004 bill provided $60 million for emergency response. The House and Senate provided $60 million for emergency response in FY2004, with $29 million for past revenue forgone and $31 million payable in FY2004. They also included $36.5 million for revenue forgone in FY2005. The bill maintained USPS service standards and prohibited closing rural post offices. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act extended the sales period for the Breast Cancer Research semi-postal stamp. The amendment extends the sales authorization for USPS through December 31, 2005. Legislation has been passed to reduce USPS contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, saving USPS $2.9 billion in FY2003 and $2.6 billion in succeeding years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contains an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill funds most offices in the Executive Office of the President, except for three. The President's FY2004 budget proposed consolidating EOP salaries and expenses into a single annual appropriation called \"The White House,\" totaling $183.8 million, a 3.0% decrease from the previous year. This consolidation includes various accounts such as Compensation of the President, White House Office, and National Security Council. The FY2004 budget proposed consolidating EOP salaries and expenses into a single annual appropriation called \"The White House,\" totaling $183.8 million, with a 3.0% decrease from the previous year. The consolidation initiative aims to provide enhanced flexibility in resource allocation and staff support for the President and Vice President, allowing for a more rapid response to changing needs and priorities. Congress has expressed concerns about oversight of public funds and the complexity of separate accounts. The budget also includes a proposal for a 10% transfer authority among various accounts within the White House. The White House proposed consolidating EOP salaries and expenses into a single annual appropriation, allowing for enhanced flexibility in resource allocation. A 10% transfer authority among various accounts within the White House was also included in the budget proposal to address emerging priorities and improve efficiency. The White House proposed consolidating EOP salaries and expenses into a single annual appropriation for enhanced flexibility. The House and Senate Committees recommended separate appropriations for EOP accounts, rejecting the transfer authority proposal. The existing structure allows for reprogramming funds within accounts to address unforeseen budget needs with Committee approval. The President's FY2004 budget for EOP programs funded through Treasury and General Government appropriations proposed an appropriation of $790.6 million, a 1.7% increase from FY2003. The budget included $450,000 for the President's compensation, with a $50,000 expense allowance. The White House Office was allocated $70.3 million for staff assistance and administrative services. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $70.3 million for EOP programs, an increase of 39.5% from FY2003. The House Committee recommended $66.057 million, with $8.65 million for reimbursements to the White House Communications Agency. A detailed report on the status of White House public tours was requested within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Committee also directed reports on the renovations of the Eisenhower. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations requested a report on the renovations of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building by November 15, 2003. They are seeking specific answers regarding the use of non-federal funds for the renovations and furnishings of GSA facilities occupied by agencies of the Executive Office of the President. The Committee wants more information on the $65,757,000 included in the bill for the Eisenhower Executive Office Building renovations. They are asking for details on the federal agency coordinating the work funded by non-federal sources, the specific sources and amounts of non-federal funding used, project descriptions, and explanations for using non-federal funds. Additionally, they want to know which agency's gift authority accepted the non-federal funds and if it was used properly. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $61.9 million for the Homeland Security Council, with $8.65 million available for reimbursements to the White House Communications Agency. The Office of Homeland Security provides support and advice to the President for homeland security coordination. The total appropriation is $69.168 million, with $8.3 million allocated for the OHS out of the $70.3 million requested for the White House Office in FY2004. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $4.1 million for the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) in FY2004, which is $4.2 million less than the President's request of $8.3 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved the same amount as requested by the President. The committee questioned the need for 66 staff members for the Homeland Security Council, as most of the OHS responsibilities have been assumed by the Department of Homeland Security. The Committee did not approve funding for the council within the White House Office, believing it should be funded separately. The law provides an appropriation of $7.231 million for the Executive Residence Operation and Care, with proposed increases for maintenance and repair. The Executive Residence Operation and Care appropriation includes funding for maintenance and repair, as well as costs for state functions and political events. Reimbursable political events require advance payment by sponsors, with reimbursements tracked and billed accordingly. The Committees on Appropriations oversee the expenses and recommended the same appropriations as requested by the President. The House and Senate passed a law providing appropriations for repair and restoration funds for the east and west wing exterior, electrical, mechanical, and control system components, and computer servers. The Special Assistance to the President account funds the Vice President's responsibilities, including official travel costs. The Committees on Appropriations recommended and approved the appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended, and the law provides the same appropriation as the President requested for the care and operation of the Vice President's official residence. This includes operating expenses and a gift fund. The Senate committee expects to be informed of any renovations or alterations made to the residence by the Navy. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) was created in 1946 to assist the President in economic policy formulation. It analyzes the national economy, federal programs, and policy to provide economic advice. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $4.5 million appropriation, with the House recommending $4 million. The Office of Policy Development supports the Domestic Policy Council and National Economic Council in advising the President on policy implementation.

The House passed an appropriation of $82.8 million, including funds for the Capital Investment Plan for information technology infrastructure modernization. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $9 million for the Capital Investment Plan for IT modernization within the EOP, $1.6 million less than the President's request. The Senate approved the President's requested amount of $20.578 million for the same purpose. The EOP would submit a report on the Enterprise Architecture to the Committees on Appropriations. The report on Enterprise Architecture, IT Human Capital Plan, capital investment plan, and IT capital planning process would be reviewed by OMB and GAO. The Committee supports the Centralized Procurement Pilot Project but recommends funding for specific items within the EOP offices. The law includes funding for the Capital Investment Plan for IT modernization within the EOP, with $20.578 million available until expended. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) assists the President in budgetary and management responsibilities. OMB's activities include preparing budget documents, reviewing agency programs, and promoting efficient procurement. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $77.4 million for OMB, a 24.9% increase from the previous year. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $62.8 million for OMB, $14.6 million less than the President's request. Savings would be derived from various measures including deferring proposed initiatives, reducing staff years, limiting expenses, and transferring funds back to a pilot project on centralized procurement. The Committee also directs OMB to report on agency competitive sourcing targets within 30 days of establishment. The report directs OMB to detail agency competitive sourcing targets, maintain records of changes, submit a report on federal funds used for professional organizations, involve Appropriations Committees in PART ratings, and manage a $75.4 million appropriation by limiting staff and development growth. The committee report accompanying S. 1589 expresses concerns about agencies shielding data from the Federal Data Quality Act and directs OIRA to update guidelines for transparency. It also supports the Truman Scholarship program and mandates selection of at least one scholar from each state. The law appropriates $67.159 million and provides instructions for OIRA and the implementation of the Federal Data Quality Act. The conferees direct $1,000,000 of funding from the OIRA appropriation to be withheld until programmatic concerns are addressed. They are concerned about agencies not fully complying with the Federal Data Quality Act and emphasize the importance of high-quality data. The Administrator of OIRA is required to submit a report by June 1, 2004 on agencies' responsiveness to public requests for correction of information under the FDQA. The law prohibits the use of funds from OMB for reviewing agricultural marketing orders or altering witness testimonies. It also restricts funds for employees who allocate budget authority. The ONDCP develops policies for the National Drug Control Program and conducts policy research. The National Drug Control Strategy budget for FY2004 was proposed at $27.3 million, with $25.9 million for salaries and expenses and $1.4 million for policy research. The House recommended $28.8 million, the Senate approved $27.997 million, including funding for policy research and the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws.

The FY2004 budget requested $40 million for the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center, with $18 million for counternarcotics research and development projects and $22 million for the technology transfer program. The House and Senate recommended different appropriations, with the Senate approving $42 million, including $24 million for the technology transfer program. The Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC) is funded at $24 million. The Committee expects detailed spending plans for research and development programs and technology transfer programs for fiscal years 2001-2003. The law directs ONDCP to report on funding allocations by December 31, 2003, and requests a specific accounting of grant applications received and awarded in the previous year. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program provides assistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement entities affected by drug trafficking. The President's FY2004 budget proposed $206.4 million, a decrease from the previous year. Funds are disbursed for joint initiatives, with a portion allocated to State and local entities for drug control activities. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $226.350 million for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program, $20 million more than the President's request. The increase is to fully fund existing HIDTA program activities, expand HIDTAs where justified, fund new HIDTAs as appropriate, and support HIDTA activities through the Central Priority Organization Targets (CPOT) initiative. Existing HIDTAs in fiscal year 2003 will receive funding at least equal to the fiscal year 2003 initial allocation level. ONDCP will review candidates for new HIDTA funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $226.350 million for the HIDTA program, $20 million more than the President's request. The additional funding is to fully fund existing HIDTA program activities, expand HIDTAs where warranted, and fund new HIDTAs and activities consistent with the program's mission. No funds will be used for further consolidation of the Southwest Border HIDTA. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $226.350 million for the HIDTA program, $20 million more than the President's request. The additional funding is intended to fully fund existing HIDTA program activities, expand HIDTAs where needed, and support new HIDTAs and activities in line with the program's mission. The funds should not be used to consolidate the Southwest Border HIDTA until a report on its structure is submitted. The Committee expects the funds to be used strictly for implementing the strategy for each HIDTA, without supplanting existing support for drug control operations. Additionally, ONDCP is directed to consult with relevant committees on new grant programs and coordinate with other Federal agencies targeting international drug traffickers. The General Accounting Office is directed to conduct a study on the effectiveness of the CPOT program and its conformity with the HIDTA mission. Committee views on methamphetamine reduction and specific issues in various HIDTAs are also expressed in the report. The law provides funding for HIDTA program activities and directs a certain percentage to be transferred to State and local entities for drug control activities. Up to 49% of the total funding shall remain available until September 30, 2005, and may be transferred to federal agencies. The funding for HIDTA program activities allows for transfers to federal agencies and departments until September 30, 2005. At least $2.1 million is designated for auditing services, with $500,000 allocated for a data collection system. HIDTAs designated by September 30, 2003, will receive funding at FY2003 levels unless changes are justified and approved. The account administered by the ONDCP supports high-priority drug control programs, with funds transferable to drug control agencies or directly obligated by the ONDCP. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $250 million for various drug control programs, including a national media campaign, assistance grants, and research activities. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $230 million, with $150 million allocated for the media campaign. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $230 million for drug control programs, with $150 million allocated for a national media campaign. The committee report encourages exploring alternative media in schools and requests an evaluation plan for the Media Campaign for fiscal years 2004-2008. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $174 million for drug control programs, with $100 million allocated for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. Other allocations include $7.2 million for the United States Anti-Doping Agency, $60 million for the Drug-Free Communities Program, and funding for various other initiatives. The committee also included directives related to the National Media Campaign in their report. The Committee allocated $100 million for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, with concerns about the resources used for outside media consultants. They directed that 80% of the funding be used for advertising unless approved for reprogramming. A study will be conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of using outside consultants and the effectiveness of the ads produced. The Committee is concerned about the matching of ads at different times, directing ONDCP to provide a detailed report on advertising placement. They also want closer scrutiny on matching proposals to ensure they mirror the purchased time and space. The Committee plans to rely on a NIDA study to assess the campaign's impact. $229 million is appropriated, with $145 million for a national media campaign and $70 million for drug-free community grants. The funding allocation for various anti-drug programs includes $3 million for the Community Anti-Drug Coalition Institute, $2 million for Counterdrug Intelligence Executive Secretariat, $1 million for National Drug Court Institute, $7.2 million for United States Anti-Doping Agency, and $800,000 for World Anti-Doping Agency membership dues. The funds can be transferred to other federal agencies. USADA is required to provide expenditure reports and spending plans to the Committees on Appropriations. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign's effectiveness in reducing youth drug use needs to be demonstrated. ONDCP must submit an evaluation plan for the media campaign for FY2004-FY2008 to the Committees on Appropriations. The ONDCP is directed to provide a detailed report on the media campaign to the Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of the Transportation and Treasury appropriations act. The account allows for funds to address unplanned contingencies for national interest, security, or defense purposes, with an appropriation of $1 million proposed for FY2004. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended and provided the same appropriation as requested by the President. The Election Assistance Commission, an independent agency created in FY2004, received an additional $1 billion for election reform grants. The Federal Election Commission administers campaign finance laws and oversees disclosure requirements. The President's fiscal 2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $50.4 million for the FEC. The FEC requested a $50.4 million budget for fiscal year 2004, with a slight increase from the previous year. The agency attributed the stable budget request to efficiency gains from electronic filing and new programs. The House bill maintained the funding level and included provisions to extend the FEC's administrative fines program. The Senate passed a bill to extend the FEC's administrative fines program by two years and allow timely filing of reports by overnight delivery. The conference version of the bill appropriated $51.2 million for the FEC, including $800,000 for interim activities. Conferees included provisions for automated data processing systems and timing of report filing. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, $1 billion was added for the Election Assistance Commission. The Federal Labor Relations Authority serves as a neutral party in settling disputes between unions, employees, and federal agencies. The FLRA has three components: the Authority, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $29.6 million for the FLRA, a 3.0% increase from FY2003. The General Services Administration (GSA) administers federal civilian procurement policies and manages federal buildings, property, and records. The FY2004 budget allocated $56.4 million for government-wide policy and $88.1 million for operating expenses. The FY2004 budget allocated $56.4 million for government-wide policy and $88.1 million for operating expenses. Additionally, there were allocations for the Office of Inspector General, allowances and office staff for former Presidents, and the electronic government fund. The Senate recommended slightly different amounts, while the House provided a total of $56.4 million for government-wide policy and $79.1 million for operating expenses. The President's FY2004 budget included allocations for government-wide policy, operating expenses, the Office of Inspector General, allowances and office staff for former Presidents, interagency electronic government initiatives, and the Federal Buildings Fund.

The President's FY2004 budget included allocations for government-wide policy, operating expenses, the Office of Inspector General, allowances and office staff for former Presidents, interagency electronic government initiatives, and the Federal Buildings Fund. Congress authorized additional funds for new construction, courthouses, repairs, and alterations, including specific allocations for repairs to existing courthouses, a chlorofluorocarbons program, and a glass fragmentation program. An additional $407.0 million was recommended to be deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund, with portions allocated for new construction and repairs. The President's FY2004 budget requested an additional $217.0 million for the Federal Buildings Fund, totaling $6,557.5 million. This included funds for new construction, repairs to existing courthouses, a glass fragmentation program, and a chlorofluorocarbons program. The additional $217.0 million was allocated to the Federal Buildings Fund, bringing the total to $6,579.9 million. $400.6 million was designated for new construction projects, while $1,012.7 million was set aside for repairs and alterations, including specific allocations for courthouse repairs, a glass fragmentation program, and a chlorofluorocarbons program. Additionally, funds were allocated for the Electronic Government Fund, with $3 million approved as a compromise between the Senate and House allocations. In FY2004, the Senate approved $5 million for the e-gov fund, while the House initially recommended $1 million, which was later approved. The fund is administered by the Administrator of General Services to support projects approved by the director of OMB. Funding for the Electronic Government Fund was a contentious matter between the President and Congress in FY2003 and FY2002. The President's proposed budget for FY2002 included a Blueprint for New Beginnings, which aimed to establish an electronic government account with initial funding of $10 million in 2002, growing to $100 million over three years. The fund would support interagency e-gov initiatives, digital signature implementation, and the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. The Bush Administration later doubled the allocation to $20 million for the e-gov fund. The President's FY2002 budget included establishing a $20 million e-gov fund within the General Services Administration. Congress appropriated $5 million for FY2002, with transfers to federal agencies requiring approval from the Committees on Appropriations. The fund aims to support interagency projects for electronic government activities. The administration worked with congressional committees to clarify GSA's role as the operator of the federal portal for citizen access to government services. The President's budget for FY2003 sought $45 million for e-gov initiatives, a significant increase from the previous year, to support 23 high-priority internet services. This funding would also advance the implementation of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. The Administration sought $45 million for e-gov initiatives in FY2003 to support internet services and implement the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. The House recommended $5 million for the fund, while the Senate proposed the full amount. Final funding was provided by P.L. 108-7. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) received $316.3 million in funding, with $256.7 million designated for operating expenses. NARA is responsible for preserving federal records, administering presidential libraries, and providing access to historical materials. The funding also includes support for the preservation of the records of the Freedman's Bureau. $35.9 million recommended for electronic records archive, $13.7 million for repairs and restoration, including $500,000 for Military Personnel Records Center study, $2.25 million for land acquisition in Alaska, and $5 million for plaza repair at Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. $10 million recommended for NHPRC. Senate approved $276.674 million for NARA for FY2004, $29 million less than President's request. Operating expenses proposed at $258.191 million, with $13.483 million for repairs and restoration. The House approved $299.8 million for NARA, slightly less than the President's request but more than the Senate's recommendation. $255.2 million was allocated for operating expenses, with additional funds for electronic records archive and repairs. The President's requested amount for repairs and NHPRC grants program was approved. The President's budget for FY2004 was $305.6 million, seeking increased funding compared to FY2003. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $35.5 million for the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an 11.6% increase from FY2003. The budget includes funds for employee and managerial development opportunities and compliance with the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, Public Law107-289, requires audited financial statements for agencies with over $25,000,000 in appropriated funds. Beginning in fiscal year 2004, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is not requesting funds from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $32.9 million, $2.6 million less than the President's request. Up to $2.6 million for administrative expenses could be transferred from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for retirement appeals adjudication. The conferees agreed to transfer funds from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for retirement appeals adjudication, rather than providing a direct appropriation as requested by the President. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers personnel functions and helps agencies develop human resources management systems. The OPM's Strategic Human Resources Policy Division designs policies linked to agency missions, while the Human Capital Leadership and Merit Systems Accountability Division assists agencies in implementing human capital strategies. The Merit Systems Accountability Division helps agencies with human capital strategies. The Human Resources Products and Services Division supports federal agencies with retirement, insurance, and other HR services. The Office of Inspector General conducts audits and investigations, with a proposed budget of $18.0 billion for OPM in FY2004. In FY2004, trust fund transfers of $135.9 million were allocated for salaries and expenses, with an additional $14.4 million for OIG salaries and expenses. The budget request includes funds for enhanced IT support, e-Government projects, and program evaluation. The OIG budget will finance more audit staff and investigators to reduce the audit cycle and increase recoveries. The OPM budget request for FY2004 is 8.8% more than the previous year's appropriation. The FY2004 budget request for OPM includes $119.498 million for salaries and expenses, which is slightly less than previous appropriations for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funding for specific projects within OPM. The Committee recommended trust fund transfers for salaries and expenses, OIG salaries and expenses, and additional funding for the retirement readiness project with InFRE. OPM is directed to award the funding to InFRE and report on the project's progress within 60 days. The Committee also urges OPM to ensure that any transfer of DSS functions will not impact its current workload and to notify the Committees of any delays in research, audits, or investigations related to PBMs. The Committee directs OPM to conduct a study to determine the number of Federal employees and retirees eligible for FEHBP but not covered by any health insurance program, reasons for lack of coverage, and their agencies and pay grades. Results due by September 30, 2004. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended and passed the same appropriations as requested by the President. $36.7 million would be allocated for automating retirement recordkeeping systems. The Committee expressed disappointment in OPM's lack of cooperation in modernizing its retirement system, directing GAO to assist in the project. The Committee directs GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on problems with the modernization project. The law provides $119.498 million for salaries and expenses. OPM is directed to consider including certain counties in Massachusetts in the Hartford, CT pay area. An amendment by Senator Grassley prohibits funds from being used to implement OPM regulations reducing detailee time in Congress. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The fund aims to reinforce the value of employee performance management systems by providing additional pay based on individual or organizational performance. Ninety percent of funds would be distributed to agencies based on their plans, with the remainder allocated at the discretion of OPM. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended this fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, $497.5 million less than the President's request. Funding is contingent upon legislation authorizing the fund within OPM. The Senate did not pass an appropriation for the fund, believing it should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. The law provides an appropriation of $1 million, with funds not to be obligated until legislation establishes the fund within OPM. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) investigates federal employee allegations of prohibited personnel practices, enforces the Hatch Act, and handles whistle-blowing cases. The President's FY2004 budget proposed $13.5 million for the OSC, a 9.2% increase from FY2003, to reduce case processing backlogs. The OSC requested funding for additional staff to address case processing backlogs. The Appropriations Committees recommended and passed the same appropriation as requested by the President. The report discusses general provisions related to infrastructure policies and specific agencies or programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, contains these provisions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contains general provisions including a 4.1% pay increase for federal white collar employees under the General Schedule. The Administration recommended dropping several provisions, but the Act includes the pay adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2004. Federal white collar employees under the General Schedule receive annual pay adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). In January 2003, the base pay adjustment was 3.1% and the full pay increase was 4.1% for federal civilian personnel. The additional 1% was applied to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed for federal civilian employees. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed for federal civilian employees, with an alternative plan of a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. Congress had not completed action on legislation to establish other rates, and the President's plan went into effect. The FY2004 budget resolution included a provision for civilian and military pay increases to be in parity. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 bill would establish a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees, with the split between basic and locality pay at the President's discretion. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited wage adjustments in high-cost areas to prevent FWS wages from exceeding General Schedule salaries. The Monroney Amendment extended survey application to Department of Defense employees. P.L. 107-117 extended the Monroney Amendment to Department of Defense personnel, changing the salary determination for Senior Executive Service. The new system eliminates the six-tier system, shifts salary setting authority to the Office of Personnel Management, and caps rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule. The minimum pay rate for January 2004 is $103,700, with a maximum of $145,600 for most. Those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can receive up to $158,100. Additionally, a $500 million fund would be established for rewarding top-performing individuals with permanent base pay increases. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, is based on ECI calculations. A 2.2% pay adjustment was scheduled for January 2004, but was limited to 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 was passed. The full adjustment of 2.2% will be retroactive. An amendment to deny the pay increase to Members of Congress was tabled by the Senate in 2003. The pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, is based on ECI calculations. A 2.2% pay adjustment was scheduled for January 2004, but was limited to 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 was passed. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum in 2001 from $200,000 since 1969. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum in 2001 from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to the rate of pay for Cabinet Secretaries (currently $171,900) and the pension is adjusted automatically as those pay rates are changed. The Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs, i.e. through the appropriation of each employing agency. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs, with a surcharge of around 3.5% of benefit costs. The surcharge would be mainly paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration reiterated its support for competitive sourcing and objected to an amendment that could hinder it. The President's senior advisers would recommend a veto if the bill contained a prohibition on funding for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered competitive sourcing provisions in a report that had not been filed yet. These provisions, part of the President's Management Agenda, apply to commercial activities of federal executive agencies. Circular A-76 provides guidance for public-private competitions, and the enacted versions of these provisions are found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199). This section places conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). The requirements of Section 647(a) for streamlined competitions may conflict with Circular A-76, particularly regarding the consideration of the conversion differential. This could impact the competitiveness of in-house cost estimates and meeting the deadline for streamlined competitions. The official would consider whether the cost of contractor performance is less costly to the agency under Section 647(a)(2), with uncertainty on the criteria for comparison. The more stringent requirement for standard competitions is found in the circular, where agencies must add the conversion differential to the cost of non-incumbent performance. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress. Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on their competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions, costs, savings, projected FTEs, and decision-making processes. The reports aim to aid congressional oversight and inform OMB policy, but the lack of a standardized methodology may limit their usefulness and add to competitive sourcing costs. Section 647(c) allows agency heads to issue letters of obligation to MEOs with performance periods longer than five years, potentially reducing the frequency of recompetitions. This could impact government agencies and private sector sources differently. Contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under FAR, while longer performance periods could help with recruitment and retention concerns among federal employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use appropriated funds for competitive sourcing activities. Section 647(e) states that work converted to contractor performance cannot be moved outside the United States if previously done by federal government employees within the country. This provision may impact contractors' ability to bid competitively based on labor costs. It could help retain jobs in the US but may increase costs for some employers. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill dropped provisions on travel restrictions and Cuba-related measures, including remittances and educational exchanges. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolation since the 1960s. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has aimed to isolate the Communist government of Fidel Castro through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and restrictions on financial transactions and travel. Congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996 strengthened these sanctions. Recent controversy surrounds Cuba sanctions, with various proposals in Congress to lift or ease restrictions. The overall objective of U.S. policy towards Cuba is to promote democracy and human rights on the island, but there are differing opinions on how to achieve this goal. Some advocate maximum pressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, others argue for lifting some U.S. sanctions believed to hurt the Cuban people, and some call for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. The House-approved H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel and remittance restrictions, as well as eliminating the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. Restrictions on travel have been a contentious component in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. Certain travelers may go to Cuba under a general license. Certain categories of travelers may travel to Cuba under a general license, including U.S. government officials, journalists, persons with close relatives in Cuba, full-time professionals, and amateur athletes participating in international competitions. Supporters of easing travel restrictions argue it can promote freedom in Cuba, while opponents fear it would financially benefit the Cuban government amidst crackdowns on democracy activists. In March 2003, amendments were made to Cuba travel regulations allowing travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. H.Amdt. 377 aimed to prevent restrictions on remittances, while H.Amdt. 382 sought to maintain people-to-people educational exchanges. Supporters argued for unlimited financial support to Cuban families, while opponents feared money would benefit the Cuban regime. The regulations on educational travel to Cuba were tightened, specifically targeting people-to-people exchanges unrelated to academic coursework. Some groups supported the restrictions, viewing the exchanges as a loophole for unrestricted travel, while others criticized the decision for limiting ordinary people's ability to interact with counterparts on the island. In Senate action, a motion to prevent funds from enforcing Cuba travel restrictions was defeated, with the provision becoming part of the bill. The crackdown on human rights in Cuba in 2003 also played a role in the decision-making process. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 were impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003, with less support compared to previous years. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, lower than a similar amendment in 2002. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31740 and CRS Report RL31139 on Cuba-related legislative initiatives. Administration within the DOT includes various programs such as FHWA, BTS, CG, CMAQ, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, and O&M. The DOT funding sources include dedicated transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget and is part of the discretionary budget. Key programs within the DOT include NMCSA, O&M, FAA, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, and TSA. The Department of Transportation (DOT) funding sources consist of transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and airport and airway trust fund, are funded by specific taxes and accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending in FY2002. Highway and transit funding, supported by contract authority from the highway trust fund, are the largest components of DOT appropriations. Contract authority allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year for obligations without the need for appropriations legislation. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA). The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) changed the role of appropriations committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The RABA mechanism accrues funds to the trust fund from increased revenues, but in FY2003, leaving the RABA adjustment intact would have led to a significant drop in highway obligational funding. TEA-21 limits the discretion of appropriations committees in changing spending levels for specific programs or projects, although some attempts were made in the FY2000 appropriations act to regain some discretion over highway spending. The FY2001 and FY2002 appropriations acts saw significant redistributions of funds among programs, including earmarked projects and additional funding for TEA-21 programs. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21) guaranteed increased spending on aviation programs through new budget rules. Supporters believed this led to significant spending growth in FY2001 and FY2002. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 led to increased spending in transportation programs, with transportation appropriators having control over funding for specific agencies. The budgeting process involves budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing obligational funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Prior to TEA-21, changes in transportation spending were achieved through a combination of budget/contract authority adjustments and limitations on obligations. TEA-21 limited obligations for highway and transit programs, with contract authority providing funding upfront for projects. States pay for projects initially, and federal payments are made later when work is completed. This system reduced the role of appropriations in funding transportation programs. Trust fund balances remain high as funds are committed but not subtracted, covering future obligations. Both highway and transit accounts have short- and long-term commitments, including payments for current projects and outstanding obligations. Apportionments distribute funds to states for formula-driven programs, while allocated funds are distributed administratively. The federal lands highway program allocates funds to federal agencies, states, Indian tribes, or other governmental entities. Recipients may mistakenly assume state apportionments are part of the federal budget."
