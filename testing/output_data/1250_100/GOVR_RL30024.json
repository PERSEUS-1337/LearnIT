    "content": "The U.S. struggles to integrate energy policy with greenhouse gas emissions due to the strong link between industrialization and emissions. In 2008, energy-related activities accounted for 86% of U.S. greenhouse gases. The country has historically used cheap energy to compete internationally, leading to high GHG emissions per capita. Efforts to increase energy efficiency and shift towards natural gas and high-tech industries have helped reduce emissions per unit of output. In the face of economic reality, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased from 6 to 7 billion metric tons between 1990 and 2008. The debate over a GHG reduction program revolves around Cost, Competitiveness, and Comprehensiveness. Cost refers to the monetary estimate of a reduction program, encompassing various economic changes at the program level. The debate over a GHG reduction program revolves around Cost, Competitiveness, and Comprehensiveness. Competitiveness concerns arise at both domestic and international levels, reflecting changes in competitive relationships among producers. Secondary benefits of GHG reductions, like commercialization of breakthrough technologies, are often difficult to quantify. Comprehensiveness in the debating arena involves the global nature of individual national responses to GHG emissions. A \"comprehensive\" GHG reduction requirement would create a level playing field for all nations, but determining comparable requirements is challenging due to diverse resource endowments and economic conditions. The UNFCCC differentiates responsibilities between developed and developing nations. The international community has struggled for almost two decades to develop a fair and effective approach to reducing GHG emissions, with cost often being a key concern. The United States has been involved in GHG policy deliberations since the 1992 ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the US could reduce emissions by 10-40% of 1990 levels at low cost or even net savings with proper policies in place. The US has been involved in GHG policy deliberations since the 1992 ratification of the UNFCCC. The George H. W. Bush Administration refused to commit to binding CO2 emission reductions, citing concerns about scientific uncertainty and competitiveness. The UNFCCC reflects this stance by calling for voluntary control measures. Senate debate highlighted concerns about compliance costs and impact on competitiveness. The UNFCCC set goals for stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent climate interference, with developed countries aiming to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was key for the US response to the UNFCCC. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) was a key statutory basis for the U.S. response to the UNFCCC, with provisions aimed at energy conservation, renewable energy, and addressing global climate change concerns. The George H. W. Bush Administration considered EPACT extremely important in reducing greenhouse gases and implementing energy efficiency measures. EPACT included sections to establish energy-efficiency standards, promote energy-saving information dissemination, and authorize research programs for energy-efficient technologies. Title XVI specifically addressed global warming concerns in energy policy planning. Title XVI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 aimed to incorporate global warming concerns in energy policy planning by collecting, analyzing, and reporting information on climate change through the Department of Energy. It included activities such as developing a least-cost energy strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and creating a Director of Climate Change. The passage of EPACT was expected to result in a substantial reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through programs promoting advanced clean coal and renewable technologies, as well as domestic energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives. EPACT's provisions on electric utilities, alternative fuels, and coalbed methane align closely with the UNFCCC. The act serves as implementing legislation for the U.S. commitment to the UNFCCC. The George H. W. Bush Administration issued the first U.S. plan, National Action Plan for Global Climate Change, in December 1992. The first U.S. plan, National Action Plan for Global Climate Change, focused on estimating greenhouse gas emissions and describing existing activities. These activities included research initiatives, programs from the National Energy Strategy and EPACT, and EPA's pollution prevention initiatives like the \"Green Lights\" program. The plan followed IPCC recommendations for actions on climate change that were economically efficient, served multiple purposes, and could be easily modified. The Climate Change Action Plan, issued by the Clinton Administration in October 1993, aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. It included nearly 50 program activities to achieve this goal, focusing on enhancing existing programs and introducing new voluntary initiatives. The plan projected a minimal increase in emissions compared to a \"business as usual\" scenario. The Clinton Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993, aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 through various initiatives, including enhancing existing programs and introducing new voluntary measures. The plan was not submitted to the UNFCCC but was considered a core component of a future submission. In 1994, a technical supplement was issued to detail the analysis assumptions, and a revised Climate Action Report was submitted in 1997. The plan focused on market choices to conserve energy, increase efficiency, and promote natural gas use, as well as strengthening regulatory standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 1993 Clinton plan aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 through various initiatives, including new programs like the \"Golden Carrot\" program and a renewable energy consortium. Despite projections of emissions returning to 1990 levels, by 1997, emissions were expected to increase by 13% above 1990 levels due to economic growth and lack of full funding from Congress. The plan focused on public-private partnerships to deploy energy-efficient technologies and accelerate innovative technologies. The 1993 Clinton plan aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through new programs and initiatives. The UNFCCC established a conference of parties to negotiate agreements to counter global climate change, with concerns raised about exempting newly industrializing countries from future reduction requirements. At COP-2, ministerial participants signed a declaration for \"legally binding mid-term targets,\" leading to COP-3 in Kyoto in December 1997. The U.S. Senate approved Senate Resolution 98, stating conditions for the U.S. to sign any international agreement on greenhouse gases, including not signing unless developing countries also limit emissions and no harm to the U.S. economy. The Senate's conditions for considering a treaty on greenhouse gases include a cost analysis, concerns about the impact on the U.S. economy and trade, and the need for comprehensive coverage including developing countries. The Kyoto Protocol did not meet these conditions, leading to the U.S. not ratifying it. The Bush administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol due to concerns about its flaws, including exemptions for developing countries, unrealistic targets, and negative economic impacts. President Bush called for a new approach focused on science and market-based incentives to address global climate change while ensuring economic growth and prosperity. The George W. Bush Administration's climate change policy focused on global participation, economic growth, market-based incentives, and technological innovation. Unlike previous administrations, it did not aim to return greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels as outlined in the UNFCCC. The Bush Administration's climate change policy aimed to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 18% in 2012 through a voluntary program. They also formed the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate with six nations to facilitate technology cooperation for practical results. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate aims to achieve practical results in reducing pollution, ensuring energy security, and addressing climate change concerns. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, this partnership involves both developed and developing nations equally and operates on voluntary initiatives to avoid imposing costs. Climate change was not a primary focus during the drafting of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with emphasis placed on energy security and supply instead. In 2003 and 2005, Senate bills proposing mandatory cap-and-trade programs for greenhouse gas reduction were defeated. In the 109th Congress, a Sense of the Senate resolution on climate change was introduced by 13 Senators, emphasizing the need for mandatory steps to address greenhouse gas emissions. The Congress passed a resolution for a national program on greenhouse gases with market-based limits and incentives. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 included debates on climate change but omitted direct initiatives. In the 110th Congress, explicit climate change legislation progressed with the America's Climate Security Act of 2007 being reported out by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. The America's Climate Security Act of 2007 aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade program, but failed to proceed on the Senate floor. Senators Obama and Biden had outlined climate change initiatives, including a pledge to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 and engage in international efforts like the UNFCCC. President Obama's administration shifted directions by appointing key officials focused on climate change, directing EPA to reconsider regulations on carbon dioxide emissions, and passing a bill addressing energy and climate change issues in the House during the first session of the 111th Congress. The Clean Air Act was amended to establish a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions, starting in 2012. The program aimed to reduce emissions by 83% below 2005 levels by 2050 through actual reductions or offsets. The bill also included renewable energy requirements, carbon capture mandates, and GHG emission standards. Senate committee approved a similar cap-and-trade program in November 2009. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported the American Clean Energy Leadership Act (S. 1462) in July 2009, a comprehensive energy policy bill without a mandatory GHG control program. Opponents of climate change legislation focused on potential costs and competitive disadvantages, questioning the effectiveness of cap-and-trade programs in reducing emissions. A cap and trade program creates a market for emitting GHGs by setting a cap on allowances. Emitters can reduce emissions or buy allowances based on economic interest. The total value of allowances in the U.S. program could reach billions of dollars annually. However, debates have misrepresented the actual costs of reducing emissions compared to the value of allowances, leading to inflated cost estimates. This distortion has been used to argue against the program, despite its intended cost-saving benefits. The 2009 Copenhagen Conference aimed to address global climate change by engaging the two largest emitters, the United States and China. Despite initial reluctance from the George W. Bush Administration, President Obama pushed for engagement with China. The conference resulted in a last-minute agreement, showing progress in bridging the gap between developed and developing nations on reducing emissions. The Copenhagen agreement aimed to reduce global emissions to hold the temperature increase below 2 degrees C. Developed nations committed to specific emissions targets for 2020, while developing nations pledged mitigation actions. The accord included reporting and verification procedures and promised $100 billion a year by 2020 for developing countries. Targets were made voluntary to address concerns about controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The United States and China submitted their commitments. The United States aims for a 17% emissions reduction by 2020, with further reductions in subsequent years. China plans to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45% by 2020, increase non-fossil fuel consumption, and expand forest coverage. Both countries' actions are voluntary and aligned with UNFCCC principles. The U.S. ratified the UNFCCC with the assumption of achieving significant emissions reductions at little to no cost. This flexibility was eliminated with the Kyoto Protocol, which imposed mandatory emissions reduction targets. The George W. Bush Administration reversed its pledge to seek CO2 emissions reductions due to concerns about potential costs. The Obama administration is addressing cost issues through efficiency gains, cap and trade, and voluntary goals. Critics argue that technological breakthroughs for low-cost carbon reductions are difficult to confirm, with many energy alternatives still having high costs and limited commercialization. The UNFCCC was ratified during a time when competitiveness issues were focused on Japan and Europe, who have implemented reduction policies. Concerns about U.S. competitiveness have shifted to developing nations like India and China. Legislation in the House and Senate addresses competitiveness by providing financial assistance to firms affected by climate change mandates and imposing requirements on imports from nations without comparable mandates. The UNFCCC was ratified with the assumption that non-Annex I nations would pursue economic development before comprehensive climate change mandates. However, with China surpassing the US as the largest emitter in 2005 and 9 of the top 20 emitters being non-Annex I countries, the need for a comprehensive approach is evident. The promises of financial and technical assistance from Annex I countries have not yielded desired results, leading to a potential need for fundamental changes in the relationship between Annex I and non-Annex I nations. Copenhagen attempted to maintain the twin goals of reducing emissions while allowing nations to set their own reduction targets. The Kyoto Protocol aims to address the failure of developed nations to voluntarily reduce emissions as agreed in the UNFCCC. It allows nations to set their own emissions reduction goals and provides a mechanism for developed nations to fund GHG reduction actions by developing nations. The effectiveness of voluntary programs in reducing GHG emissions and the competitiveness concerns between Annex I and non-Annex I countries remain to be seen. The Kyoto Protocol is currently being implemented, providing experience in reducing emissions through initiatives like the European emissions trading.

The Kyoto Protocol is currently being implemented, providing experience in reducing emissions through initiatives like the European emissions trading scheme. The question is whether the lessons learned will inform a truly global effort beyond 2012, including the outcomes of the Copenhagen agreement and the actions of major emitters like China and the United States in meeting their emission reduction goals. Success may depend on crafting appropriate domestic responses and the attitudes and actions of other major greenhouse gas emitters."
