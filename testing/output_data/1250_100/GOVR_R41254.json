    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 was signed, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. Additionally, $17.8 billion was provided for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. H.R. 1473 incorporated $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's DOD budget, including cuts to various spending categories and major weapons programs. Notable reductions included $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 1473, made cuts to the President's DOD budget but also added funds for various programs including Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research, Israeli missile defense, and Military Career Advancement Account. The bill did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House version of the bill authorized $725.9 billion, $2.7 million less than requested, while the Senate version authorized $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million. The Senate did not act on S. 3454, which would have repealed the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for military service. A compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supporting President Obama's budget request. The enacted H.R. 6523 supported President Obama's position by not adding funds to continue production of the C-17 cargo plane. It authorized a 1.4% increase in basic pay for military personnel and $485 million for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense. The FY2011 budget for the 050 function includes $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees. The Department of Defense requested $548.9 billion for regular operations and $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Additionally, $33 billion was requested for supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs. The requested supplemental funds for war costs in FY2011 would bring the total amount appropriated for FY2010 war costs to $162.6 billion. The budget request reflected a shift in emphasis from operations in Iraq to those in Afghanistan. An additional $655 million was requested for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the devastating earthquake. The FY2011 budget request includes a 3.4% increase in the DOD base budget, amounting to $548.9 billion, and a 1.8% \"real growth\" in purchasing power. Additionally, $719.2 billion is requested for security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010, while non-security agencies would see a 1.5% decrease to $386.4 billion. The FY2011 budget request includes a 3.4% increase in the DOD base budget, totaling $548.9 billion. This would provide a 1.8% increase in real purchasing power after adjusting for inflation. The request continues the upward trend in DOD base budgets since FY1998. Defense Secretary Robert Gates highlighted the need for a 2% real growth rate to fund planned investments through FY2015. Secretary Gates aimed to sustain the current force and budgets by reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually. He acknowledged the challenge of achieving the necessary real growth rates and proposed shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces while cutting spending on administrative and support activities. This approach, known as increasing the \"tooth\" while decreasing the \"tail,\" aims to transfer savings to force structure and modernization. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually, aiming to shift funds to support combat forces and modernization. This approach involves increasing the \"tooth\" and decreasing the \"tail\" within the budget, with measures such as reducing funding for service support contractors, cutting the number of generals and admirals, and eliminating the Joint Forces Command. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually, aiming to shift funds to support combat forces and modernization. This involved reducing the number of senior DOD civilians by 150 over the next two years and eliminating various agencies. Additionally, contracting and acquisition initiatives were introduced to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, with a focus on affordability targets and rewarding contractors for managing programs more efficiently. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the projected budget increases being inadequate given rising costs. Some Members of Congress express concerns about projected budget increases being inadequate due to rising costs. Representative Barney Frank calls for DOD budget reductions by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and scaling back overseas military deployments. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction efforts may lead to cuts in other federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The budget sustains previous initiatives and reflects the strategy outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the shift towards diverse mission readiness for U.S. forces, prioritizing ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. Long-term initiatives include converting one heavy Army brigade combat team (BCT). The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) focuses on converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade using wheeled armored vehicles. It anticipates potential adversaries challenging U.S. forces asymmetrically with unconventional tactics and technologies. The report dismisses the idea of a conflict spectrum and highlights the use of advanced technologies by both terrorist groups and near-peer competitors. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of military operations in cyberspace, calling for enhanced capabilities to defend cyber-networks and collaborate with other agencies for cyber security. It also maintains the goal of being able to win two major regional wars simultaneously while emphasizing flexibility in responding to global threats. The 2010 QDR highlights the need for U.S. forces to handle multiple missions globally, including stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency, and disaster response. It also focuses on countering the \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities of potential adversaries like China and Iran, which could threaten U.S. power projection capabilities. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of U.S. power projection capabilities in Europe, Asia, and other regions, despite the high cost. These capabilities are vulnerable to various attacks, such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and submarines. The QDR suggests countering anti-access strategies by increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for long-range strike forces, missile defense, and offensive electronic attack capabilities. It also reflects an increase in active duty personnel compared to previous years, following a reduction in manpower since the 1990s. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for military personnel, with an increase in Army and Marine Corps end strength. Congress authorized a raise in basic pay and an increase in Basic Allowance for Housing for service members. Military pay increases during the 1980s lagged behind civilian pay hikes. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better paid than 70% of private sector workers. Advocacy groups push for a higher raise to close the pay gap. The FY2011 DOD funding bills addressed legislative initiatives related to President Obama's decision to revise regulations on openly homosexual personnel in the military. Some Members of Congress believe openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and effectiveness. Some critics oppose changing the current policy on openly homosexual personnel in the military, citing concerns about unit cohesion and combat effectiveness. Legislation has been introduced to repeal the 1993 law and replace it with a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. President Obama called for repealing the law in his State of the Union Address, and the DOD launched a study on implementing such a change. Secretary Gates has opposed repeal pending completion of the study, but announced changes in enforcement procedures for the current law. In a letter to President Obama, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The Administration expressed understanding for congressional action on the issue before completion of the current DOD study. The Administration supports congressional legislation to repeal the 'don't ask, don't tell' law, despite ongoing DOD study. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the law unconstitutional, leading to a temporary stay by the Ninth Circuit. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, which has seen its costs double in the past 10 years. The system serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities and clinics. The increase in costs is attributed to factors such as more retirees using TRICARE, increased frequency of beneficiaries using medical services, legislatively mandated benefit increases, and stagnant fees and copayments. The Bush and Obama administrations proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries, but Congress passed legislation to prevent them. Secretary Gates expressed a desire for cost control in the program. The FY2011 budget requested an increase in funding for weapons and equipment procurement. The FY2011 DOD budget increased from $184.9 billion to $189.0 billion, with a higher proportion allocated to procurement (60%) and a lower proportion to R&D (40%). The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program saw a shift in budget allocation, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement in FY2011. The budget request did not include funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate jet engine for the F-35, repeating proposed cuts from previous years. In FY2010, Congress allocated $2.5 billion for 10 C-17s and $465 million for an alternate engine. Questions have been raised about the Army's Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization program, including the controversial Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) design. The program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) and Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component in 2009 due to design strategy concerns. The Army replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program due to design concerns. The GCV was intended to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. The Army cancelled the existing GCV development contract in 2010 and revised the performance specifications before restarting the competition. The Army's Modernization program includes incorporating various technologies like sensors, unmanned vehicles, and a modified FCS command network. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, with plans for a total of 50 new ships in the next five years. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships, falling short of the 313-ship goal. The fleet is projected to grow to 315 ships by FY2020, peak at 320 ships in FY2024, then decline below 313 ships by FY2027. The plan faces challenges in maintaining required levels of attack submarines and cruiser-destroyer forces. The estimated cost of the plan is $15.9 billion per year, but a CBO report suggests it may require $19.0 billion annually. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan falls short of the 313-ship goal, with a projected growth to 315 ships by FY2020. Specific shipbuilding issues discussed include the development of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, SSBN(X)s, with procurement estimated at $6-7 billion each. Concerns arise over the affordability of the long-term shipbuilding program. The Navy faces challenges in ensuring the affordability of its long-term shipbuilding program, particularly with the procurement of 12 SSBN(X)s. This could potentially lead to reductions in procurement rates for other types of Navy ships. Options to reduce costs or mitigate impacts include procuring fewer SSBN(X)s, reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, stretching out the procurement schedule, and exploring alternative funding sources within the Department of Defense budget. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers, resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers, and terminating the CG(X) cruiser program. They plan to build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar. The proposed FY2011 budget requested $228.4 million. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested $228.4 million for the Aegis ballistic missile defense program, aiming to increase the number of BMD-capable Aegis ships. Concerns arise over the growing demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships and potential strain on the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. The Aegis BMD program is mainly funded through the Missile Defense Agency's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes additional funding for BMD-related efforts, with $2,161.6 million requested for the Aegis BMD program and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. Congress faces decisions on approving the development of the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests for the Aegis BMD program, and providing direction to MDA or the Navy. The budget also includes $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy accelerated its timetable for choosing between two designs by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics for the LCS fleet. They planned to select a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and beyond. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition for up to five additional LCSs. Navy officials later sought approval to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team. In early 2009, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps faced concerns about fighter aircraft shortages due to budget constraints. The Air Force projected a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while the Navy anticipated a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The overall affordability of modernizing tactical aircraft was a key issue for Congress, with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter being a focal point for procurement. The F-35 program, being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, is a key part of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans. The program aims to acquire 2,443 JSFs at an estimated cost of over $300 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the program, raising concerns about affordability in the face of constrained DOD resources. The F-35 program faces budget challenges as production rates increase, requiring over $10 billion annually in acquisition funding. The British government plans to reduce their F-35 purchase from 138 to as few as 40 planes. Congress has rejected proposals to develop an alternative engine for the F-35. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program faces budget challenges as production rates increase. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed to terminate the program, which has received approximately $2.5 billion for the alternate engine. Critics argue that termination was driven by immediate budget pressures, while supporters believe single-source engine production contracts are more cost-effective in the long run. The cancellation of the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and efficiency in DOD's acquisition system. Continuing F136 development may affect the F-35 acquisition program and raise issues of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $863.9 million for a new fleet of mid-air refueling. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, with bidding closing on July 9, 2010. Three offerors submitted bids, including Boeing and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS). The bid from a team of Antonov and U.S. Aerospace was excluded for arriving after the deadline. The production location for the new tanker contract was uncertain. U.S. Aerospace's bid was excluded for being late, and the GAO denied their protest. The contract was awarded to Boeing, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision. The KC-X acquisition program has been of interest due to its value, job creation, and importance to military operations. The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is crucial for the new competition. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system with the Phased Adaptive Approach. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system with the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA), deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for PAA programs, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for Aegis ship-borne BMD system development and procurement. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a 20% reduction, mainly due to decreased funding for BRAC-related construction. The FY2011 DOD budget saw a decrease in military family housing funding, with a shift towards privatizing military housing. The budget also included provisions for Members of Congress opposed to the Navy's plan to move to Mayport, FL. The final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorsed the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second homeport for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) supports the Navy's plan to establish Mayport, Florida as a second homeport for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. This move would require the construction of specialized nuclear support facilities and would shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Some Members of Congress from Florida endorse the proposal, citing benefits in mitigating risks to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs. The estimated cost of moving a CVN to Mayport is $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. The FY2010 DOD budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. Additional military personnel will also be relocated to Guam by 2014-2016. Guam, with a population of about 178,000, will see a permanent increase due to the influx of personnel. The planned influx of military personnel, families, DOD personnel, and contractors to Guam could increase the population by up to 56,000. Analysts also estimate that 25,000 temporary workers may be needed for construction. Concerns have been raised about the island's infrastructure supporting this population surge. The U.S. Cyber Command was created to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. The reorganization of cyber forces began in 2008 under Secretary Gates. The U.S. Cyber Command was established to centralize command of DOD networks for offensive and defensive cyber operations. Some concerns have been raised about the militarization of cyberspace and potential privacy issues with NSA involvement. The new command aims to better organize DOD cyber practices and operations, focusing on defending DOD networks and providing support for civil authorities upon request. The FY2011 DOD budget request included $139 million for U.S. Cyber Command, with plans to set up temporary facilities at Ft. Meade, MD. The budget also reflected a shift in roles between DOD and the State Department for foreign assistance programs. The FY2011 NDAA legislation excluded two DOD-funded programs, now requested under the State Department budget: the \"Section 1207\" crisis reaction program and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. In FY2012, the State Department will take over Iraq police training. The DOD budget request for FY2011 includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF) for Iraqi police training, while the State Department also includes police support funding for the FY2011 transition year. The Administration is reviewing the division of security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming this review for enhancing U.S. security assistance. Pentagon officials have indicated a desire for DOD to maintain or expand its role in security assistance. In a speech on February 24, 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces. This aligns with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report to strengthen the capability of all armed services in training and advising partner nations' security forces. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen also highlighted the need for military power to be considered as a first option, along with diplomacy and other national power instruments. Lawmakers were urged to enhance civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery. The Administration's FY2011 DOD budget request emphasizes the importance of a new relationship between defense and diplomacy, with a focus on complementing each other in international relations. The budget includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the \"Section 1206\" program, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, Defense Institution Reform Initiative, and Stability Operations Fellowship Program. Congress has previously rejected the proposal for the Stability Operations Fellowship Program. In his February speech, Secretary Gates criticized the outdated national security system and proposed a pooled fund for security assistance. The House and Senate versions of the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act differ from the Administration's request for funding. The Senate rejected a bill that would have repealed the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for openly homosexual individuals in the military. A compromise version of the bill was passed without this provision and signed into law in January 2011. The bill authorized lump-sum totals for appropriations but did not include specific funding tables. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 5136, S. 3454, and H.R. 6523 (P.L. 111-383) authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the armed services, with a 7,400 increase over FY2010. The final bill included a 1.4% increase in military basic pay, while the House-passed bill proposed a 1.9% raise. Provisions for increased monthly allowances for separated married personnel and those at risk of hostile fire were not included in the final bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining qualified individuals in essential specialties. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining qualified individuals in essential specialties. Representative Patrick Murphy proposed a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, pending completion of the current DOD review and certification from key officials. The provision was included in the House bill as Section 536 and a similar provision was added to S. 3454 by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator John McCain argued against Senate action on the bill, stating that DOD had not yet completed its review. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a bill that would have repealed the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The final version of the bill did not include provisions for repealing laws on military facility abortion restrictions or authorizing a pilot program for officers' mid-career educational programs. The final version of the bill includes provisions from a DOD commission report on sexual assault in the military, establishing the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, improved medical care protocols for assault victims, and access to victim advocates. It also allows participants to broaden their experience by skipping some promotion requirements and committing to longer service. H.R. 6523, the final version of the bill, includes provisions for sexual assault victims in the military, such as establishing the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office and improving medical care protocols. It does not guarantee confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates or provide legal assistance, but it does require the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of victims receiving assistance from military legal counsel. The bill authorizes the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program, without increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. The enacted version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions for TRICARE beneficiaries to extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26, similar to private health insurance programs. It does not include a House provision for a unified medical command but includes a modified provision for training programs for officers in the services' medical corps. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock, AR, where service members and DOD civilians were killed or wounded in terrorist attacks. The House provision not included in the final bill would have provided special compensation and required the Secretary of Defense to earmark funds for implementing recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident. The House and Senate bills supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, including defense against Iran's ballistic missile attacks. Both bills authorized slightly more than $10.3 billion for missile defense, with additional funding for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The final bill did not allocate specific funding for missile defense programs. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. It also includes restrictions on the PAA similar to those previously applied to the Bush administration's missile defense plan. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for programs associated with the PAA, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. Some Russian sources have raised concerns that the plan could undermine the New START treaty. The final version of the bill places restrictions on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for missile defense in Europe, similar to those applied to the Bush administration's plan. It limits deployment until technology is proven effective and host governments ratify agreements. The Secretary of Defense can waive restrictions for national security. The bill also authorizes a shared missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the authorization bill includes statements regarding missile defense, such as the development of interceptors for Iranian ICBMs and the importance of not diminishing strategic stability with Russia. It does not include provisions from the House bill that would have restricted U.S. nuclear weapons reductions or criticized the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review. The final version of the authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for various ships like DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, Virginia-class attack submarines, Littoral Combat Ships, and aircraft carriers like U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford and U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Incremental funding has become the norm for expensive ships in recent years. Funding for very expensive ships like aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships has become common in recent years. While the congressional appropriations process typically requires full cost budgeting in one year, there are exceptions for incremental funding. H.R. 6523 allows for funding of a helicopter carrier over two years and includes provisions for large amphibious assault ships. The bill also addresses the Navy's shipbuilding requirements in relation to the use of Aegis anti-missile systems on cruisers and destroyers for regional ballistic missile defense. The House-passed bill included provisions to prevent fleet size decline, such as blocking retirement of helicopter carriers until replacements are in service and limiting ship retirements until fleet reaches 313 ships. The Senate committee found Navy's shipbuilding schedule overly optimistic and directed assessments on impact of ship plans on Marine Corps amphibious operations. Leaders agree 38 amphibious landing ships ideal for two brigade-sized assaults, but Navy plans for 33 ships. The Senate committee expressed concerns about cost increases and construction delays potentially hindering the Navy's goal of having 33 amphibious ships. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with the new, expensive SSBN(X) submarines. These new submarines are expected to consume a significant portion of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016, possibly impacting the construction of other planned ships. The bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying funding for specific programs. The final FY2011 defense authorization bill did not authorize funds to continue production of the C-17 wide-body cargo jet, despite previous budget additions for it. The bill included provisions addressing cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and required DOD to create a detailed progress assessment plan. The bill did not limit the number of F-35s procured in FY2011 until certain milestones were met. The final FY2011 defense authorization bill did not authorize funds for the C-17 cargo jet. Both House and Senate versions of the bill approved $11 billion for the F-35 aircraft and rejected funding for an additional plane. The House bill included $485 million for an alternate jet engine, while the Senate bill did not. The final bill did not take a specific stance on the additional funding. The final FY2011 defense authorization bill did not authorize funds for the C-17 cargo jet. Both House and Senate versions approved $11 billion for the F-35 aircraft and rejected funding for an additional plane. The House bill included $485 million for an alternate jet engine, while the Senate bill did not. Secretary Gates reaffirmed his intention to recommend a veto if the alternate engine was funded, citing concerns about disrupting the F-35 program and reducing the number of planes purchased. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees expressed concerns about delays in the F-35 program leading to a drop in carrier-borne fighters, proposing additional funding for F/A-18E/F model fighters to bridge the \"strike fighter gap.\" The enacted bill does not specify the number of F/A-18E/F model fighters authorized. It includes a provision for the Navy to report on addressing the strike fighter gap. $863.9 million is authorized for the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker development. An amendment requires DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in tanker bids. The amendment aimed to address unfair competitive advantages in tanker bids, specifically targeting France-based EADS for receiving government subsidies. Despite support from various House Members, the provision was not included in the final bill. DOD selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision. Both the House-passed and Senate committee-recommended versions denied authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, following the termination of the Future Combat Systems program in 2009. The House and Senate committee versions of the authorization bill denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight missile program. The House bill cut an additional $347.4 million from the Army's BCT Modernization request, while the Senate committee cut only $29.7 million. The authorization did not specify funding for the BCT program but authorized $934.4 million for the Ground Combat Vehicles. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less technologically ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program. The House Armed Services Committee included a provision in the bill to allow the Army to spend only half of the FY2011 GCV appropriation until a detailed analysis of the new fleet of vehicles is provided. DOD reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million. The enacted version of the bill fully funds the Administration's adjusted request. The House provision to bar funds for planning structures at Naval Station Mayport for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was not included. The House committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport. The House committee directed the Navy to report on the cost and benefits of various options for using the Mayport naval facilities. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, with reductions in funds for Marine Corps units redeployment and construction projects. The final bill approved funds for Guam's harbor improvements but denied funding for a Marine base and aviation facilities. It also did not authorize funds to replace Guam's military hospital. Additionally, it approved funds for Air Force projects and a National Guard Readiness Center. H.R. 6523 did not include a House provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds to Guam for increased municipal services. It requires reports on military facilities and civil infrastructure improvements. The bill prohibits transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without certain conditions being met. The final version of H.R. 6523 waives restrictions on detainee transfers if ordered by a court or military tribunal. It also prohibits using funds to build facilities for Guantanamo detainees elsewhere and requires a report on transfer costs. The bill increases funding for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program and extends its authorization. The House bill increased the funding ceiling to $500 million and extended authorization for the program through FY2012. It also required DOD to transfer $75 million to the Secretary of State for building counterterrorism forces in Yemen. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The provision expanded the scope of the Section 1206 program to support police agencies oriented toward domestic law enforcement. The Senate committee-reported bill did not increase the $350 million cap on Section 1206. The Senate committee-reported bill did not increase the $350 million cap on Section 1206 funding but authorized an additional $75 million for Yemeni Interior Ministry units for counterterrorism operations. The final version of the authorization bill also allows the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds for the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan. The Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan aims to link US military operations with economic elements to enhance stability and restore economic normalcy in Afghanistan. H.R. 6523 includes provisions on cybersecurity, directing the Secretary of Defense to report on cyber warfare policy and develop an acquisition process for cyberspace. The final version of the authorization bill requires continuous monitoring of DOD computer networks for security and FISMA compliance, annual reports to Congress on cyber attack damages and U.S. cyberwar capabilities, and did not include a provision for a National Office for Cyberspace. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution. The House and Senate set spending caps for FY2011 through different procedures. The House allocated $523.9 billion for Defense Subcommittee, $7 billion less than requested. The Senate set a ceiling of $522.8 billion, $8.1 billion less than the President's request. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill with a total of $671.0 billion, including $513.3 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill with a total of $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill totaling $671.0 billion, with $513.3 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill totaling $669.9 billion, with $512.2 billion for the base budget. The House passed a bill (H.R. 1) to fund federal agencies through FY2011, including $505.2 billion for base budget programs. The Senate debated H.R. 1 but laid it aside after failing to close debate. The Senate rejected an alternative funding measure by a vote of 42-58, offered by Senator Inouye, which would have provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs. The President signed an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011, incorporating a detailed DOD appropriations bill similar to Inouye's provisions. The enacted bill provided $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs, representing a $20.1 billion reduction from the President's request. The DOD appropriations bill incorporated $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request, including cuts to prior year funds, Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research and Development, civilian pay, and FFRDCs. H.R. 1473 also added funds to the request in 226 instances, offsetting some of the cuts. Congressional earmarks in defense appropriations bills have decreased over the years. The FY2010 bill added significant amounts to the budget request, including funding for Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard and reserve components, medical research programs, and Israeli missile defense systems. It also allocated funds for innovative research and procurement projects but did not continue development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill funded a 1.4% military pay raise and added money for Military Career Advancement Accounts. The Senate committee bill added $162 million for Military Career Advancement Accounts (MyCAA) and $447.0 million for the Defense Health Program (DHP). It included increases for research programs focused on breast cancer, psychological health, and prostate cancer, while cutting funds for THAAD missile deployment. Additionally, $205 million was allocated to accelerate production of the Israeli Iron Dome system. President Obama requested funds for Iron Dome in FY2011, not included in the original DOD budget. H.R. 1473 provided $15.4 billion for Navy shipbuilding, with minor reductions. The bill reduced $1.38 billion for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and $325.0 million for mid-air refueling tanker development. The winning firm was unlikely to spend the budgeted amount due to a delay in choosing between bidders. The bill denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight Missile and cut funds for the Ground Combat Vehicle program. The Army cancelled the NLOS Missile program and restarted the GCV competition in FY2011."
