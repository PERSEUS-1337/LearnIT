Section 11320.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to specify the employment-related activities required of aid recipients, including orientation, job search, family stabilization, education programs, and support services for substance abuse, mental health, or domestic violence. The recipient will be referred to assessment if employment is not found or job search is not likely to lead to employment. A welfare-to-work plan will be developed specifying assigned activities and supportive services. Recipients who have signed a plan must participate in work activities. The welfare-to-work plan includes activities such as unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, subsidized public sector employment, work experience, on-the-job training, and unpaid work experience limited to 12 months. The county welfare department reviews and revises work experience assignments as needed to prepare participants for employment. Grant-based on-the-job training allows for cash grant diversion to the employer as a wage subsidy, with participant agreement required. Information on job termination, Earned Income Tax Credit, and CalFresh benefits is included in the agreement form. The subparagraph becomes operative based on current federal law and IRS regulations. Financial supports should increase current income and future social security income. Grant-based on-the-job training includes community service positions. Wages funded by cash grant diversion are not exempt from income calculation. Supported work includes cash grant diversion for wages. Other forms of employment include workstudy, self-employment, and community service. The program offers various opportunities for participants, including adult basic education, job skills training, vocational education, job search assistance, and education related to employment. The program offers education related to employment, mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence services necessary for employment, and other activities to assist in obtaining unsubsidized employment. Participants must participate in welfare-to-work activities unless exempt. After 24 months of participating in welfare-to-work activities, an aided adult must engage in unsubsidized employment or subsidized private sector employment as part of their welfare-to-work plan.

The welfare-to-work program offers various options for participants after 24 months, including unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, public sector employment, work experience, on-the-job training, job search assistance, community service programs, vocational education training, job skills training, education related to employment, and child care services for those in community service programs.

The notice must be given at application, annual review, after 18 months, and before the 21st month towards the limit. The adult recipient must meet requirements outlined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) to remain eligible for aid. They can dispute the number of months counted towards the 24-month limit and modify their welfare-to-work plan. Exemptions or extensions to the time limit are possible. If requirements are not met, specific provisions apply without being labeled as sanctions. The department will convene a workgroup to determine details of the 24-month time limit requirements and may make recommendations for refining procedures. An assistance unit with an eligible adult can continue in a welfare-to-work plan for up to 24 months, starting from January 1, 2013, unless they exceed the 48-month limit. Section 11325.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows recipients without a high school diploma to participate in a high school equivalency program.
