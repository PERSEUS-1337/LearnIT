    "content": "Federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs are subject to periodic reauthorization. The most recent authorization before SAFETEA was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. Short-term extensions created uncertainty in funding, leading to the consensus that long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are better for planning highway and transit infrastructure. SAFETEA was welcomed by the transportation community, despite delays, as it provided funding until FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund, which consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources are gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, with fuel taxes providing about 90% of the income. The trust fund has seen several tax increases over its almost 50-year lifespan, with the last increase in 1993. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. The trust funds have historically collected more tax revenues than expended, but this trend is changing. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. Despite a substantial unexpended balance, there is uncertainty about the trust fund's long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional future income by changing federal gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion per year starting in FY2005. Reauthorization legislation was passed by both the House and Senate in the 2nd Session of the 108th Congress. The Conference Committee in the 2nd Session of the 108th Congress could not agree on total program funding for the next reauthorization period. Some Members of Congress wanted more project funding than the Bush Administration supported, due to concerns about the trust funds' future health and opposition to raising fuel taxes. Various mechanisms, including gasohol changes and tax adjustments, were proposed to increase program funding. Conferees considered several revenue-increasing provisions, some of which were included in the finance title of the act. The finance title of the act includes provisions for modest revenue increases, mainly from cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. It was believed that these changes, combined with gasohol legislation and expected economic growth, would be enough to finance the $286.4 billion program. TEA-21 altered the highway trust fund's relationship to the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting limitations on obligations. It also introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust funding amounts. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) was introduced in TEA-21 to adjust funding amounts in the highway account based on generated revenues. This set predetermined levels of funding for core highway and transit programs, creating \"firewalls\" to prevent funds from being used for other purposes. Additional funds could be allocated through the annual appropriations process, but this rarely occurred except in FY2003. SAFETEA has maintained these provisions. SAFETEA has largely retained the budget format introduced in TEA-21, with most of the debate revolving around money distribution. It provides a significant increase in funding, with $286.4 billion guaranteed for FY2004-FY2009 compared to $218 billion in TEA-21 for FY1998-2003. SAFETEA represents a boost for federal surface transportation programs, though not as much as originally hoped for. It offers over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2005-FY2009, benefiting all major programs affected by the legislation. The legislation receives significant new funding, with total annual spending increases each year. Funding details for major programs can be found in the report's appendix. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision for Congress to reconsider funding at a later date, which was opposed by the Bush Administration. TEA-21 created a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue changes. RABA provided significant funding in its first three years. The RABA computation in FY2003 called for a program reduction, but Congress chose to increase spending instead. This led to a push to change how RABA was calculated to reduce revenue swings. SAFETEA changed the calculation to a two-year basis and delayed it until FY2007, with spending reductions only if the highway trust fund balance falls below $6 billion. Transportation policy battles often align regionally rather than along party lines, especially regarding the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Some states have complained about receiving less federal highway aid than they contribute in taxes, pushing for a higher share rate-of-return, while other states oppose any reduction in their existing shares. Donor states argue for equity, stating they have been subsidizing the repair of infrastructure in donee states for too long. They also argue they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending as much as some donee states. Southern and western donor states argue that their fast growth areas have needs as great or greater than donee states, and that the completion of the Interstate Highway System eliminates the rationale for the donor-donee disparity. Donee state advocates emphasize the age of their infrastructure, high costs of working on congested urban roads, and limited financial resources in large western states to justify their donee status. They also argue for federal funding based on national needs rather than state boundaries, criticizing Midwestern and southern states for spending less on highways and pleading for federal funds without contributing their own resources. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications for overarching issues. The debate over equity remedies in transportation funding has implications for federal-state roles and funding allocation. Issues include the impact of a 95% rate of return guarantee on addressing other transportation needs, the potential shift towards a revenue sharing or block grant program, and the inclusion of Federal Transit Administration programs in the Minimum Guarantee. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands with limited Highway Trust Fund revenue. The previous debate over equity remedies in transportation funding had implications for federal-state roles and funding allocation. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands with limited Highway Trust Fund revenue. To overcome obstacles, previous reauthorization bills included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. This required increasing the federal highway program size significantly to bring donor state shares up to a designated percentage. Providing equity remedies in this way was costly, resulting in the largest highway program under TEA21. Ultimately, SAFETEA replaced the previous program with a modest and gradual increase in the guaranteed rate-of-return to the states. SAFETEA replaces the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program, ensuring states receive a guaranteed rate-of-return of 90.5% for FY2005-2006, 91.5% for FY2007, and 92% for FY2008-2009. The act includes various programs subject to the equity provision and introduces new formula programs. Hold harmless provisions are also included in the EB program. The EB program includes hold harmless provisions for certain states based on criteria such as population density, income, fatality rate on highways, and fuel tax rate. Twenty-seven states qualify under these criteria. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees that no state may receive less than a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments. Annual percentage floors are set for each fiscal year. The programmatic distribution of funds prioritizes certain programs and distributes any excess funds based on program apportionments. Over the five-year SAFETEA life, the EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. (CRS contacts: Robert Kirk and John Fischer) SAFETEA apportions funds to states annually for various programs, known as \"apportioned\" or formula programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was allocated to five core programs, which SAFETEA increased to six: IM, NHS, STP, HBRR, CMAQ, and HSIP. The EB program, replacing the TEA-21 minimum guarantee, is also considered a core program. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core highway programs. SAFETEA includes additional apportioned programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. It introduces two new formula programs: Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). Funding distribution is based on various factors such as lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and state share of total cost for deficient bridges or non-attainment area population under the Clean Air Act. SAFETEA made adjustments to existing program formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and creating a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction. It also adjusted the calculation for weighted non-attainment areas under CMAQ and set new funding levels for the Territorial Highway Program and off-system bridge program. The formula distribution is based on federal lane miles and total lane miles of federal-aid highways in each state. The SAFETEA act made adjustments to existing program formulas, including changes to the Railway-Highway Crossings program funding distribution. It also required states to set aside $90 million annually for high-risk rural road improvements from HSIP funds. Under TEA-21, this was a discretionary program, but SAFETEA made it mandatory. Under SAFETEA, funds are apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific formulas. This includes allocations for commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, incoming cargo weight, and the number of ports-of-entry. States receive apportionments based on student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with a minimum of $1 million per state. Highway programs not apportioned are subject to allocations based on criteria in highway authorization and appropriation law. The allocated programs in SAFETEA are based on criteria in highway laws and may be subject to congressional earmarking. These programs include high priority projects, federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, bridge discretionary program, and transportation and community system pilot preservation program. SAFETEA also introduces new programs like transportation improvement program, national corridor infrastructure program, and projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The SAFETEA act introduces innovative financing mechanisms for highway projects, including GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs. It provides federal financial assistance through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit. The act makes changes to TIFIA and the SIB program, aiming to speed up project completion and leverage additional funds. SAFETEA introduces new financing mechanisms for transportation projects, including secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit. It reduces project size thresholds and provides funding for TIFIA's leveraging activities. The act allows any state to establish SIBs with federal funds and consolidates tolling provisions. It authorizes tolling programs and HOV lane tolling, with funding allocated for tolling projects. The SAFETEA act authorizes funding for tolling projects, with $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. $3 million is allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects each year. The program directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects for toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or expand highways. Funding is mainly for HOT lanes, with restrictions on revenue use for debt service and operating costs. The SAFETEA act authorizes funding for tolling projects, with $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. The program allows toll facilities to set variable toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. A pilot toll program permits states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes, with fees collected electronically. The SAFETEA act authorizes funding for tolling projects, allowing toll facilities to set variable toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels. States are prohibited from entering agreements that prevent improving public roads adjacent to toll facilities. Revenues from tolls can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and maintenance costs. Interstate Maintenance program funds cannot be used on toll facilities. State agencies can allow non-HOV vehicles to pay tolls for HOV lane use. The SAFETEA act authorizes funding for tolling projects, allowing toll facilities to set variable toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels. It also allows for the tolling of \"low emission and energy-efficient vehicles\" at a preferential rate for HOV use. Additionally, the act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. This enables state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds for the construction of such facilities. The SAFETEA act authorizes funding for tolling projects, allowing toll facilities to set variable toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels. It also allows for the tolling of \"low emission and energy-efficient vehicles\" at a preferential rate for HOV use. Additionally, tax-exempt private activity bonds can finance highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities, with a $15 billion limit on bond issuance. The bonding provision could have a substantial impact on infrastructure development. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) aims to break regional isolation and promote economic development in Appalachia, funded through the highway trust fund. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) is funded through the highway trust fund and aims to break regional isolation and promote economic development in Appalachia. Funds are apportioned to member states based on their \"cost to complete\" estimates of the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). The program received $450 million in contract authority annually under TEA-21 and $470 million annually under SAFETEA. Earmarking in SAFETEA is significantly larger than in TEA-21, with at least 5,092 separate earmarks for high priority projects. The SAFETEA Act contains over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects worth $14.8 billion, including new categories for national and regional projects, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation improvements totaling over $6.2 billion. The SAFETEA Act includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects totaling $14.8 billion. These earmarks are spread across various categories and programs, with a significant amount of funding allocated to specific projects in different titles of the bill. The total amount of earmarking in the bill is estimated to exceed $24 billion, with discussions focusing on how earmarks impact the Equity Bonus calculation. The bill includes earmarks for high priority projects, with discussions on how earmarking affects the Equity Bonus calculation. Earmarks are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line\" for EB purposes, impacting state shares. Transit earmarks are not included in the calculation, while the TE program funds various project categories. The Transportation Enhancement (TE) program funds various project categories such as scenic beautification, historic preservation, rehabilitation of historic transportation buildings, and environmental mitigation. Funding for TE activities is now set at 10% of funds apportioned to a state under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) or the amount apportioned in FY2005, ensuring additional funding for enhancement projects. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program assists in planning and implementing strategies for transportation integration. The TCSP program, authorized under SAFETEA, aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans. It provides funding for projects to improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and encourage compatible private sector development patterns. Eligible entities include state, tribal, regional, and local governments. The program has a six-year total funding authorization of $270 million, with varying amounts authorized for different fiscal years. Under TEA-21, TCSP funding was authorized at $20 million for FY1999 and $25 million per year for FY2000 through FY2003. Funding amounts varied each year, with SAFETEA continuing to provide significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs. The Transportation Enhancements program supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility by allowing states to allocate funds for facilities, safety activities, and preservation of railway corridors. The Transportation Enhancements program supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility by allowing states to allocate funds for facilities, safety activities, and preservation of railway corridors. The Safe Routes to School Program, funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, encourages children to walk and bike to school, promoting a healthy lifestyle from an early age. The Safe Routes to School Program allocates funds to states based on student enrollment ratios, with a minimum of $1 million per state per year. The federal share of project costs is 100%, and funds are available until expended. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for infrastructure projects to improve walking and biking to school. The Safe Routes to School Program funds infrastructure projects to improve walking and biking to school, including sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossing improvements, and secure bike parking. States can also use funds for non-infrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and coordinator positions for safe routes to school programs. The Safe Routes to School Program provides funding for infrastructure projects to improve walking and biking to school. The program also includes grants for a national nonprofit organization to operate a clearinghouse, develop educational programs, and provide technical assistance. Additionally, SAFETEA guarantees $45.3 billion in transit funding for the five-year authorization period, with a 46% increase over the previous funding levels. The share of transit funding for Urbanized Area Formula Program decreased from 47.9% to 44.0%, while the Non-Urbanized Formula Program increased from 3.3% to 5.2%. Funding distribution among states shifted, with larger states receiving less and smaller states receiving more. The federal transit program structure saw minor changes, including new programs, funding categories, and modifications to existing programs. Additional provisions included offering transit passes as a fringe benefit and earmarks for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program and earmarks for FY2006-FY2007 provide $1.7 billion in additional funding to urban and rural areas. Funds are distributed based on population forecasts and population densities. The program aims to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities, including job-related transportation. The program authorized at $339 million over FY2006-FY2009 provides transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, exempt from labor protection provisions. Another program with $97 million authorization aims to provide access to these areas for everyone, including persons with disabilities. Additionally, a new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program, funded by a one-percent set-aside, provides extra funding for small urbanized areas with comparable transit service levels. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program aims to address funding disparities for small areas providing higher levels of transit service. Section 3033 of TEA-21 directed DOT to study the issue and consider changes to reward transit-intensive areas. This change will have a positive impact on funding allocation for these areas. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program aims to address funding disparities for small areas providing higher levels of transit service by shifting approximately 1% of funding from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000 in population. This program is a new category within the New Starts program, with streamlined evaluation processes for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. Additionally, $45 million was allocated for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on Indian reservations. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. The program is intended to be administered as a new program, not a continuation of any previous program. The act also reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, expanding eligible expenses from \"planning\" to \"development\" of high-speed rail. The Swift Rail Act authorizes funding for high-speed rail corridor development and technology improvements. It also allocates funds for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards and grants for the Alaska Railroad. Additionally, the act requires the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a program for rail joint bar inspection data review. The Swift Rail Act authorizes funding for high-speed rail corridor development and technology improvements, as well as the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards. It also requires the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a program for rail joint bar inspection data review. Additionally, the act directs FRA to improve crack identification in rail joint bars and develop regulations for pressurized tank cars. SAFETEA authorizes the Highway Safety Improvement Program, which replaces the roadway hazard elimination program and focuses on installing barriers and guard rails. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) authorizes funding for hazard elimination, with $1.2 billion in FY2006 rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009. Funding is apportioned based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. $220 million annually is reserved for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination, and $90 million for high-risk rural roads projects. States must spend at least $317 million annually on hazard elimination, with the remainder available for other highway projects if not needed for safety improvements. The Safe Routes to Schools program allocates funds for infrastructure projects near schools to enhance children's safety while walking or biking. States can redirect funds from safety projects on grade crossings or high-risk rural roads if safety needs are met. Additionally, a grant program is established to promote seat belt use, with funding increasing from $54 million in FY2005 to $183 million in FY2009. The program authorizes grants for states with primary seat belt laws or high seat belt use rates. Grants can be used for highway safety purposes with 100% federal funding. The program also expands grants to reduce alcohol-impaired driving rates, requiring states to implement specific programs to qualify for funding. The program authorizes grants for states to implement various measures to reduce alcohol-impaired driving rates, including saturation patrols, increased blood alcohol testing, harsher penalties for high BAC levels, rehabilitation programs, prevention strategies for underage drinking, and funding for community programs. Grants can also be used for administrative license revocation systems and returning fines to communities. The total authorization for the program is $555 million over the authorization period. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act includes new programs such as a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for child restraints. It also directs the Department of Transportation to establish standards for reducing vehicle rollover crashes and enhancing passenger motor vehicle occupant protection. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are used to improve performance and safety in highway or transit projects by providing real-time traffic information. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act includes new programs for motorcyclist safety and child restraints. It also directs the Department of Transportation to establish standards for reducing vehicle rollover crashes and enhancing passenger protection. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) provide real-time traffic information to improve performance and safety in highway or transit projects. The act allocates funds for ITS research and deployment, with a focus on advancing new technologies, improving standards, and conducting training. Activities in research and technology development play a crucial role in addressing challenges faced by the nation's surface transportation systems, such as congestion, security, and environmental degradation. The federal government, through agencies like FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA, aims to advance the use of safer technologies and infrastructure to mitigate these challenges. FHWA administers a significant research and technology development program, with an annual budget of approximately $295 million authorized by Title V of SAFETEA. SAFETEA authorizes significant funding for transportation research and education, including $169.4 million for surface transportation research, $26.7 million for training and education, $27 million for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and $69.7 million for the University Transportation Research Program. Research funds are used to improve highway infrastructure and safety, with state and industry experts emphasizing the importance of these funds for maximizing the effective use of federal aid. Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts in freight rail transportation. Congress is considering assisting freight railroads in expanding their infrastructure to handle increasing trade volumes and alleviate highway congestion. Another issue is the impact of more frequent freight train traffic on towns and neighborhoods, leading to delays at grade crossings. Despite reducing railway miles, railroads are intensifying track usage for operational efficiency. Congressional discussions on assisting railroads have been ongoing since the industry's price deregulation in 1980. The captive shipper question has been a congressional issue since rail industry deregulation in 1980. Concerns include high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. SAFETEA addresses these issues in title IX, with a request for a report on rail system performance and funding mechanisms for track rehabilitation. The RRIF Program under SAFETEA expands to $35 billion in total value of available loans, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. Loans must be provided within 90 days without requiring collateral. Loans can be issued for constructing rail connections and enhancing rail infrastructure capacity. The SAFETEA program includes funding for enhancing rail infrastructure capacity, relocating rail tracks, and eliminating grade crossings in various regions across the United States. This program authorizes grants totaling $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009, with specific allocations for projects of national and regional significance such as improving rail connections in Virginia, planning a freight rail tunnel in New York, and eliminating grade crossings in Chicago and Los Angeles. The SAFETEA program allocates funding for rail infrastructure projects across the United States, including relocating rail yards in El Paso and a rail line connection in Portsmouth. It also mandates a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980. Additionally, a new grant program called the Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program is established to improve freight mobility around U.S. ports. The SAFETEA program continues the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) to help states develop and maintain recreational trails for various trail uses. It authorizes $370 million in contract authority for FY2005-2009 and sets aside $840,000 annually for administrative expenses. Funds are allocated to states by a legislative formula. Under SAFETEA, the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) allocates funds to states based on off-road recreational fuel use. States must use 30% of RTP funds for motorized trails, 30% for non-motorized trails, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates waivers for the 30% provision but retains exemptions for small states. The program also adjusts the federal share for RTP projects and encourages states to use youth conservation or service corps for trail construction and maintenance. SAFETEA expands permissible uses for RTP funding to include trail safety, monitoring patrols, and training. It also allows funding for trail condition assessment and permits pre-approval planning and environmental compliance costs to be credited toward project costs. DOT must comply with environmental review requirements before highway or transit projects can proceed, as mandated by NEPA. NEPA requires the Department of Transportation to consider environmental impacts of federally funded actions through the preparation of environmental impact statements (EIS) or environmental assessments (EA). Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required within the NEPA process. The Transportation Act of 1966 includes Section 4(f) requirements for using publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects. The law prohibits using these resources unless there is no alternative and all efforts are made to minimize harm. Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite large projects while protecting the environment through improved interagency cooperation. The Transportation Act of 1966 includes Section 4(f) requirements for using publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects. The law prohibits using these resources unless there is no alternative and all efforts are made to minimize harm. Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite large projects while protecting the environment through improved interagency cooperation. Congress identified environmental streamlining as crucial for project success, leading to the development of a coordinated review process for highway projects with significant environmental impacts. SAFETEA includes provisions to further streamline the environmental review process, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. It establishes a new entity called a \"participating agency\" and outlines procedures for collaborative development in the NEPA process. SAFETEA provisions streamline environmental review process, establish participating agencies for collaborative development in NEPA process. Includes deadlines, statute of limitations, dispute resolution, use of transportation funds, state pilot programs for compliance with environmental laws. Section 4(f) allows use of parks and recreation areas with \"de minimis impacts\" with concurrence from jurisdictional official. SAFETEA provisions require concurrence from relevant authorities for use of parks or historic sites with minimal impact under Section 4(f) requirements. DOT must issue regulations clarifying factors for determining alternative feasibility. Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" but individual elements may have historic significance protected under Section 4(f). The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) established the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and help states comply with air quality standards. Funding is allocated for projects like transportation control measures, emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Allocation of CMAQ funds is based on population and pollution reduction needs in areas not meeting air quality standards. The CMAQ program, established under ISTEA, aims to reduce emissions and help states comply with air quality standards. Funding allocation is based on population and pollution reduction needs in areas not meeting standards. SAFETEA expanded program funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. Total CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 was $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ program funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. It also directed DOT to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a population of 159 million must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reach attainment under the Clean Air Act. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs, ensuring they do not worsen air quality or delay standard attainment. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must demonstrate conformity every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. The impact of conformity requirements is expected to increase due to emissions from SUVs and light trucks. The growth of emissions from SUVs and light trucks, along with increased vehicle miles traveled, has made it difficult to demonstrate conformity. Recent court decisions have tightened conformity rules, and more stringent air quality standards will subject additional areas to conformity. Metropolitan areas may face a temporary suspension of highway and transit funds unless sharp emission reductions are imposed. Only 5 areas had to change transportation plans in the past 6 years due to conformity lapses, but one-third of planners expect future difficulties. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers for conformity. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers for conformity, with limited exemptions for certain projects. Concerns have been raised about the mismatch between transportation planning cycles and the need for better coordination. The GAO recommended extending the time frame between required transportation plan updates, but this was met with opposition from environmental groups and air quality planning officials. P.L. 109-59 now requires less frequent conformity demonstrations. P.L. 109-59 requires less frequent conformity demonstrations, shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases, and establishes a 12-month grace period for non-conformity. The law also mandates consultation with local air pollution control agencies and public comments solicitation for any planning horizon changes."
