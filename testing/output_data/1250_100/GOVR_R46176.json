    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes programs to support individuals pursuing postsecondary education and institutions of higher education. The Act was last reauthorized in 2008, with funding extended through FY2015. The College Affordability Act aims to comprehensively reauthorize HEA programs and create new postsecondary education programs. The enactment of H.R. 4674 would increase mandatory and discretionary spending outlays significantly over a 5 to 10-year period. The bill focuses on key themes and proposes major changes in federal student loans and Pell Grant programs. H.R. 4674 proposes comprehensive reauthorization of the HEA, focusing on expanding financial aid, implementing borrower-focused reforms, modifying institutional accountability, enhancing transparency, and creating new grant programs to reduce postsecondary costs. H.R. 4674 aims to expand federal student aid programs, particularly through increasing funding for grant programs like Pell Grants. Pell Grants are need-based grants available to eligible undergraduate students, with eligibility determined by expected family contribution. The program is the largest grant program in Title IV, providing grants to about 7.1 million students totaling around $28.7 billion in a year. Eligible applicants receive grants through the Pell Grant program, with the maximum grant amount based on the difference between the total maximum grant and the student's expected family contribution. H.R. 4674 aims to increase funding for Pell Grants, the largest need-based grant program in Title IV. The bill would raise the total maximum Pell Grant and expand eligibility for students and educational programs. It would also authorize discretionary appropriations for the program, with the total maximum grant consisting of a mandatory add-on award and a discretionary award. The mandatory add-on award amount would increase in AY2021-2022 and beyond, with the upcoming award year's total maximum Pell Grant set at $6,345. The mandatory add-on award for AY2021-2022 would be $1,685, increasing the total maximum grant amount to $6,970. H.R. 4674 would further increase the grant by the rate of inflation each year, funded by mandatory appropriations. This increase would make currently eligible students eligible for larger Pell Grants, with some previously ineligible students becoming eligible. Additionally, H.R. 4674 would expand Pell Grant availability by increasing the period of eligibility. H.R. 4674 proposes increasing the lifetime eligibility limit for Pell Grants from 12 to 14 full-time semesters. It also aims to allow incarcerated individuals to receive Pell Grants and permit some graduate students to receive Pell Grants at public and nonprofit institutions. Additionally, the bill would create a new category for job training programs to be eligible for Pell Grants. H.R. 4674 proposes creating \"Job Training Federal Pell Grants\" for shorter programs of 150-600 hours over 8-15 weeks. Programs must align with high-demand sectors, offer academic credit, and be provided by eligible institutions. Pell Grants for shorter programs may be less than the maximum award for full-time students. The Federal Perkins Loan program expired in 2017, but H.R. 4674 proposes a new Direct Perkins Loan program that would be different from the previous program. Under this new program, the federal government would lend directly to students and be responsible for loan servicing and collections. Loans with similar terms as Direct Unsubsidized Loans would be available. Under H.R. 4674, a new Direct Perkins Loan program would offer loans to students with terms similar to Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Undergraduate students could borrow up to $5,500 annually and $27,500 in total, while graduate and professional students could borrow up to $8,000 annually and $60,000 in total. The interest rate for Direct Perkins Loans would be fixed at 5% per year, and loan limits would be separate from the Direct Loan program. Loan authority would be allocated to institutions based on student need and Pell Grant funds, with a base guarantee for loan authority provided. H.R. 4674 would provide mandatory appropriations of up to $2.4 billion annually for the Perkins Loan program, making changes to the formulas used to distribute funds for campus-based grant programs. It would also increase authorized appropriations levels for these programs. Additionally, the bill would establish a new Direct Perkins Loan program with fixed interest rates and separate loan limits from the Direct Loan program, allocating loan authority to institutions based on student need and Pell Grant funds. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the distribution formulas for campus-based grant programs, including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG). It introduces a modified fair share formula that considers unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. The bill also establishes new institutional eligibility criteria based on the proportion of Pell Grant recipients enrolled. Additionally, it increases authorized appropriations levels for the FSEOG program, starting at $1.15 billion in FY2021 and increasing by $150 million annually until reaching $1.75 billion in FY2025. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the distribution formulas for campus-based grant programs, including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG). It introduces a modified fair share formula that considers unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. The bill also establishes new institutional eligibility criteria based on the proportion of Pell Grant recipients enrolled. Additionally, it increases authorized appropriations levels for the FSEOG program, starting at $1.15 billion in FY2021 and increasing by $150 million annually until reaching $1.75 billion in FY2025. The bill creates an emergency grant program for FSEOG-participating IHEs, funded through a $12.5 million set-aside from the FSEOG appropriation for FY2021 through FY2026. Participating IHEs would need to provide a 50% match and priority would be given to those with at least 30% Pell Grant-eligible students. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the distribution formulas for campus-based grant programs, including the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program. It introduces a modified fair share formula that considers unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. The bill also establishes new institutional eligibility criteria based on Pell Grant recipients and zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for undergraduate and graduate students. The authorization of discretionary appropriations would increase to $1.5 billion in FY2021, with annual increases until reaching $2.5 billion in FY2025. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the distribution formulas for campus-based grant programs, including the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program. It introduces a modified fair share formula that considers unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. The bill also establishes new institutional eligibility criteria based on Pell Grant recipients and zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for undergraduate and graduate students. The authorization of discretionary appropriations would increase to $1.5 billion in FY2021, with annual increases until reaching $2.5 billion in FY2025. The bill would reserve a portion of the FWS appropriation for a new grant program for \"improved institutions\" based on the share and performance of Pell Grant recipients. Individual eligibility for student aid programs is contingent on student need, with changes to the HEA that could reduce EFC levels. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the Higher Education Act (HEA) that could increase aid eligibility by reducing Expected Family Contribution (EFC) levels. The bill includes provisions such as expanding automatic zero EFC eligibility to more applicants and creating FAFSA pathways based on income and tax return complexity. Applicants who received means-tested benefits in the previous 24 months would have simplified financial information requirements. H.R. 4674 proposes a one-time FAFSA option for Pell-eligible students in their first year of postsecondary education. It also streamlines procedures for foster care and homeless youth to establish and verify their status for federal student aid eligibility. Additionally, the bill extends eligibility for HEA Title IV student aid to unauthorized individuals who entered the U.S. at a young age. The bill, H.R. 4674, extends eligibility for federal student aid to unauthorized individuals who entered the U.S. at a young age and meet certain criteria. It also includes student loan reforms for the Direct Loan program, the primary federal student loan program currently in operation. The Direct Loan program, authorized under HEA, Title IV, Part D, is the largest federal program providing financial assistance for students' postsecondary education. It offers various types of loans to students and their families, with funds borrowed from the U.S. Treasury and loan servicing handled by federal contractors hired by the Department of Education. The Direct Loan program, authorized under HEA, Title IV, Part D, offers various types of loans to students and their families. In FY2020, 15.9 million new loans totaling $100.2 billion will be made through the program, with 755,000 Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $46.4 billion. H.R. 4674 proposes borrower-focused reforms to ease student loan burden by amending loan terms and conditions. As of FY2019, $1.2 trillion in loans remained outstanding. H.R. 4674 proposes eliminating loan origination fees for Direct Loans to make student loan repayment easier and more affordable for borrowers. This bill aims to streamline administrative procedures and expand refinancing options to help manage student loan debt. Borrowers have various loan repayment plan options, including standard, extended, graduated, income-driven, and alternative plans. Income-driven plans base monthly payments on a percentage of adjusted gross income above 150% of the federal poverty guideline. Monthly payments may be capped at the amount under a standard 10-year repayment plan, with remaining balances forgiven after 20 or 25 years. H.R. 4674 proposes two new loan repayment plans - a fixed repayment plan and an income-based repayment (IBR) plan. Borrowers of Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2021, would be required to repay their loans according to these plans. The fixed repayment plan would offer fixed monthly payments with repayment periods of 10 to 25 years. The IBR plan would be more generous in considering income when establishing monthly loan payments for many borrowers. The proposed IBR plan under H.R. 4674 would calculate borrowers' monthly payments based on a percentage of their adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding a specified income protection level tied to federal poverty guidelines. The income protection level varies based on AGI, with a phase-out for higher earners. Negative amortization is allowed, and after 20 years of payments, any remaining balance may be forgiven. The federal government subsidizes interest on Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduate students during certain periods, such as in-school, grace periods, and deferment. Deferment and forbearance provide temporary relief for borrowers struggling with payments, but any accrued interest is later added to the loan balance. H.R. 4674 proposes making Direct Subsidized Loans available to graduate and professional students at public and private nonprofit institutions starting July 1, 2021. The bill aims to keep the interest rate on these loans the same as Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate students. It also suggests that accrued interest during deferment or forbearance periods should not be added to the loan balance. Additionally, the bill expands eligibility for loan discharge and forgiveness options for borrowers. H.R. 4674 would expand borrower eligibility for loan discharge and forgiveness options. The bill aims to define the standards for borrower defense to repayment more explicitly, with some standards applicable to Direct Loans. The new regulations effective July 1, 2020, are seen as less beneficial to borrowers compared to current regulations. H.R. 4674 would expand borrower eligibility for loan discharge and forgiveness options, including specifying standards for borrower defense to repayment applicable to Direct Loans. The bill would require the fair resolution of claims and expand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to new types of employees. The bill H.R. 4674 aims to streamline administrative processes for borrowers by authorizing the Department of Education to automatically provide certain loan benefits without requiring action from the borrower. This includes refinanced federal loans under the Refinanced Direct Loan program and tools to help borrowers determine eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Administrative functions are carried out by ED-contracted loan servicers and collection agencies to ensure borrowers receive Direct Loan terms and benefits. The bill H.R. 4674 authorizes the Department of Education to automatically place certain delinquent borrowers into the IBR plan, recertify and recalculate repayments under the IDR plan, monitor income for disability loan discharge, and develop standardized procedures for loan servicers. Additionally, it allows for refinancing federal student loan debt through Direct Consolidation Loans with fixed interest rates. H.R. 4674 authorizes the Department of Education to establish new loan refinancing options for student loans, allowing qualified borrowers to refinance Direct Loan and FFEL program loans into a refinanced Direct Loan with fixed interest rates. This option is beneficial for borrowers with existing loans with higher interest rates. The bill authorizes the Department of Education to offer refinancing options for student loans, allowing borrowers to refinance into a Direct Loan with fixed interest rates based on the type of loan. Refinancing would not start a new repayment period and could also apply to private education loans. Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loans would have fixed interest rates based on the type of loan borrowed, not counting against a borrower's Direct Loan limits. These loans would not include certain forgiveness benefits available for Direct Loan borrowers. The interest rates for undergraduate study loans would be 4.53%, for graduate or professional study loans 6.08%, and for both types of study loans 7.08%. H.R. 4674 aims to strengthen accountability requirements for institutions of higher education (IHEs) by addressing educational, fiscal, and Title IX requirements. This includes ensuring quality educational programs and financial stewardship of federal student aid funds. The bill reflects a congressional interest in enhancing accountability across all types of IHEs, with a focus on Title IV programs and proprietary IHEs. H.R. 4674 focuses on enhancing accountability for institutions of higher education, particularly in relation to Title IV student aid programs. Accreditation agencies must assess student achievement and quality of education, with varying standards and procedures. H.R. 4674 aims to standardize practices among accrediting agencies by requiring evaluation of student educational outcomes like completion and workforce participation. It also mandates standardized definitions for accrediting agency actions and public disclosure requirements. Additionally, the bill includes changes to the recognition process for accrediting agencies, such as making their applications publicly available and submitting information to Congress. H.R. 4674 introduces new accountability metrics for Title IV institutions, including on-time repayment rates and instructional spending. The metrics aim to ensure quality education and financial responsibility, with a focus on student loan repayment and instructional expenditures. The bill introduces new accountability metrics for Title IV institutions, including phasing out the current cohort default rate (CDR) metric and replacing it with an adjusted cohort default rate that considers the relative risk an institution poses to students and taxpayers. Institutions would face loss of Title IV eligibility if they exceed certain thresholds based on the adjusted CDR. H.R. 4674 introduces new accountability metrics for Title IV institutions, replacing the cohort default rate with an adjusted cohort default rate. Institutions with high adjusted CDRs over multiple fiscal years would face penalties. The bill also requires borrowers in forbearance for three or more years to be considered in default. Additionally, it mandates the establishment of metrics by the Department of Education to assess the preparation of students for gainful employment in various educational programs. H.R. 4674 revises financial responsibility standards for Title IV institutions, requiring them to post a letter of credit to ED in certain circumstances. It specifies conditions where private nonprofit or proprietary institutions may not be considered financially responsible, such as submitting a teach-out plan or facing borrower defense claims. The bill also outlines when ED must reassess an institution's financial responsibility. H.R. 4674 would amend financial responsibility standards for Title IV institutions, requiring them to post a letter of credit to ED in specific situations. It outlines conditions where institutions may be deemed financially irresponsible, such as facing borrower defense claims or failing to meet state requirements. Additionally, the bill revises the 90/10 Rule for proprietary institutions, now requiring them to derive at least 15% of their revenues from non-federal sources. H.R. 4674 would establish new financial responsibility standards for Title IV institutions, including limiting marketing expenditures and prohibiting ED from enforcing proposed Title IX regulations. The Higher Education Act (HEA) aims to provide consumer information for informed college and financial decisions. It includes measures for college affordability and consumer information dissemination. The HEA currently mandates the College Navigator website and Net Price Calculators for prospective students. It prohibits the creation of a new student unit record system for tracking individual student data. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the Higher Education Act to enhance public accountability, transparency, and consumer information requirements. It would repeal the ban on creating a new student unit record system and require the development of a postsecondary student-level data system for evaluating student outcomes and enrollment. These changes aim to provide consumers with more detailed information to make informed decisions about college and student loans. H.R. 4674 aims to enhance public accountability and transparency in higher education by proposing a student-level data system to evaluate student outcomes and enrollment. It also includes provisions for more detailed information on costs of attendance, financial aid offers, and counseling for student loan borrowers. H.R. 4674 proposes new programs to support students, including the Student Success Fund for institutional reforms and the Pell Bonus Program for financial aid and student support services. The bill aims to enhance accountability and transparency in higher education with a student-level data system for evaluating outcomes and enrollment. H.R. 4674 proposes new programs to support students, including funds for financial aid and student support services, remedial education grants, and grants for improving access to higher education for foster and homeless youth. The bill authorizes appropriations for these programs to enhance accountability and transparency in higher education. H.R. 4674 authorizes $150 million for FY2021 with inflation-adjusted amounts through FY2026 for a new grant program called Jumpstart to College. It also authorizes $250 million per year for FY2021 through FY2026 for student support programs, including a significant increase for TRIO programs to $1.12 billion for FY2021. The Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program would receive a significant increase in funding under H.R. 4674, with $200 million authorized annually for FY2021 and the following five years. This program provides grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to support low-income parents in postsecondary education by offering child care services. The Higher Education Act (HEA) also authorizes grant programs for minority serving institutions (MSIs) to enhance their academic, administrative, and financial capabilities. These MSIs include American Indian Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native and Native-Hawaiian-serving Institutions, Predominantly Black Institutions, Native American-serving Nontribal Institutions, and Asian American and Native American Pacific-serving Institutions. H.R. 4674 aims to permanently authorize mandatory appropriations of $300 million annually for Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and extend discretionary appropriations through FY2026. It also reauthorizes funding for programs like the Endowment Challenge Grant and creates new grant programs to support MSIs. Additionally, the bill amends and reauthorizes funding for Tribally Controlled Colleges. H.R. 4674 would create a new HEA, Title IV, Part J, authorizing grants to states, Indian tribes, and IHEs to reduce tuition and fees at community colleges. It would provide grants to states to waive tuition and fees for eligible students, including those from qualified Indian tribes. Eligible students must attend community college at least half-time and meet certain criteria, with no financial requirements. The bill would provide permanent mandatory appropriations starting in FY2021, incrementally increasing from $1,569,700,000. The bill H.R. 4674 proposes funding increases from $1,569,700,000 in FY2021 to $16,296,080,000 in FY2030 for grants to states to waive tuition and fees for eligible students at community colleges. States must provide a nonfederal share, and eligible students can use other financial aid for additional costs. States receiving grants must waive tuition and fees for eligible students attending community colleges within the state. H.R. 4674 proposes funding increases for grants to states to waive tuition and fees for eligible students at community colleges. The bill would create new programs for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions to waive or reduce tuition and fees for eligible students. Grants would cover the actual cost of tuition and fees at the institution for eligible students. H.R. 4674 proposes permanent funding increases for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions to waive or reduce tuition and fees for eligible students. The funding level would incrementally increase from $63,250,000 in FY2021 to $1,626,040,000 in FY2030, with mandatory appropriations provided at the FY2030 level in succeeding years. Additionally, the bill would authorize discretionary appropriations for new grant programs to support students with unmet financial need, starting with Pell Grant recipients at public institutions. The bill authorizes grant programs for private nonprofit IHEs and states to waive resident tuition and fees for eligible students with unmet financial need. Programs would have a federal share of 75% and a nonfederal share of 25%."
