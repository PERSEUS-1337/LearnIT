    "content": "The \"Video Game Rating Act of 1994\" aims to provide parents with information about video games used in homes or public areas. It defines video games and the video game industry, and establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission (the \"Commission\") is established as an independent executive branch establishment with 5 members appointed by the President. No more than 3 members can be affiliated with the same political party. The Chairman receives compensation based on the Executive Schedule. The Commission members are paid based on the Executive Schedule, with the Chairman receiving a specific compensation. The Chairman can appoint an executive director and staff without following civil service laws, and their compensation is determined by the Chairman. The Commission can hire consultants through contracts and set user fees to reimburse the government. Funding is authorized for the Commission's duties until December 31, 1996, and the Commission will terminate by that date. The Commission's funding is authorized until December 31, 1996, or 90 days after voluntary standards for warning labels on violent or sexually explicit video games are established. The Commission is authorized to establish voluntary standards for warning labels on violent or sexually explicit video games. The Commission is tasked with coordinating with the video game industry to develop voluntary standards for informing purchasers about the content of video games, particularly violence or sexually explicit material. After one year, the Commission will evaluate the industry's proposed standards to determine if they sufficiently warn parents and users about the content. If deemed adequate, the Commission will establish these voluntary standards. The Commission will submit a report to the President and Congress on the determination of voluntary standards for video games and may enforce regulations requiring manufacturers to provide information on violence or sexually explicit content to purchasers and users. Antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the video game industry to create voluntary guidelines for disclosing sex or violence content to consumers. This exemption does not cover actions leading to a boycott."
