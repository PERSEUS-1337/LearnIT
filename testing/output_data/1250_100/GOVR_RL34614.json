    "content": "Nanotechnology focuses on understanding and exploiting unique properties of matter at nanoscale. Congress is concerned about protecting human health and the environment. Research has raised concerns about potential environmental and health implications of nanoscale materials. The Federal government may use research, regulation, and international engagement to address these issues. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) aims to address potential adverse implications for the environment, human health, and safety associated with nanotechnology products. EHS concerns focus on engineered nanomaterials intentionally designed and produced, raising issues about the environmental impact of nanomanufacturing processes and the use of nanotechnology products. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is a federal effort to coordinate and expand nanotechnology research and development (R&D) with significant investments from the government and private sector. Global investments in nanotechnology R&D totaled over $17 billion in 2008 alone, raising concerns about the potential effects on human health, safety, and the environment. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) aims to coordinate and expand nanotechnology research and development (R&D) with substantial investments. There are uncertainties regarding the impact of nanoscale particles on human health, safety, and the environment, including their transportation, reactions, distribution, and accumulation. Some argue that concerns about nanotechnology's environmental, health, and safety (EHS) implications are exaggerated, citing factors such as the embedding of nanoscale materials in other substances, the aggregation of particles, and natural exposure to nanoscale particles. The NNI requires additional research for a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials. Precautionary measures should be taken to protect health and safety until more information is available. Stakeholders agree that concerns about the effects of nanoscale materials must be addressed, including toxicity, risk assessment, and environmental interactions. The report discusses the opportunities and challenges of nanotechnology, emphasizes the importance of addressing EHS concerns, and suggests options for congressional action. The curr_chunk discusses EHS issues related to nanotechnology and options for congressional action. It also provides an overview of federal agencies' roles in regulating nanotechnology. The text highlights the historical EHS challenges of new technologies like automobiles. Nanotechnology offers economic and societal benefits, along with potential EHS challenges. Proponents believe it can reduce risks and provide benefits such as energy conservation, pollution reduction, disease management, and new materials for various applications. Nanotechnology has various applications in preventing, detecting, tracking, and removing pollutants. It has been developed to decrease diesel engine emissions, remove contaminants from soil and ground water, and improve detection and tracking of contaminants. In the area of human health, nanotechnology shows potential for improving disease diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment. The National Cancer Institute has launched initiatives focused on applying nanotechnology to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment, with the goal of ending death and suffering from cancer by 2015. Nanoscale particles have both positive and negative consequences, with unique properties that can be beneficial but also have unknown toxicological and environmental effects. For example, nanoscale silver is effective as an antibacterial agent but concerns exist about its widespread dispersion killing vital microbes in ecosystems. Some nanoscale particles may penetrate the blood-brain barrier, posing potential risks. Certain nanoscale materials have the potential to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, allowing for targeted delivery of medicine to treat conditions like brain tumors. However, there are concerns about unintended harm from nanoparticles passing through the barrier. Nanoscale materials with high reactivity are being explored for various applications such as catalysis, groundwater treatment, and protective gear against chemical and biological agents. Research suggests that some nanoparticles may cause cell damage in animals. Carbon nanotubes have diverse potential uses in materials, electronics, and medical applications. Nanotechnology encompasses various scientific fields and applications, including materials like carbon nanotubes used in electronics and medical imaging. Concerns exist about potential health risks from certain nanomaterials resembling asbestos fibers. More research is needed to understand the implications of nanoscale particles on human health and the environment. The 2006 National Research Council and the 2008 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reports found that assessing nanotechnology EHS risks was not possible due to lack of information and tools. Research is needed to develop risk assessment protocols for potential EHS risks from nanomaterials. Nanotechnology products may pose new risks to human health and the environment due to their ability to penetrate inaccessible areas in the body and exhibit different behaviors at the nanoscale. Leaders of the NNI emphasize the importance of addressing potential adverse effects of nanotechnology to achieve economic, societal, and EHS benefits. The NRC's assessment highlights that EHS-related uncertainty could hinder innovation and commercialization without detailed scientific evidence and effective communication of risks. The uncertainty surrounding the risks of nanotechnology could undermine confidence among investors, businesses, and consumers, potentially jeopardizing its success. Consumer and advocacy groups have raised concerns about engineered nanomaterials in various products, leading to regulatory uncertainty and industry hesitation. An evaluation of the health and environmental effects of nanomaterials is deemed necessary to address these uncertainties and ensure the future of nanotechnology. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) has warned about risks to the public, workforce, and environment from exposure to nano particles. It is crucial for the government to address potential health effects and environmental risks associated with nanotechnology. Successfully addressing EHS issues is vital for protecting human health, safety, and the environment, ensuring public confidence in nanotechnology, and preventing negative consequences. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology is crucial for preventing negative consequences and ensuring economic benefits. Effective regulation can promote innovation, economic growth, and job creation, while a lack of predictability and lengthy approval processes could hinder progress and pose a threat to advancement in the field. Nanotechnology regulation is essential for preventing negative consequences and ensuring economic benefits. It can drive innovation, economic growth, and job creation, but a lack of predictability and lengthy approval processes may hinder progress and pose threats to health, safety, and the environment. Investment capital may be driven away, leading to missed economic opportunities, while other nations with more favorable regulatory environments may attract nanotechnology investments and research. The discourse on addressing nanotechnology EHS concerns focuses on federal investment in EHS research and regulation. Federal investment in EHS research, regulation, and international coordination are crucial for addressing nanotechnology EHS concerns. International collaboration can accelerate the development of a common knowledge base, leading to more consistent regulations globally. Coordination of regulations and enforcement worldwide is necessary to protect workers and consumers along global supply chains. In FY2010, the NNI budget for EHS implications research was approximately $91.6 million, representing 5.1% of the total NNI budget. This marked an increase from the FY2009 and FY2008 levels of $74.5 million and $67.9 million, respectively. The funding allocation process is decentralized, with individual agencies developing their budgets internally and seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget. President Obama requested $116.9 million (6.6%) for EHS research in FY2011, representing an increase from previous years. NNI officials state that EHS research is conducted as part of other research activities, making it challenging to quantify. PCAST agrees that separating nanotechnology EHS research from application research is unproductive and may hinder overall progress. The NEHI working group found that NNI agencies spent nearly twice as much on EHS research in FY2006 than previously reported. Critics argue that federal nanotechnology EHS research funding is too low and may lead to inadequate management of EHS risks. Executive branch officials emphasize that EHS research is integrated into other research activities, making it difficult to quantify separately. The United States leads in EHS funding for nanotechnology development and research, investing significantly more than other countries. Federal EHS research funding is recommended to be expanded to ensure responsible development of nanotechnology. PCAST recommended expanding funding for nanotechnology EHS research to address potential risks. They emphasized the importance of targeted funding for strategic research over absolute dollar amounts to effectively address emerging EHS issues. The scientific community is conducting exploratory research on biological and environmental interactions with nanomaterials. PCAST recommends increasing funding for nanotechnology EHS research to address specific issues. Various alternatives, such as allocating a fixed percentage of funding to EHS research, have been suggested by organizations like the NanoBusiness Alliance and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies. In FY2010, the NNI would have needed to spend $178.1 million on EHS research, double the reported level. The NanoBusiness Alliance supports 10% funding for EHS research but emphasizes the importance of a clear research strategy. The Environmental Defense Fund has called for $100 million or more in federal nanotechnology EHS research funding. In 2008, PCAST emphasized the need for strategic growth in nanotechnology EHS research, advocating for a comprehensive set of priorities rather than arbitrary funding percentages. While some suggest a 10% funding requirement to accelerate EHS research, caution is advised against rapid funding increases as quality may suffer. NGOs advocate for a more restrained approach to nanotechnology research, expressing concerns about insufficient knowledge of EHS implications. Some groups advocate for precautionary measures in nanotechnology due to potential risks to health and the environment. Calls have been made for a moratorium on the commercial release of products containing nanomaterials until safety studies and regulations are in place. The ETC Group has also called for a halt in nanotechnology R&D and use of products with man-made nanoparticles. The ETC Group has called for a moratorium on commercial production of new nanomaterials and products with synthetic nanoparticles that directly contact consumers. In contrast, the NSET Subcommittee believes that conducting EHS research alongside nanomaterial development will ensure safe and responsible use of nanotechnology. Phillip J. Bond has also suggested a moratorium or slowdown in nanotechnology R&D, emphasizing ethical considerations. The ethical debate surrounding nanotechnology focuses on the necessity of harnessing its power to address societal issues. Policymakers must prioritize research on assessing the effects of engineered nanomaterials on public health and the environment, with a focus on workplace exposure. In 2005, PCAST prioritized research on workplace exposure to nanomaterials due to the highest likelihood of exposure during manufacture. In 2008, PCAST reiterated this point and acknowledged broader risks, including environmental and safety risks. The NSET published a Federal Strategy for EHS Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials in February 2008, outlining research priorities and lead agencies for different categories. The NSET requested an independent review of the Federal Strategy for Nanotechnology-related Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Research in 2009. The NRC review highlighted poorly defined research needs in risk management and exposure assessment, lack of concrete objectives, inadequate funding, flawed gap analysis, and dominance of federal EHS nanotechnology funding. The NRC review identified the need for a national strategy involving various stakeholders to address research gaps in EHS nanotechnology funding. This strategy would provide clear research needs, estimate resources required, and focus on interdisciplinary solutions to prevent research gaps. A comprehensive approach to federal EHS research has been hindered by the lack of an NNI roadmap. Stakeholders are calling for a multi-year roadmap with specific milestones, metrics, and funding levels to coordinate efforts among agencies and branches of government. NNI officials have developed an EHS research strategy but acknowledge the need for a more detailed roadmap. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the time taken to produce a prioritized implementation plan for NNI EHS research. Opposition to an EHS roadmap is based on doubts about its practicality and effectiveness. Opposition to an EHS roadmap is primarily due to doubts about its practicality and efficacy. Some argue that committing to a multi-year, multi-agency roadmap with specific funding levels could hinder flexibility in budget development and impede agencies' ability to respond to new priorities. To address these challenges, some suggest the National Academies produce the roadmap instead. In February 2007, various organizations requested $1 million for a federal roadmap and research strategy on nanotechnology, urging EPA to collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academies' Board on Environmental Science and Toxicology initiated a research project in July 2009, sponsored by the EPA, to develop a research strategy for environmental, health, and safety aspects of engineered nanomaterials. The project aims to produce two reports over four years, with the first report focusing on a conceptual framework, research priorities, monitoring strategy, and resource estimates. The second report, due in July 2013, will evaluate research progress and update priorities based on industry trends. The process for developing research priorities and the federal EHS budget has raised management concerns. The federal nanotechnology EHS research portfolio is influenced by research funding requests from individual agencies and congressional appropriations. Coordination among EHS funding agencies occurs through the NEHI working group and OMB budget development process. PCAST recommended organizational changes to support cross-agency action on nanotechnology EHS issues, including creating a senior-level position at NNCO. The Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies advocates for a more integrated federal EHS research effort. Maynard emphasized the need for a master plan to address potential risks of nanotechnology, including a top-down research strategy, adequate funding, and effective resource utilization. PEN recommended empowering the NEHI working group, increasing EHS funding, and appointing a full-time director. However, Dr. Teague argued against creating a centralized office for EHS research, stating that the current interagency coordination is successful and a new central authority would undermine it. Creating a separate office for nanotechnology EHS research could potentially hinder existing successful interagency coordination. It may lead to a decrease in research levels as mission agencies might redirect resources assuming another agency is responsible. On the other hand, it could result in duplicative work and wastage of tax dollars. Andrew Maynard suggests a functional structure that allows agencies to work within a broader plan without the need for a centralized office, emphasizing the importance of top-down leadership to ensure resources are effectively utilized. Several concerns have been raised about the adequacy of current laws and regulations to protect human health, safety, and the environment from potential adverse implications of nanotechnology. Market forces have accelerated global innovation, challenging institutions to keep pace with rapid changes. Speed-to-market has become a key factor in competition due to new competitors, increased R&D investments, global innovation models, and a larger pool of scientists and engineers worldwide. The rapid growth in nanotechnology investments since 2000 and the unique properties of nanomaterials pose challenges to the regulatory system. Questions are being raised about how to structure an EHS research portfolio when particle size affects material properties. Some experts argue that existing regulatory authorities are adequate for handling EHS concerns about nanotechnology products, while others see legal obstacles to effective regulation. PCAST concluded that appropriate regulatory mechanisms should be used to address harmful effects of nanotechnology, and new regulatory policies should be rational, science-based, and consistent. Sean Murdock stated that the apparatus for nanotechnology regulation is largely in place but lacks data and resources, calling for increased funding to ensure regulatory success. Some experts argue that existing regulatory authorities may not be sufficient for nanotechnology regulation. J. Clarence Davies suggests that current laws like the Toxic Substances Control Act and others lack the necessary legal authority and resources to effectively regulate nanomaterials. Increased funding, coordination between agencies, and establishment of metrics and standards are needed for successful nanotech regulation. Nanotechnology regulation may require a new law to manage potential risks. Manufacturers would need to submit a sustainability plan to ensure products are safe. Existing regulatory agencies lack the capability to address the challenges posed by advanced technologies like nanotechnology. Davies proposes the creation of a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection for better oversight. The proposed agency would have a strong oversight component, incorporating six existing regulatory and science agencies with new units for risk assessment, forecasting, technology assessment, health monitoring, and environmental statistics collection. New mechanisms and capabilities are needed to encourage beneficial nanotechnology applications. Businesses seek stability and predictability in regulations to attract investment and spur commercialization, as ambiguity hampers progress. Federal agencies like the EPA and OSHA are considering how to regulate nanoparticles in order to balance promoting nanotechnology development, ensuring U.S. competitiveness, and addressing potential health and safety concerns. There is debate on whether health and safety research should be done concurrently with product development or before nanotechnology commercialization to prevent harm. Concerns have been raised about the need for regulation to keep pace with innovation to avoid potential damage. The hazards of nanotechnology exposure have been identified, but there are no mandatory workplace measures in place to assess exposures, train workers, or implement control measures. It is recommended that nanotechnology not be rushed to market until these safety issues are addressed. Various assessments have highlighted the need for additional EHS data to inform risk-based guidelines and precautionary measures to protect workers, the public, and the environment. Regulatory decisions should consider the overall risks and benefits of nanotechnology products and not hold them to a higher standard than non-nanotechnology products. The NNI has a vital role in supporting federal regulatory agencies by providing EHS research results and coordinating efforts with other nations to avoid duplication and leverage investments in nanotechnology development. International engagement on EHS issues is crucial for responsible development and successful commercialization of nanotechnology. The NSET established the Global Issues in Nanotechnology (GIN) working group in 2005 to monitor foreign nanotechnology programs, promote U.S. commercial and trade interests, and broaden international collaboration on nanotechnology R&D, including research on safeguarding the environment and human health. Advocates for international engagement highlight benefits such as transparency and harmonization of standards and regulations to ensure global supply chain integrity and market confidence in nanotechnology products. Increased globalization means companies rely on inputs from multiple suppliers, making transparent standards crucial for product reliability. Nanotechnology presents unique challenges in ensuring proper production and representation of nanoscale materials in products. Without international standards and regulatory systems, producers may face issues with substandard inputs, leading to underperforming or unsafe products. Common standards could improve research comparability, enhance understanding of EHS aspects, and promote regulations for human health and environmental protection. Global engagement in nanotechnology research and development can lead to more effective collaboration, establishing common standards, and promoting access to global markets. Efforts to adopt best practices in nanotechnology can protect human health and the environment worldwide. However, international engagement on EHS research may face challenges such as time, cost, and alleged ineffectiveness of collaborations. Some advocates emphasize the urgency in advancing EHS research, but international collaborations can be slow. The strong U.S. position in nanotechnology may lead some to question the need for global contributions, citing limited resources and potential delays in progress. Others argue that existing mechanisms for sharing research and safety information across borders make explicit nanotechnology-focused international efforts unnecessary. Skepticism towards international engagement may stem from concerns about national interests like military applications and economic growth. In 2003, Under Secretary of Commerce Phillip J. Bond raised doubts about calls to slow down nanotechnology R&D for EHS concerns, suggesting it could be a strategy to close the nanotechnology leadership gap. EHS concerns in nanotechnology research may hinder international cooperation due to competitive strategies and regulatory scrutiny. Addressing environmental, health, and safety implications is crucial for realizing the full benefits of nanotechnology, but the current knowledge on potential risks is insufficient. In the 111th and 112th Congress, various bills were considered to address EHS issues related to nanotechnology research, but none were enacted. The need for a national EHS research strategy to fill knowledge gaps and determine which institutions should be involved remains a key question. The need for a national EHS research strategy to address nanotechnology-related issues remains a key question. Key considerations include the development of a strategy, funding allocation, research prioritization, accountability, information sharing, regulatory adequacy, and interagency coordination. Efforts to improve coordination among federal regulatory agencies and develop common nomenclature and standards in nanotechnology research are crucial for responsible development. International engagement on regulatory issues can enhance confidence in supply chains. Congressional decisions on these issues impact U.S. leadership in nanotechnology, societal benefits, public health, and environmental safety. Five bills in the 111th Congress addressed nanotechnology EHS concerns, with H.R. 5116 focusing on EHS-related provisions similar to H.R. 554. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2010 revises the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, addressing nanotechnology EHS concerns by directing the development of a public database of NNI EHS projects and establishing the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel as a distinct entity. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2010 revises the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act by addressing societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns. It establishes a subpanel to assess these issues, designates an associate director for coordinating societal dimensions of nanotechnology, and requires interdisciplinary research centers to include EHS research. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 aims to expand the scope of the National Nanotechnology Program by promoting rapid commercial development of nanoscale technologies, coordinating research efforts, and including environmental, health, and safety education in nanotechnology programs. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 expands the National Nanotechnology Program to promote commercial development of nanoscale technologies, coordinate research on environmental, health, and safety issues, and establish guidelines for transitioning research into commercial products. It authorizes funding for NIST to develop nanotechnology standards and for NSF to maintain a public database of nanotechnology projects. The Act also establishes the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel to address societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns related to nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 expands the National Nanotechnology Program to address societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns related to nanotechnology. The Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 requires the designation of a coordinator for societal dimensions of nanotechnology, supports nanotechnology R&D in areas of national importance, and directs the establishment of an interagency Education Working Group to coordinate educational activities. The Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act, H.R. 820, introduced in the 111th Congress, requires the establishment of a program for investigating nanoscale materials in FDA-regulated products. It authorizes $25 million per year for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 and mandates the production of an annual research strategy by the NNCO. Federal regulatory agencies are addressing environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a dual role in conducting research and regulating nanotechnology. EPA is focused on gathering information to assess the potential environmental and health impacts of engineered nanoscale materials. They support research on toxicology, exposure, and risk assessment to manage risks associated with nanomaterials. EPA also coordinates federal research efforts in nanotechnology regulation. The EPA plays a central role in coordinating federal research efforts on nanotechnology EHS issues and works with international organizations on regulatory issues. It is governed by multiple statutes including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, FIFRA, and TSCA, raising important issues about regulating nanotechnology under TSCA. EPA's authorities are focused on regulating chemical commerce. TSCA authorizes regulation of chemical commerce, requiring producers of new materials to submit a premanufacture notification to EPA. EPA can approve manufacture, request information, or restrict chemical use within 90 days. Some nanotechnology materials may be considered new under TSCA, while FIFRA may offer more authority for regulating nanotechnology intended for pest control. EPA's regulatory authority under TSCA is broader than under FIFRA, which is use-specific. The EPA has the authority to assess the risk of pesticides regardless of use, with FIFRA regulating use-specific cases. In a November 2006 ruling, nanotechnology products incorporating substances to prevent pests are considered pesticides under FIFRA. The first nanotechnology product regulated under FIFRA was a washing machine with nanoscale silver ions. However, claims of pesticidal effectiveness were removed from advertisements, limiting EPA's regulation. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found in May 2010 that EPA missed opportunities to collect information under various environmental statutes. The FDA regulates various products incorporating nanotechnology, including cosmetics, medical devices, foods, drugs, and combination products. It may not provide regulatory consideration to a nanotechnology product until well after its initial development. Critics argue that FDA's limited regulatory authority over certain products may hinder its ability to regulate nanotechnology products. FDA believes its existing requirements may be sufficient for regulating most nanotechnology products. The agency states that nanotechnology products are in the same size-range as cells and molecules its reviewers deal with daily. The FDA regulates products with nanotechnology, including cosmetics, medical devices, and drugs. FDA believes its current regulations are adequate for most nanotechnology products, which are in the same size range as cells and molecules. The agency collaborates with NIEHS on studies related to nanomaterials. Critics argue that FDA's regulatory approach may not detect problems with emerging technologies like nanotechnology. The FDA collaborates with NIEHS on nanotechnology studies as part of the National Toxicology Program. There is no international regulation of nanoproducts or nanotechnology. NIEHS conducts research to support regulatory agencies, particularly through the Nanotechnology Safety Initiative established in 2006. The National Toxicology Program's Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) focuses on evaluating the toxicological properties of various nanoscale materials, including metal oxides and fluorescent crystalline semiconductors. The research program aims to investigate how nanoscale materials interact with biological systems and potential health hazards associated with their manufacture and use. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) focus on ensuring the safety and health of workers in relation to nanotechnology. NIOSH conducts research and provides guidance on occupational safety and health implications, while OSHA sets and enforces standards, provides training, and encourages workplace safety improvements. NIOSH co-chairs the NSET's NEHI working group with EPA and supports regulatory agencies like OSHA. NIOSH is developing new risk management approaches for nanotechnology to ensure worker safety. They have interim guidelines for working with nanomaterials and maintain a Nanoparticle Information Library. The Consumer Product Safety Commission assesses safety risks of nanomaterials for consumer products. The Consumer Product Safety Commission evaluates safety risks of nanomaterials for consumer products under existing statutes and regulations. Nanotechnology presents unique challenges that require specific exposure and risk assessment strategies, including identifying nanomaterials in products, characterizing materials consumers are exposed to, and applying toxicological data to assess health risks. The CPSC cannot make general statements about consumer exposure or health effects due to the wide variation in nanomaterials. Exposure to nanomaterials during consumer use and disposal poses potential health risks due to limited data on toxicity and exposure."
