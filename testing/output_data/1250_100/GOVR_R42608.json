    "content": "LIBOR is an index measuring the cost of funds for global banks in London. The British Bankers' Association constructs LIBOR, with Thomson Reuters publishing it. A panel of banks is surveyed daily to determine rates, with averages reported at 11:30 a.m. There are separate LIBOR rates for 15 maturities and 10 currencies. In the U.S., contracts often reference the three-month dollar LIBOR, based on rates from a panel of 18 banks including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The U.S. banks on the dollar panel for LIBOR include Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The highest and lowest 4 responses are excluded, and the middle 10 are averaged. Banks can apply to participate in the survey, with similar indexes reported in other locations like EURIBOR for Europe and TIBOR for Tokyo. These indexes measure the cost of borrowing funds for various maturities and currencies, with slight variations in sponsoring organizations and methodologies. The LIBOR index is widely used in private loan contracts and financial derivatives. It is also utilized by futures exchanges and policymakers to assess financial market stress. Private parties voluntarily choose to use LIBOR as a benchmark for setting interest rates in future loans. The borrower will receive a loan with an interest rate based on the LIBOR index value on the future date. Other benchmarks like U.S. Treasury yield or Federal Funds Rate may have shortcomings, and the appropriate alternative varies depending on the borrower and loan maturity. The value of loans and financial instruments referencing LIBOR is significant, with a large percentage of adjustable rate mortgages and municipal contracts tied to the index. While a single bank on the LIBOR reporting panel can influence the index, it may not always be able to move it in the desired direction. The dollar LIBOR panel consists of 18 banks, with only the middle 10 responses being averaged. If a bank manipulates its reported interest rate, it can impact the LIBOR calculation. A single bank can potentially affect the LIBOR under certain circumstances by changing its bid rate. A single bank can potentially affect the LIBOR by changing its bid rate, but there is a limit on the magnitude of the effect. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate LIBOR, which is a violation of U.S. law. They settled separately with UK officials for violating UK law. The settlement documents with Barclays include employee emails showing manipulation of LIBOR in three categories: for trade positions, reputation, and inducing other banks. Collusion can have a greater impact, but only Barclays' attempts were reported. Derivatives trading is just one part of Barclays' balance sheet, and survey responders are supposed to be separate from traders. During 2005-2007, internal emails show traders asking others to submit false bids. Barclays' internal emails reveal derivatives traders asking employees to submit false survey responses to benefit their trading positions. The traders' preferred LIBOR outcome changes daily, with some days preferring high rates and others low rates. Barclays admits to submitting false survey responses during 2005-2007 and in 2008, management wanted to lower responses to protect the firm's reputation during financial turmoil. Barclays faced increasing difficulty in raising funds during financial turmoil, leading to concerns from UK officials about the bank's high LIBOR survey responses. Some Barclays employees believed officials wanted lower responses, although managers denied this. Unlike previous years, Barclays consistently under-reported its cost of funds in 2008. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also raised concerns about Barclays' LIBOR responses and the methodology for the index. The FRBNY raised concerns with UK regulators and the BBA about the methodology for the LIBOR index in 2008. Documents revealed FRBNY's concerns with LIBOR calculation and reporting, including emails between Timothy F. Geithner and Mervyn King discussing recommendations to enhance LIBOR credibility."
