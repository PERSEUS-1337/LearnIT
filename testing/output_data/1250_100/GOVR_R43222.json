Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing  trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and decisions on harbor maintenance now have a greater impact on the U.S. economy than in 1986. The cost of harbor maintenance in the U.S. is supported by a harbor maintenance tax on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. The tax rate is 0.125% of the value of cargo shipped or cruise tickets sold. Revenue from the tax goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund, which covers dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks. HMT revenue is scored as federal receipts, and expenditures from the HMTF are scored as current-year expenditures, reducing the federal budget deficit. About half of the HMT collected annually is spent on harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) collects more than half of the HMT annually for harbor maintenance. The fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013. The Administration's budget requests $923 million for harbor maintenance, while bills in Congress aim to double spending on harbor maintenance. H.R. 3080 would increase HMTF expenditures to ensure 80% of the prior fiscal year's HMT is spent on harbor maintenance by FY2020. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has the potential to reduce funding for other Corps activities funded under the Energy and Water Development Appropriations acts. Congress could compensate for increased funding from the HMTF by allocating more funds to the energy and water development appropriation, but this would require less funding for activities outside this appropriation to stay within total federal budget caps. Congress established the HMTF in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors within the United States. \"Harbors\" are capable of transporting commercial cargo, while \"inland harbors\" are used for commercial vessels and waterborne cargoes. The Corps interprets the term \"commercial navigation\" to mean any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with all operations and maintenance costs payable from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). If a project is authorized as a \"multi-purpose\" project, only expenditures on behalf of commercial navigation are covered by the HMTF. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) only covers expenditures for commercial navigation and joint-use costs allocated to commercial navigation. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. Moderate and low-use ports received a smaller portion of funding despite handling less cargo. This allocation of HMTF funds is a point of contention in the debate between S. 601 and H.R. 3080. The debate between S. 601 and H.R. 3080 revolves around the allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funds. While high-use ports receive a majority of funding despite handling most cargo, low and moderate-use ports receive little federal funding, impacting their ability to support local economies. H.R. 3080 aims to change the allocation criteria, while S. 601 appears to prioritize funding for large commercial cargo ports. An additional 50 waterways eligible for HMTF spending handled minimal cargo, with almost 75% handling little to no cargo. The current allocation of funds favors high-use ports based on cargo volume, but a shift to a value-based metric could benefit ports handling higher value cargo like container ships. The five largest container ports in the US received only half of the O&M funds requested in FY2011. In FY2011, moderate-use ports received 30% of requested funds, while low-use harbors received 10%. Small harbors received only one-tenth of requested funds, while the busiest harbors received half. The Corps stated that the busiest commercial shipping channels operated at authorized widths and depths only 30% of the time in 2008. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work performed on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually. This could hinder the development of moderate-use ports into high-use ports and impact ports with significant fishing and recreational vessel traffic. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, performing maintenance work on 400 to 500 of them annually. A 2012 study revealed that the Corps only actively maintains 360 out of more than 1,400 authorized coastal navigation projects. Questions have been raised about the lack of systematic reevaluation of the economic justification for continued federal investment in harbor projects, leading to passive stewardship of resources. The policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and maintaining or disposing of them. A 2003 Corps study highlighted that many harbor projects were authorized decades ago, before modern transportation alternatives were available. The Corps is responsible for maintaining small harbors mainly used by pleasure boats, funded by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest some inland projects over the years. The Corps has been allowed by Congress to divest inland waterways projects no longer needed for commercial cargo. Recent initiatives prioritize harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using data on tonnage, value, and ship transits. The Corps uses objective criteria like tonnage and cost per ton to allocate funds for commercial navigation projects. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing, public transportation, and public safety. The 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects and priorities, but no such committee has been established. Congress is concerned that the Corps' criteria for prioritizing projects are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment, as highlighted in a 2010 GAO audit. The Corps' budget process emphasizes anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, although the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) budget does reflect actual performance. The Corps' O&M budget reflects actual performance, with a focus on assessing project purposes and budget priorities based on commercial use. Opportunity cost is a key metric for efficient fund distribution to harbors, although not explicitly mentioned in budget guidance. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within national needs for optimal solutions. CRS calculations show significant cost variations in operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports on a per-ton or per-ship basis. Costs per ton and per vessel are higher at smaller ports than major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can vary yearly, and data on expenses and waterway usage have not been jointly analyzed by the Corps. The HMTF pays for maintaining harbors up to 45 feet in depth, with a non-federal sponsor responsible for 50% of costs for deeper harbors. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for maintenance of channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction, such as deepening or widening channels, is not funded through the HMTF but from general government revenues. The federal share of construction costs ranges from 40% to 80% based on harbor depth. Ports responsible for berths and private side channels cannot use HMTF money for dredging or widening. S. 601 proposes allowing ports with excess HMT revenue to use funds for dredging, removing sediments, or returning collections to shippers. H.R. 3080 proposes expanding the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging and contaminated sediments at ports. There is a disparity in HMT revenue generated by different harbors, with the top 15 ports collecting over 75% of the total revenue. Concerns about equity and efficiency arise due to the varying revenue and operation costs of individual ports. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety reasons, even if they have minimal cargo activity, with many originally authorized by Congress. The Corps identifies \"critical\" harbors of refuge for O&M funding, including subsistence harbors and those supporting Coast Guard stations. In FY2012-FY2014, additional funding was allocated for maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors by House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The Committee urges the Corps to revise criteria for navigation maintenance funding to prioritize projects with economic impact, national defense, or public safety importance. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for recreational harbors not contributing to the HMTF, shifting responsibility to state and local governments. The Reagan Administration proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo, estimated to save $150 million annually. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess fees on ships for harbor maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with a policy not to maintain harbors not extensively used for commercial navigation. Minimum appropriations in recent years aimed to prevent funds from being used on obsolete waterways. The need for continued maintenance of specific waterways and harbors was highlighted in a 1956 audit by the General Accounting Office. The audit found that the Corps was maintaining channels predominantly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their stated policy. The GAO recommended that Congress establish specific policies and criteria for determining which navigation projects should be operated and maintained at federal expense. 11 coastal navigation projects were identified as of questionable value, with only two still carrying cargo. One project, the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida, was recommended to be reclassified as a flood-control project due to its negligible navigation benefit. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was considered for reclassification as a flood-control project due to its minimal navigation benefit. Despite not being reclassified, it received around $30 million from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) from FY1999 to FY2008. In contrast, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, criticized by the GAO in 1956, received about $17 million in HMTF funds during the same period but has seen no recent cargo movement. Recent budget requests have allocated operation and maintenance expenses towards flood risk mitigation rather than navigation. Recreational boaters, although not contributing to the HMTF, have a significant economic impact, as shown by studies on the Great Lakes and Oregon harbors. The use of boat fuel taxes includes restoring fish habitat, boating safety education programs, and building boat ramps and sewage disposal facilities at marinas. Some representatives of the recreational boating industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for dredging recreational harbors. The Corps has a pilot program on the Atlantic Coast to explore local financing feasibility for waterways. However, crucial information on harbor maintenance spending is not publicly available, such as current HMTF expenditure reports. The Corps requests funds for yearly reports to Congress on harbor usage and O&M expenses. Data on cargo tonnage and vessels using waterways is collected since 1922. However, there is a discrepancy in facility nomenclature between tonnage and expenditure databases. The Corps lacks comparisons of shipping channel dimensions to authorized dimensions and economic estimates for deficiencies. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to develop tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects. Congress requested estimates on channel maintenance availability and funding needed for improvement. The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) has also provided estimates on harbor usage and O&M expenses. The Federal Maritime Commission estimates the average Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, which is small compared to cargo value but significant against freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000, with an HMT of $147 for a container of imported electronics valued at $117,606. U.S. ports near Canada and Mexico claim the HMT diverts cargo to those countries due to the lack of a similar tax. The Federal Maritime Commission estimates that removing the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) would lead to a diversion of 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee to reduce incentives for shipping through Canada. The HMT poses a serious obstacle to transshipment of cargo by sea, especially when cargo is unloaded at a U.S. port and reloaded on another ship, resulting in the HMT being levied twice. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is levied twice in a coastal feeder vessel operation, discouraging coastal feeder service. CBP and the Corps estimated $500 million per year in uncollected HMT from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, affecting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay the HMT for port use when exporting a product, but they do pay the HMT on materials and inputs transported through a coastal or Great Lakes port. The debate over WRDA is occurring in the context of heightened interest in the issue. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of increased focus on the cost-effectiveness of industrial supply chains. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are concerned about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M in FY2013 and FY2014, directing the Corps to use additional funds for harbors to promote international competitiveness. The Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to strategically improve the nation's marine transportation system and overall national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness affects the cost of products in the US and influences where companies invest and hire. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments. President Obama announced an initiative to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in 2012. The establishment of a Task Force on Ports was noted in the FY2013 Budget. In response to calls for a more strategic framework for federal investments in ports, the President established a Task Force on Ports composed of officials from various departments and White House offices."
