    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific fields or professions. Over 50 programs are authorized, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offered by the federal government forgive, cancel, or discharge a portion of an individual's student loan debt or make loan payments on their behalf. These benefits are often tied to completing a period of employment in public service or certain occupations, or as part of income-driven repayment plans. The goal is to provide financial incentives for entering public service or high-need professions, and to offer debt relief for borrowers who have not fully repaid their loans after an extended period. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offered by the federal government provide debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or certain professions, or repay their loans through income-driven repayment plans. Other forms of debt relief are available for borrowers facing specific circumstances, such as disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy discharge. The NDSL program, established in 1958, was one of the earliest federal student loan programs to offer loan forgiveness. The NDSL program, established in 1958 in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch, provided low-interest loans to college students. It also included a student loan forgiveness component aimed at increasing the number and quality of teachers in U.S. schools by canceling up to half of their student loans for full-time teaching in public schools. The NDSL program, established in 1958, provided low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in public schools. The program was later incorporated into the Higher Education Act of 1965 and renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Loan forgiveness benefits were expanded to include individuals serving in Head Start programs and in the Armed Forces. Other federal student loan forgiveness programs were established for professions in high-need areas, such as the Health Professions Student Loan Program in 1965. The Health Professions Student Loan Program (HPSLP) was modeled after the NDSL and offered loan forgiveness to medical practitioners in underserved areas. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. These programs aim to provide policymakers with general information on their purpose and operation, but for comprehensive details, readers are encouraged to refer to additional resources. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. These programs aim to provide relief to borrowers through various criteria such as service types, professions, locations, and income-driven repayment plans. Each program has unique characteristics in terms of eligibility, benefits, funding, and means of providing benefits. This overview identifies parameters to broadly characterize the authorized programs, facilitating a consistent description and examination of their benefits. In federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers must meet specific criteria to qualify for benefits. These criteria include working in certain professions or locations, or repaying according to an income-driven plan for a set period. At the end of this period, a portion of the borrower's student loan debt is forgiven or repaid. The availability of benefits may be entitlement-based or discretionary, depending on the program. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to borrowers of qualified loans, funded through mandatory appropriations. There are two categories: public service employment and income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service. Loan repayment programs differ from loan forgiveness benefits as they directly repay some or all of a borrower's student loan debt or provide funding for repayment. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or help agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. Availability is limited and subject to funding appropriation. The types of debt relief programs examined in this report vary in terms of federal income tax liability. Employment-focused loan forgiveness programs exclude forgiven debt from gross income, while income-driven repayment or public service employment forgiveness may include forgiven debt in gross income, leading to a tax liability for the borrower. Federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs include three categories of loans: federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, student loans under Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. Eligible loans for forgiveness and repayment typically include federal student loans, with some programs also including private education loans. Federal student loans were previously made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the Federal Perkins Loan program, in addition to the Direct Loan program authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Direct Loan program involves loans made by the government with federal capital, while the FFEL program involved loans made by nonfederal lenders with nonfederal capital. Loan origination, servicing, and collection activities were performed by federal contractors in the Direct Loan program, while nonprofit guaranty agencies administered federal loan insurance and processed loan forgiveness benefits in the FFEL program. During the period when the FFEL and Direct Loan programs both operated, loans were made through each program with similar borrower terms and conditions. Differences in availability of loan forgiveness benefits are noted. In the Perkins Loan program, institutions of higher education served as lenders and were responsible for originating, servicing, and processing loan cancelation benefits. In the Direct Loan program, Direct Subsidized Loans were available only to undergraduate students with financial need. Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need, subsidized by the federal government. Borrowing limits apply, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Loan proceeds can be used to cover portions of a student's cost of attendance. In FY2017, Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were made, with borrowing limits and interest payments deferred until repayment. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents and graduate students without explicit borrowing limits, totaling $12.5 billion for parents and $9.9 billion for graduate students in FY2017. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $9.9 billion were made to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan, including loans from various federal student loan programs. This feature is important for loan forgiveness and repayment programs. In FY2017, Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, allowing borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single fixed rate loan. Perkins Loans, with a fixed interest rate of 5%, were also available to students with exceptional financial need, with the possibility of loan cancellation for those in public service. Additionally, HRSA offers student loans to health professions students through various loan programs authorized under Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA. HRSA offers student loans through five programs authorized under Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA, totaling $162.8 million in loans in academic year 2016-2017. These programs include low interest rate loans for students pursuing degrees in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine, as well as fixed interest rate loans for students in allopathic or osteopathic medicine. Students receiving primary care loans must complete a residency in a primary care field. The HRSA offers student loans through various programs for students pursuing degrees in healthcare fields such as dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, allopathic or osteopathic medicine, and nursing. These programs provide low interest rate loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and are administered by individual schools. Loan recipients must fulfill service requirements in primary care fields for a specified period, or repay their loans at a higher interest rate. In the academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making a total of $39.5 million in loans across these programs. The HRSA offers student loans through various programs for healthcare fields like nursing. The program provides loans to registered nurses pursuing graduate studies to become qualified nursing school faculty. Nursing schools administer the program, selecting financially needy participants. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million. Another program, the Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL), no longer offers new loans but administers outstanding ones for degrees in medicine and dentistry. The HEAL program no longer offers new loans for healthcare degrees, but existing borrowers are still responsible for repayment. Private student loans from nonfederal entities, such as banks and state-supported programs, are also common. These loans have terms set by the lender, and some federal repayment programs may offer benefits for certain types of private loans. Debt relief programs for student loans offer various forms of assistance to eligible borrowers. These programs have unique characteristics and qualifying criteria, including types of qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, amounts and timing of debt relief, and exclusions or limitations on benefits. Program-specific details can be found in Appendix A. Debt relief programs for student loans offer various forms of assistance to eligible borrowers, categorized by loan forgiveness entitlement programs based on availability and scale. Programs range from loan forgiveness for public service to loan repayment for government employment, with specific criteria and benefits outlined. Debt relief programs for student loans offer loan forgiveness benefits for public service employment, available to qualified borrowers with specific criteria and benefits outlined in Table 1. Debt relief programs offer loan forgiveness benefits for public service employment, with specific eligibility criteria and service commitments ranging from 1 to 10 years. Borrowers must meet specific criteria, such as completing a specific type of service or entering a particular occupation. Loan forgiveness is available to teachers, law enforcement personnel, public defenders, and individuals employed in public service. Loan forgiveness programs provide debt relief to borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period. These benefits are entitlements written into the terms of federal student loans. The programs are available to a wide range of qualified borrowers and are not limited to public service employment. Table 2 summarizes the various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment, organized by eligibility start date. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources. The various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment are widely available to qualified borrowers without specific employer or occupational requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments based on factors like loan debt and income for 20-25 years, with payments capped at a percentage of discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Loan repayment for public service employment offers debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or employers. These programs are not entitlements and are subject to limited availability and program funds. Loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment are more widely available to qualified borrowers without specific employer or occupational requirements. Table 3 summarizes various loan repayment programs for meeting employment needs or shortages, detailing eligibility based on employer, occupation, and economic circumstances. Unlike Table 1, programs are organized by operational status and administering department. Table 3 illustrates 19 loan repayment programs targeting health-related occupations, legal professions, and large animal veterinarians. Borrowers can fulfill service obligations with multiple employers but may be required to work in underserved areas. Participation in these programs requires a minimum service period. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees have service commitments lasting between one and five years. These programs are tailored to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are typically smaller in scale. Information on the programs' scale is not always readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports annually on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program. Table 4 summarizes various loan repayment programs offered by federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. It outlines whether benefits are available only to borrowers employed by a single agency or by federal government employers. Table 4 summarizes federal loan repayment programs for government employees, highlighting eligibility criteria, operational status, and administering departments. These programs aim to recruit and retain qualified employees, with some specifically targeting Armed Forces members. There are 25 programs in total, with varying levels of availability across federal agencies. Federal loan repayment programs for government employees vary in availability at federal agencies. Benefits may be open to any employee or specific occupations within an agency. Service commitments typically range from one to five years, with eligibility sometimes based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing. Federal loan repayment programs for government employees vary in availability at federal agencies, with benefits based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing. Programs consider factors like qualifying types of service and borrower's background. Benefits can include forgiving the entire loan balance, repaying a flat dollar amount, or a percentage of the outstanding loan. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans by requiring a certain number of payments towards the balance. Employers may also provide repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount or a percentage of the outstanding loans. Some programs have restrictions on benefits availability, especially for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans. Certain federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions that prevent borrowers who have defaulted on their loans from receiving benefits. Some programs require U.S. citizenship for eligibility and may penalize borrowers who do not complete their service term. Additionally, individuals cannot benefit from multiple programs for the same service, such as the Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program overlapping with other forgiveness programs. Certain federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions based on citizenship and immigration status. Programs may require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. For example, federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to specified eligible noncitizens. Availability of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits is restricted based on borrower's citizenship and immigration status at the time of obtaining the loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits in federal programs may be limited for borrowers in default. Eligibility for benefits in certain programs depends on defaulted loan characteristics. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, teacher loan forgiveness is generally unavailable for defaulted loans, but forgiveness may be possible with satisfactory repayment arrangements. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, forgiveness terms vary for defaulted loans based on acceleration status. Clawback provisions may require repayment if service obligations are not met. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to repay unearned benefits, with some also including interest and punitive fees. Certain programs exempt borrowers from repayment in cases of disability or death. Student loan forgiveness and repayment may be taxable, but some programs exclude these benefits from gross income for tax purposes. Loan forgiveness or repayment benefits under federal programs may be excluded from gross income for tax purposes if certain conditions are met, such as borrowing for education, working in specified professions, and loans made by certain lenders. Specific exclusions apply to programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs under the Public Health Service Act. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may not be excluded from income for tax purposes if certain conditions are not met. Some programs provide funds to offset tax liability from loan discharge. Excluding these benefits from gross income can save recipients from significant taxation. However, there is debate on the effectiveness of these programs in encouraging borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Researchers explore three main issues in determining the impact of these programs. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs is analyzed based on whether they influence individuals to enter or stay in certain fields, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if the programs lead to increased borrowing. The cost to the federal government is also considered. The influence of loan forgiveness and repayment programs on an individual's employment choice is analyzed by comparing career paths of recipients with those without access to such benefits. The National Institutes of Health found that recipients were more likely to continue medical research at the NIH. The study found that individuals who received loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue medical research at the NIH, suggesting the program may be meeting its goals. However, other research indicates that some individuals would have pursued these careers regardless of loan repayments, potentially making the program unnecessary in certain circumstances. Law school graduates facing limited private sector opportunities may opt for public interest or government jobs. Some individuals who accept loan repayment for a specific job may have taken the job even without the benefit. For example, healthcare providers in rural areas would have practiced there regardless of loan repayment. The NIH found that loan repayment was a key factor in attracting physicians with competing job offers, leading to higher retention rates in research positions. Loan repayment programs can serve as a recruitment and retention tool for federal agencies. Loan repayment programs can be effective recruitment and retention tools for federal agencies. However, the uncertainty of funding for discretionary programs and the insufficient incentive of loan repayment amounts may undermine their effectiveness. To improve recruitment and retention, the financial benefits should be meaningful enough to offset the costs of pursuing postsecondary education. Loan repayment programs can be effective recruitment and retention tools for federal agencies. However, additional program design elements such as tax liabilities and short-term nature of the programs may make the benefits less attractive for individuals, leading to turnover and a less stable workforce for employers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are based on the assumption that student loan debt influences career choices, but research shows that factors like compensation and personal preferences also play a role. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians in primary care, but other reasons like specialty focus or administrative duties may deter them from entering this field. Some individuals may be deterred from entering primary care due to increased administrative duties or a preference for a specialty field. Debt levels can also impact career decisions, especially for certain racial and ethnic groups. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available to those not influenced by debt in career choice, but the financial incentives may not fully compensate for the lower lifetime earnings in primary care compared to specialty fields. Debt levels can influence job choices, leading graduates to opt for higher-paying positions in the private sector over lower-paying roles in education, government, or non-profit organizations. However, demographic factors may also play a significant role in career decisions, potentially overshadowing the impact of loan repayment programs on career choices. The effects of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs on career choices of law school graduates are debated. Some argue that these programs may encourage students to take on more student loan debt, as monthly payments are tied to income and not the amount owed. This could potentially lead to the forgiveness of the entire outstanding balance after certain conditions are met. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may encourage student over-borrowing and make students less sensitive to the cost of education. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incur costs to the federal government, including loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. The federal student loan programs consist of federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees, funded through mandatory appropriations. Costs are measured based on estimated long-term costs to the government. The federal budget reflects the subsidy cost of loans and administrative costs separately. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a return. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers in the Direct Loan program. Loan forgiveness benefits relieve borrowers of repaying a portion of their loans, leading to increased loan subsidy costs for the program. These benefits, like those in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and income-based repayment plans, are factored into subsidy costs for the fiscal year the loan was made. Direct costs of borrower benefits in loan repayment programs are funded separately from subsidy rates. Funding for loan repayment programs can come from discretionary or mandatory appropriations, affecting loan subsidy costs. Availability of benefits depends on appropriations and funding constraints. Examples include GESLR, JRJ, and NHSCLRP funded through discretionary appropriations, and Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits funded uniquely through loan terms. Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria for loan forgiveness. The Perkins Loan program offers loan forgiveness, funded uniquely through loan terms, not federal credit programs. Institutions absorb costs of loan cancellation without federal reimbursement. ED maintains reimbursement records for eligible institutions. Funding for Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits was last appropriated in FY2009. Loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs are funded through discretionary or mandatory appropriations on a fiscal year basis. Administrative costs are accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government, with estimates provided for future loan forgiveness benefits. Loan repayment programs are administered by various agencies with varying funding mechanisms. Loan repayment programs provide information on benefits provided and recipients. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are discussed, with specific data on debt relief and recipients available for some programs. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated government costs were $1.5 billion over five years. Estimates for the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan are also discussed. In the 2015 Final Regulation, the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan estimated that approximately 6 million borrowers would be eligible, with 2 million choosing to enroll, costing $15.4 billion. The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) repayment plan in a 2012 NPRM estimated a cost of $2.1 billion over 10 years, with 1.67 million borrowers opting for PAYE. Approximately 400,000 borrowers would receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment, with an average original loan balance of $39,500. In the 2012 NPRM, ED estimated that approximately 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would elect to repay their loans according to the IBR plan. For pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers, 126,000 borrowers from the FY2009 loan cohort were estimated to repay their loans according to IBR, with 44,000 having some portion of their student loan debt forgiven after 25 years. For the FY2012 cohort, 146,000 borrowers were estimated to repay according to the IBR plan, with 52,000 having some debt forgiven after 25 years. Loan forgiveness benefits are difficult to precisely estimate due to borrower repayment behavior and labor market experiences. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of existing federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Questions may arise regarding the structure of these programs, potential overlaps, and whether they lead to unintended financial benefits for borrowers. It is challenging to estimate the overall benefits of loan forgiveness due to various factors such as borrower behavior and labor market conditions. The federal government may be spending money on administrative costs for multiple programs serving the same purpose, potentially allowing individuals to qualify for benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed. This could lead to unintended financial benefits for borrowers, such as receiving loan repayment benefits and forgiveness of student loan debt concurrently. The federal government may fund multiple programs serving the same purpose, potentially allowing individuals to receive benefits from different sources for the same service. For example, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase qualified nursing faculty and are administered by HRSA. However, NFLRP grants money to nursing schools to establish their own loan repayment programs. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) grants money to nursing schools to establish loan repayment programs for individuals. This may create an administrative burden on HRSA if it administers both NELRP and NFLRP, which serve the same purpose. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that provide double benefits or target the same group of individuals. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields, but they may also benefit individuals who would have entered those fields regardless of the incentives available. Some concerns have been raised about loan forgiveness programs, particularly regarding the possibility of individuals borrowing larger amounts knowing that forgiveness is an option. Congress may need to consider establishing limits on forgiveness amounts. Research suggests that individuals may choose certain fields even without loan forgiveness incentives. Loan repayment programs may be ineffective if skilled employees are already seeking employment in specified fields. However, they may be somewhat effective in creating career pipelines or retaining skilled employees. Congress could improve program effectiveness by implementing more specific funding controls. Insufficient data are available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for federal loan forgiveness programs like PSLF, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. Borrowers must meet specific criteria over a 10-year period to qualify for forgiveness benefits, with little known about actual forgiveness benefits received. Future participation projections are challenging due to the optional documentation of employment in public service jobs. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans. Loan forgiveness programs like PSLF have limited data available, making it hard to assess their effectiveness. Borrowers must meet specific criteria over a 10-year period to qualify for forgiveness benefits. Data collection on participants is minimal, making it difficult to determine program effects. Improved data collection may be necessary to assess program outcomes and effectiveness. Variations exist in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief in different programs. Debt relief programs vary in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify. Some programs have specific limitations, while others have fewer restrictions. Concerns have been raised about over-borrowing due to the availability of certain repayment or forgiveness programs. Consideration is needed on imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for these programs. Debt relief programs for federal student loans vary in selection criteria among agencies. In 2016, 34 federal agencies provided loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP, requiring participants to serve for at least three years. Repayment programs may not be available in all agencies, leading to unpredictability in criteria. The GESLRP offers loan repayment benefits to federal employees, with restrictions on who can receive benefits based on their position. Different agencies have varying eligibility criteria, leading to confusion for participants. The program aims to attract qualified individuals to work in the federal government but may only appeal to those in agencies that administer the program. The report provides detailed information on various federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, including statutory citations, program purposes, eligible loans, qualifying service requirements, benefit amounts, eligibility restrictions, tax treatment, budget classification, appropriations, loan discharges, program beneficiaries, and additional resources. The data is sourced from statutes, regulations, agency websites, and authoritative sources.

Borrowers can defer payments during qualifying service. Perkins Loan cancellation is based on years of service in specific public service occupations. A complete year of service consists of 12 consecutive months, except for teaching service where a full academic year is considered. Loan cancellation may not be provided for the same service used to qualify for AmeriCorps education awards. Funding for Perkins Loan cancellations is classified as discretionary for congressional budget purposes. Amounts discharged or repaid information is currently unavailable. Student Financial Aid Programs Under the Higher Education Act focus on loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment plans, providing debt relief to borrowers based on their income proportion. These benefits are entitlements for qualified borrowers and are not tied to specific occupations or services. The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) program is authorized by the Higher Education Act and federal regulations. The Direct Loan program offers borrowers the opportunity to make payments based on their federal student loan debt, family size, and income, with any remaining balance forgiven after 25 years. Eligible loans include Subsidized, Unsubsidized, PLUS, and Consolidation Loans. Borrowers must make payments for 25 years to qualify for forgiveness benefits.
