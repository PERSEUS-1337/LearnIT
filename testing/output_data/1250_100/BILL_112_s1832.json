    "content": "The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally, regardless of the transaction method, and collect taxes owed under State law. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally for all sellers, with or without small seller exceptions, for remote sales sourced to the State. Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement can enforce this immediately after 90 days of enactment, while non-Member States can do so after implementing minimum simplification requirements, starting at least 6 months after enacting legislation. The State must enact legislation to implement minimum simplification requirements for sales and use tax laws, including a single State-level agency for administration, a uniform tax base, and requiring remote sellers to collect taxes. Consolidated providers must collect sales and use taxes based on the destination rate, which includes the State and local jurisdiction rates. They need to offer software and services to remote sellers to determine the correct tax rate and provide certification procedures. Remote sellers using single or consolidated providers are held harmless for any errors in tax calculations. Remote sellers using single or consolidated providers are protected from liability for errors made by the provider. They are also not held accountable for collecting incorrect sales or use tax amounts if they relied on information provided by the State. Additionally, they must be given a 30-day notice of any rate changes by localities in the State. Local rate changes can only take effect at the beginning of a calendar quarter, and failure to provide notice requires the State and locality to hold the seller or provider harmless for collecting tax at the previous rate for 30 days. Small sellers with gross annual receipts exceeding $500,000 in total remote sales are required to collect sales or use tax. Sales from related persons must be aggregated to determine if the threshold is met. SEC. 4.
