    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is made regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined as the biodiesel mixture credit, which is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for different blends of qualified biodiesel mixture. The rates vary for B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends. The biodiesel fuels credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture rate for different blends, such as B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends. The applicable amount for each blend is calculated based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used by the taxpayer in their trade or business. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the biodiesel fuels credit. The term 'biodiesel' refers to monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils for use in diesel engines. It includes esters from various vegetable oils like corn, soybeans, and sunflower seeds. Registration requirements must be met for biodiesel to qualify for the credit. The Environmental Protection Agency sets requirements for fuels and additives under the Clean Air Act. If biodiesel is separated from a qualified mixture or used for purposes other than fuel, a tax is imposed based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons. The tax imposed on biodiesel fuels is subject to applicable laws and penalties as if imposed under a different section. Taxpayers can elect to not apply for the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year within a 3-year period. The biodiesel fuels credit is subject to regulations set by the Secretary. Section 38(b) is amended to include the biodiesel fuels credit as part of the general business credit. Conforming amendments are made to sections 39(d) and 196(c) to restrict carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit, determined under section 40A, is added to the general business credit under section 38(b). Amendments are made to restrict carryback of the credit before January 1, 2003. The amendments made by section 40A apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. Reduction of motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures is addressed in section 3. The amendment to Section 4081 introduces a new subsection regarding the tax rate for biodiesel mixtures. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced under certain conditions. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced under certain conditions, as defined in section 40A.

Transfers will be made from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Highway Trust Fund to offset reductions in receipts due to amendments made by the Act. Estimates will be made by the Secretary of the Treasury and adjustments will be made for any errors in the estimates."
