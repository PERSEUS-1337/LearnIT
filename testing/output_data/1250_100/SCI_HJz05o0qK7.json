    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but there is a lack of general-purpose tools for this in the machine learning literature. A procedure for evaluating compositionality by measuring how well a model can approximate true representations is described. This procedure helps characterize compositional structure in various settings and explores its relationship with learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The text discusses the evaluation of compositionality in learned representations, particularly in a communication game scenario. It explores the structure of learned codes and the emergence of compositionality in learning problems. The success of representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations. The text discusses the need for a standardized technique to evaluate compositional structure in learned representations, focusing on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known. This evaluation paradigm covers existing representation learning problems where compositionality is a key factor. The paper introduces a formal framework for evaluating compositionality in representations, proposing an evaluation metric called TRE. It aims to find an explicitly compositional model that reflects the true model by optimizing over primitive meaning representations. The second contribution is a survey of applications demonstrating the assessment of compositionality in representations.

It aims to find a compositional model by optimizing over primitive meaning representations. The second contribution is a survey of applications aimed at answering key questions about the relationship between compositionality and learning. The paper discusses a compositional encoding scheme and various approaches for compositional representation learning. It explores when and how compositionality emerges in models without explicit composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy evaluate compositionality in formal and natural languages, but applying these techniques to non-string-valued representation spaces is challenging. Machine learning research is addressing this gap by developing procedures for assessing compositionality in a general context. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of compositionality evaluations in various ways. One class derives judgments from manual analyses of representation spaces, while another exploits task-specific structure to provide evidence of compositionality. Our work aims to offer a standard and scalable alternative to these evaluations. Other authors base analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and generalization to novel inputs. Our approach examines how these surrogate measures track stricter notions of compositionality. The curr_chunk discusses the validation of an approach in natural language processing for compositional representation learning. It emphasizes the agnostic nature of the approach towards composition functions and the use of existing NLP techniques for evaluating data. The communication task involving a speaker and listener model is also mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses an automated procedure for determining if representations produced by a model reflect the structure of input objects. It defines a representation learning problem with observations, representations, and a model. The technique proposed assumes prior knowledge about the task the representations are used for. The curr_chunk discusses the assumption of prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs in a technique proposed for representation learning. It focuses on the concept of compositionality in linguistic contexts. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of identifying lexicon entries and dealing with languages that do not fit the homomorphism condition in compositionality. It also mentions the process of composing primitive representations to produce full representations. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation procedure for measuring compositionality, focusing on Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) as a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7. The evaluation procedure for measuring compositionality focuses on Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) as a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7, aiming to capture the constructability of representations from parts. The evaluation procedure for measuring compositionality focuses on Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) as a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7. The function * is defined with free parameters and optimized jointly with \u03b7 i, with care needed to avoid trivial solutions. Experiments in the paper involve * in both fixed and learned parametric forms, with implementation details for models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4. Equation 2 can be solved using gradient descent, and for discrete \u0398, a continuous relaxation may be possible. The paper discusses the use of Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) as a compositional approximation in machine learning problems. It explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, focusing on the information bottleneck theory of representation learning. The compression phase aims to find a compositional representation by isolating decision-relevant attributes and discarding irrelevant information. The paper also presents a meta-learning framework for predicting classifiers in various sub-tasks. In a meta-learning framework, classifiers are trained to determine if a test image matches a given visual concept. Visual concepts are single attributes or conjunctions of attributes like background color and digit identity. The model achieves 75.2% validation accuracy on a dataset of 9000 image triplets. The model achieves 75.2% validation accuracy on average over ten training runs. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. Both quantities increase and decrease together after mutual information reaches a maximum, indicating a high degree of compositionality. The results suggest that compression in the information bottleneck framework is linked to discovering compositional representations. The study focuses on the compositional nature of individual phrase representations, with low reconstruction error indicating compositional meaning. This analysis differs by using TRE to search for atomic representations in natural language processing tasks. The study aims to validate a new approach in language processing by training word and bigram embeddings using CBOW objective. It explores the compositional structure of phrase embeddings and compares them with human judgments on noun-noun compounds. The analysis focuses on discovering atomic representations in natural language processing tasks. The study validates a new language processing approach by training word and bigram embeddings using CBOW objective. It compares these embeddings with human judgments on noun-noun compounds, showing an anticorrelation between TRE and compositionality ratings. Topographic similarity is introduced to analyze the relationship between learned representations and their associated derivations. The relationship between derivations and distance functions is explored, with a focus on tree edit distance as a metric. Proposition 1 states that the tree edit distance is an upper bound on any distance metric satisfying certain properties. This implies that representations cannot be significantly farther apart than the derivations that produce them. In Appendix B, proof is provided that small tree edit distance is not enough for topographic similarity. Compositionality imposes constraints on inferences from similarity judgments. The relationship between compositionality and generalization is investigated in communication games. Training agents from random initial conditions shows the impact of compositional language on performance with familiar and novel objects. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where a speaker and a listener model communicate using discrete codes to reconstruct target objects. Policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective, and both models are implemented with RNNs. Each target referent consists of two objects with two attributes each. The experiment involves a reference game where models communicate using discrete codes to reconstruct target objects. Each object has two attributes, and a subset of object pairs is held out for evaluation. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes with complex semantics. Agent messages are represented as one-hot vectors, with a composition function involving free parameters.

Agent messages are represented as one-hot vectors, with a composition function involving free parameters. The input string cannot affect the choice of tokens, allowing modeling of non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages show lower absolute performance, even in successful training runs. Two languages resulting from multiagent training runs have different TRE but induce similar listener performance. TRE is computed via gradient descent, allowing arbitrary vectors for elements of D0. Both \u03b4 and * have subgradients and can be optimized using the same procedure as preceding sections. 100 speaker-listener pairs are trained with random initial parameters, and results are measured. The study trained 100 speaker-listener pairs with random initial parameters and measured their performance on training and test sets. Results suggest a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization. TRE is correlated with generalization error but also with absolute model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages often result from poor communication strategies. Low TRE does not necessarily lead to poor generalization, as some languages achieve good generalization performance at both low and high levels of compositionality. The study introduced a new evaluation method called TRE for assessing compositional structure in representation learning. TRE infers primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measures the quality of this approximation. The analysis was applied to various representation learning problems, exploring compositionality in learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization. Future research aims to generalize TRE to settings without oracle derivations and hopes to provide new tools for understanding machine learning models and problems.
