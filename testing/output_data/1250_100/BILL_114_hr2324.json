The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines key terms like \"adjacent landholder,\" \"Director concerned,\" and \"eligible Federal lands parcel,\" which refers to specific criteria for parcels of National Forest System land or public lands eligible for purchase by non-Federal entities. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines terms like \"exceptional resource\" and \"Indian tribe,\" specifying criteria for public lands and National Forest System parcels. The \"National Forest System land\" includes land within the National Forest System, excluding certain areas like national monuments, wilderness areas, and national scenic areas. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management, such as national monuments, wilderness areas, and land held in trust for Indian tribes. The term \"Regional Forester concerned\" refers to the Regional Forester overseeing National Forest System land. The selection of parcels for conveyance can be done in response to a request from an adjacent landholder or upon recommendation from the Bureau of Land Management or National Forest System. Adjacent landholders can request to purchase eligible Federal lands parcels through a process created by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior. The process for conveying Federal land must align with existing public purchase request processes, be open to the public, and available online within 90 days of enactment. When an adjacent landholder requests conveyance of National Forest System land, the Director or Regional Forester must review the parcel within 30 days to determine eligibility. The Director or Regional Forester must review adjacent landholder requests for National Forest System land conveyance within 30 days to determine eligibility. If the parcel fails to meet the criteria, the landowner will receive a written explanation detailing the reasons for rejection. The Federal Government must maintain ownership of the parcel and be the best steward. Parcel conveyed cannot exceed 160 acres without approval. Adjacent landholders limited to one parcel per year, unless under 160 acres. Conveyance process outlined. The conveyance process for eligible Federal lands parcels involves providing public notice of availability, negotiating sales with single adjacent landholders, and handling sales with multiple adjacent landholders. The sale of eligible public lands parcels must be conducted through competitive bidding procedures. Offers that do not meet the minimum consideration required may be rejected, with the opportunity for appeal. Purchasers must agree to comply with local land use ordinances and zoning plans. When eligible Federal lands parcels are sold, the Director or Regional Forester will convey all rights, including mineral estate, through a quitclaim deed. An appeals process is available if a request or offer is rejected, using an expedited Forest Service appeals process. In section 322(d) of Public Law 102-381, references to the Chief of the Forest Service or the Secretary of Agriculture are interpreted as the Director concerned or the Regional Forester concerned. For the sale of eligible Federal lands parcels, a cash payment equal to the fair market value, including the mineral estate, must be made. The fair market value is determined by an appraisal submitted by the adjacent landholder, unless rejected within 45 days by the Director or Regional Forester. The Director or Regional Forester will conduct another appraisal within 30 days as per regulations. Proceeds from the conveyance of eligible Federal lands will be collected and deposited into a special Treasury fund. These funds will be distributed annually to States where the Federal Government owns over 33% of the land area. Under this section, 50 percent of funds collected from a conveyance go to the State where it occurred, and the remaining 50 percent is split equally among other States. States receiving funds must use them to purchase eligible Federal lands or comply with specific Federal requirements. The Director or Regional Forester must require the purchaser to pay for conveyance costs, including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. Any excess amount collected must be refunded to the purchaser. The conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels should be completed within 18 months. Conveyances under this section are categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements. Refunds for excess amounts collected must be given to the purchaser. The conveyance authority provided by this section is in addition to the sale authority provided by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or any other provision of law."
