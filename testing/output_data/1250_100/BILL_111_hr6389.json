    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant health concern, being the second leading cause of cancer death among men. In 2009, over 190,000 new cases were diagnosed, resulting in more than 27,000 deaths. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer. The disease can affect younger men and has racial disparities, with African-Americans having higher mortality rates. Underserved rural populations face higher mortality rates, and utilizing telehealth for diagnosis and treatment is recommended. Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment by urologists are crucial, but many questions remain unanswered. The causes of prostate cancer are unknown, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. There is a lack of accurate tests to differentiate between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease, resulting in significant overtreatment. No treatments can cure metastasized prostate cancer. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify and implement best practices for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease, leading to less physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for men and their families. Additionally, billions of dollars could be saved in healthcare systems. Prostate cancer coordination and education are essential for improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, leading to reduced trauma for patients and cost savings in healthcare systems. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force within 180 days. The Task Force is responsible for summarizing advances in prostate cancer research, compiling best practices for health care programs, considering guidance for screening men over 74, and coordinating information on Federal research and health care activities. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force is tasked with improving research and health care programs, identifying gaps, promoting research translation, and maximizing collaboration and resources. They also develop a strategy for collaborative research programs to study factors related to prostate cancer etiology and innovative scientific opportunities. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to address research gaps, develop key research questions, ensure consistent action, coordinate messages on screening and treatment, and make recommendations for improving research programs within federal agencies. The Prostate Cancer Task Force focuses on strategic planning, eliminating duplication in research and health care programs across federal agencies, increasing public participation, disseminating information on research progress, and expanding partnerships between public and private entities. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to encourage collaborative research and health care delivery, assess cost savings, identify priority action items, and determine funding needs for implementing recommendations. Task Force members include representatives from relevant federal agencies to coordinate a unified message on prostate cancer screening and treatment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force appoints expert advisory panels from various organizations and convenes meetings at least twice a year. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs submits recommendations to Congress based on input from the panels. Veterans Affairs must submit recommendations to Congress from the Secretary based on input from expert advisory panels appointed by the Prostate Cancer Task Force. The Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Task Force, with an exception regarding the termination of advisory committees. SEC. 4. PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with other departments, will establish a program to intensify prostate cancer research. This program will focus on developing better diagnostic methods, understanding the causes of the disease, and expanding basic research into prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Advisory Board will accelerate research data sharing and the movement of new medicines to patients. The Underserved Minority Grant Program aims to address racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer research. The Prostate Cancer Advisory Board will focus on racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, barriers to care and clinical trial participation for underserved minorities, outreach and educational efforts in affected communities, and access to imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved areas, prioritizing African-Americans, Latin-Americans, American Indians, and rural populations. Eligible entities will be selected to participate in these projects. The Secretary will evaluate the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer in underserved areas through telehealth services, improving nonmedical providers' capacity, and using telehealth for prostate cancer treatment. The Secretary will evaluate the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer in underserved areas through telehealth services, including the use of tumor boards for patient counseling. A report on the outcomes of pilot projects will be submitted to Congress, detailing cost savings, efficiencies, and recommendations for expanding telehealth services. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, focusing on encouraging men to seek screening. The campaign will target communities with racial disparities and men with a family history of prostate cancer. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit entities for testing outreach and education strategies. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 to carry out the Act."
