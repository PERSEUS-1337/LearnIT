    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions receiving federal funding. The statute prohibits discrimination based on sex and holds schools liable for a deliberately indifferent response to such incidents. Federal agencies like the Department of Education enforce Title IX, allowing for private rights of action against schools in certain circumstances. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex-based discrimination at federally-funded educational institutions. Compliance with Title IX is a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program. All operations of schools or institutions receiving federal funds are covered by Title IX. The statute does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, but the Department of Education has issued guidance on addressing these issues. The Department of Education has issued guidance on schools' responsibilities under Title IX for addressing sexual harassment allegations. Educational institutions have developed procedures to investigate and respond to such allegations. Recently, ED proposed new regulations that would change institutions' responsibilities in responding to sexual harassment. This report provides background on how federal courts and agencies have interpreted Title IX requirements. The report focuses on ED's guidance for schools on responding to sexual harassment and assault allegations, along with constitutional challenges against universities. It examines proposed regulations altering schools' Title IX responsibilities, which prohibit sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. The statute does not provide a private right of action for victims of sex discrimination or expressly prohibit sexual harassment. Title IX does not explicitly prohibit sexual harassment or define unlawful sexual abuse. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims seeking relief under Title IX through a private right of action. The Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to allow for a private right of action against federally funded educational institutions for sexual harassment and has created the legal standard for liability in cases of sexual abuse or harassment by teachers or students. The judicially created liability standard under Title IX requires educational institutions to respond to sexual harassment or abuse with deliberate indifference for liability. The private right of action for damages is based on the recipient's response to the conduct, not solely on the occurrence of harassment or abuse. This right is implied by the Court and provides a legal remedy for victims of sex discrimination. The Supreme Court has set out requirements for establishing an educational funding recipient's liability under Title IX for damages for sexual abuse or harassment, based on the institution's \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to such conduct. This means that educational institutions are not strictly liable for a teacher's sexual harassment or abuse of a student, as the liability standard focuses on the institution's response to the conduct. The Supreme Court established that educational institutions are not automatically liable for teacher misconduct under Title IX. Liability is based on the institution's response to known misconduct, requiring a showing of deliberate indifference. The Court considered legislative intent and administrative enforcement provisions in creating this standard. The Supreme Court ruled that educational institutions are not automatically liable for teacher misconduct under Title IX. Liability is determined by the institution's response to known misconduct, requiring a showing of deliberate indifference. The Court emphasized the need for \"actual notice\" to establish liability for damages in a private right of action under Title IX. The Court ruled that a school district is not automatically liable under Title IX for teacher misconduct. Liability depends on the institution's response to known misconduct, requiring a showing of deliberate indifference. The standard of deliberate indifference is high and must cause students to undergo harassment or make them vulnerable to it. The response must be clearly unreasonable in light of the circumstances to establish liability. The plaintiff must show that the funding recipient's response to sexual abuse or harassment was clearly unreasonable to establish liability under Title IX. Before proving \"deliberate indifference,\" the plaintiff must demonstrate that an appropriate person at the recipient had actual knowledge of discrimination. Failure to show this may result in the dismissal of a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual harassment or abuse. The Gebser standard defines an \"appropriate person\" as an official with authority to address discrimination. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires showing substantial control over the harasser, severe and pervasive harassment, and denial of educational access. Davis limits liability to situations where the recipient had substantial control over the harasser. The Court in Davis emphasized the recipient's authority to take \"remedial action\" against harassment, which must take place in a context subject to the school district's control. The plaintiff must show that the harassment is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, effectively denying equal access to educational resources. Surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships are considered, including the ages of the harasser and victim. The Court also noted that evidence of a decline in grades may indicate the harassment's impact on the victim's education. The Court emphasized the need for evidence of a decline in grades to show the impact of harassment on education. Harassment under Title IX must have a systemic effect of denying equal access to education. Liability for sexual abuse or harassment requires a showing of deliberate indifference by the educational program. Lower courts vary in their interpretation of evidence needed for a Title IX claim. Some courts interpret Title IX claims differently, focusing on elements like \"actual\" notice of discrimination, \"deliberate indifference\", and impact on equal access to resources. Courts also require evidence of severe, pervasive harassment for student-to-student claims. Federal courts of appeals have varying interpretations. Federal courts of appeals have varying interpretations on what constitutes \"actual\" notice of discrimination under Title IX claims. Some courts require evidence of severe, pervasive harassment, while others focus on specific allegations or knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse. The failure to satisfy any element may result in the dismissal of a Title IX claim. Some courts differentiate between evidence establishing actual notice of sexual abuse by a teacher versus sexual violence or harassment by a student. In a case, complaints from two students about a teacher's sexual misconduct raised a triable issue of the principal's actual notice of a pattern of harassment. The analysis of \"actual notice\" may consider knowledge of the risk of abuse or harassment, where even lesser harassment can indicate notice of sexually violent conduct. In Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit found that the school principal did not have \"actual\" notice of a sixth grade teacher sexually abusing a student, despite prior reports of misconduct. The principal had been warned by former students, teachers, and the school librarian about the teacher's inappropriate behavior, but the court determined that this did not constitute actual notice. The court found the principal's behavior inappropriate but stated there was no evidence he was aware of the student abuse. Courts vary on what constitutes \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability. The standard requires notice to an appropriate person with authority to address discrimination. Courts determine \"appropriate person[s]\" based on ability to address misconduct or represent the funding recipient. In school cases, varying opinions exist on who qualifies, such as principals, teachers, or guidance counselors. Some courts consider a principal as an \"appropriate person\" with authority to investigate discrimination. In Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit ruled that a school principal may not always be considered an \"appropriate person\" to address misconduct due to limitations in authority. Additionally, in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District, the Fifth Circuit held that a school official who directly engages in sexual abuse cannot be deemed an \"appropriate person\" under Gebser, even if they would otherwise qualify. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school principal who sexually abused a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, as it is unlikely they would take corrective action or report their own behavior. The court also rejected the argument that the principal's abuse should be treated as an official action of the school district for Title IX liability purposes. In similar cases in higher education, courts have analyzed whether university employees qualify as \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX private right of action based on specific evidence. In cases involving Title IX private right of action, courts analyze evidence related to individuals' roles in the university hierarchy and their ability to address misconduct. The Tenth Circuit ruled that campus security officers were not \"appropriate persons\" for reporting sexual assaults, as their actions were seen as clerical rather than corrective. The variability in court analyses makes it difficult to determine who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. The determination of who may constitute an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX is subject to variability in court analyses. Courts consider characteristics indicative of an \"appropriate person\" and evidence of their responsibilities in the institution. To establish liability, a plaintiff must prove deliberate indifference in the funding recipient's response, which requires more than negligence or failure to act reasonably. Federal appellate courts interpret this standard as necessitating a response that is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. In determining deliberate indifference under Title IX, courts analyze the recipient's response to allegations of sexual harassment or abuse. The response must not be clearly unreasonable, such as failing to investigate serious allegations or take disciplinary action. Federal case law sets a high bar for proving deliberate indifference, with divergent interpretations on what constitutes an adequate response. In a case involving a school district, the Fifth Circuit found that despite evidence of a deficient response to allegations of sexual abuse by a teacher, it did not amount to deliberate indifference. The plaintiffs alleged that the teacher had abused male students over four years, but the court determined that the principal's actions, including interviewing the student and warning the teacher, were not inadequate. The Eleventh Circuit found that the school's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct was inadequate. Despite receiving complaints from two students about the same teacher, the principal failed to take appropriate action, leading to a possible pattern of misconduct being ignored. The court concluded that the school's response was deliberately indifferent. The Eleventh Circuit criticized the school's inadequate response to teacher sexual misconduct complaints, deeming it deliberately indifferent. Some courts have addressed similar issues, like in Simpson v. University of Colorado, where a university's failure to prevent sexual assault during football recruiting visits was seen as deliberate indifference. The court highlighted evidence of prior knowledge of sexual assaults by football players and recruits at the university. The head coach resisted recruiting reforms and players lacked guidance on appropriate behavior. The evidence suggested the head coach had knowledge of assaults but did not make changes to prevent them. The court found evidence of prior sexual assaults by football players and recruits at the university, indicating deliberate indifference. Title IX enforcement includes private rights of action and federal agency oversight for nondiscrimination in educational programs receiving federal funds. Agencies enforce Title IX by issuing regulations and monitoring compliance with the statute. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice play key roles in enforcing Title IX, with the Secretary of Education responsible for regulations on sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal assistance, and the Attorney General coordinating enforcement across the executive branch. OCR collaborates in enforcing Title IX through a memorandum of understanding with primary responsibility for investigating complaints and ensuring compliance. Regulations bar educational institutions from sex-based discrimination and require the designation of a Title IX Coordinator. Grievance procedures must provide prompt resolution of complaints. OCR may conduct periodic reviews of institutions. OCR enforces Title IX by conducting periodic reviews or investigations to ensure compliance with federal requirements. Complaints alleging violations of Title IX are investigated, and informal resolutions can be sought through a resolution agreement. If no agreement is reached, formal enforcement measures, such as funding suspension or termination, may be pursued. Title IX does not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR's guidance documents interpret it to prohibit such behavior and outline responsibilities for educational institutions. These guidelines differ from Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for sexual abuse damages. The Department of Education (ED) has established guidelines for schools to respond to sexual harassment under Title IX, including a constructive notice requirement. Unlike Supreme Court case law, ED holds schools responsible for harassment by teachers and prohibits sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination. OCR's guidance outlines responsibilities for educational institutions to comply with Title IX and address complaints of violations. The Department of Education has guidelines for schools to respond to sexual harassment under Title IX, including quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. Schools can be liable for harassment by employees or other students if it creates a hostile or abusive educational environment. Under Title IX, schools can be held liable for sexual harassment if a hostile environment exists, the school is aware of the harassment, and fails to take corrective action. The Supreme Court set a different standard for liability in cases of harassment by teachers, requiring actual knowledge and deliberate indifference by the school district. The Supreme Court set a standard for liability in Title IX damages suits for sexual harassment, requiring a showing of actual knowledge, deliberate indifference, and conduct that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive. The Court distinguished between actions that could result in liability for damages and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies. Agencies have the authority to enforce Title IX requirements, even if they do not define discrimination under the statute. In response to the standard for liability in Title IX damages suits alleging sexual harassment, ED issued guidance documents reaffirming its position outlined in its 1997 Guidance. The liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations differs from the administrative enforcement context, as indicated by ED. OCR also issued a Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance document in 2001, reaffirming the agency's standards grounded in Title IX regulations for educational institutions. The guidance on Title IX compliance standards for educational institutions receiving federal funds emphasizes the need for prompt and equitable resolution of sexual harassment complaints. Schools must take effective action to end harassment, prevent recurrence, and remedy its effects. The 1997 and 2001 documents, while framed as guidance, were issued by the Department of Education after public input. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX compliance standards for educational institutions emphasized the importance of addressing sexual harassment promptly and equitably. It defined sexual harassment as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" and highlighted the key issue of whether the harassment limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program based on sex. The guidance outlined types of harassment, including quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX compliance standards emphasized addressing sexual harassment promptly and equitably. It defined sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program based on sex. Hostile environment harassment requires further investigation into the seriousness of the conduct, especially when it involves students or employees creating a hostile environment. OCR examines all relevant circumstances, including whether the conduct was welcome, to determine if hostile environment harassment has occurred. In cases of harassment by teachers or employees towards students, schools are responsible for stopping the behavior, preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects on the victim, regardless of notice. Sexual harassment within an employee's job responsibilities can vary, with quid pro quo harassment clearly falling within this scope. Hostile environment harassment is evaluated based on various factors, and even behavior outside an employee's job responsibilities can create a hostile environment if serious enough. In cases of student-on-student harassment creating a hostile environment, schools must take prompt and effective action to stop the behavior and prevent its recurrence. The school is responsible for ending the harassment, preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects on the student. Notice of a sexually hostile environment is established if a responsible school employee knew or should have known about the harassment. A responsible employee is defined as someone with the authority to address harassment and report it to school officials. Schools must take immediate and effective action to address and prevent sexual harassment, even if not formally reported. Failure to do so violates Title IX. The school must promptly investigate harassment by a student, parent, or observed by an employee, regardless of formal complaint. If allegations are confirmed, the school must respond appropriately. Informal mechanisms may be used with agreement, but not for cases like sexual assault. Schools must ensure due process rights do not delay Title IX protections for the complainant. In 2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter supplementing its 2001 Guidance on Title IX obligations for schools regarding peer-to-peer harassment. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual conduct, advances, requests, and violence, creating a hostile environment that schools must address promptly to eliminate and prevent recurrence. The Letter emphasized that schools must respond to incidents of sexual harassment off school grounds and process complaints promptly. Schools should consider off-campus conduct when evaluating a hostile environment. Criminal investigations do not relieve schools of their duty to conduct a Title IX investigation, and schools should take immediate steps to protect students. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the importance of schools promptly resuming and completing Title IX investigations after a criminal fact-finding by police. It highlighted the need for schools to use a preponderance of the evidence standard in their grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints, contrasting it with the prior \"clear and convincing\" standard. The 2014 Q&A document provided further guidance on schools' responsibilities regarding student-on-student sexual violence under Title IX, emphasizing the need for immediate and appropriate investigation when possible sexual violence is known or suspected. It clarified that schools must treat both parties equally in appeal processes and reiterated that the guidance is not legally enforceable as a legislative rule. The 2014 Q&A document clarified that Title IX requires schools to promptly address sexual violence allegations, protect complainants, and conduct thorough investigations. It outlined the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator, the requirements for written grievance procedures, and the need for interim measures to ensure safety before investigations are complete. The 2014 Q&A emphasized the importance of schools promptly addressing sexual violence allegations, conducting thorough investigations, and protecting complainants. It clarified that schools must conduct their own Title IX investigations even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. The document also discouraged schools from allowing parties to personally cross-examine one another during hearings on allegations of sexual violence. OCR \"strongly discourage[d]\" schools from allowing parties to personally cross-examine one another during hearings on allegations of sexual violence, as it may be traumatic or intimidating. Instead, schools could have parties submit questions to a trained third party to ask on their behalf, who would screen and ask only appropriate and relevant questions. Schools developed various procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX in response to guidance from ED and increased OCR oversight between 2011 and 2016. The specific procedures for investigating sexual harassment allegations vary among educational institutions, with Title IX providing some discretion to ED for enforcement but constrained by due process protections for state actors. In the public university context, students challenged disciplinary procedures as unconstitutional, particularly in Title IX cases involving sexual misconduct. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to provide procedural protections when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. Property interests protected by the Clause arise from sources like state or federal law, not the Constitution itself. To have a protected property interest in a government-created benefit, one must show a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" originating from state law. Due process is required when a state deprives an individual of liberty, especially when their reputation is at stake. Courts consider factors like the private interest affected, risk of erroneous deprivation, and government interest when determining the procedures due before depriving individuals of a protected interest. The Court emphasizes that individuals with a protected interest must be given notice and a chance to be heard before being deprived of that interest. Due process is flexible and requires procedural protections based on the severity of the deprivation. The stronger the private interest at risk, the more formal procedures are needed. Goss v. Lopez is the only Supreme Court case addressing procedural due process in student discipline, where high school students challenged their suspension without a hearing. The Supreme Court ruled that students facing suspension must be given notice and a hearing, with more formal procedures required for longer suspensions or expulsions. Public universities must comply with constitutional standards, while private universities do not. Federal courts have recognized that students in public universities have a protectable property right in their education. Federal courts have held that public schools must provide students with notice of charges, evidence, and a fair hearing. Colleges have varied procedures to address sexual harassment allegations, leading to legal challenges. Recent court rulings have addressed due process violations in Title IX investigations. Recent court rulings have addressed due process violations in Title IX investigations regarding claims of sexual misconduct at public universities. Challenges include inadequate notice of charges, lack of opportunity to confront witnesses, biased decision-makers, and unfair review processes. Courts have emphasized the importance of timely and detailed notice of charges to avoid due process violations. The absence of protocols for accused students can lead to viable due process claims, as seen in cases where students were not properly notified of allegations against them. In one instance, a student was suspended without adequate notice, leading to a due process violation. In another case, a student was expelled for misconduct not clearly outlined in the initial notice of charges. These examples highlight the importance of providing detailed and timely notice to avoid due process violations in Title IX investigations. The court found that the school violated the student's liberty interest by not providing due process in a disciplinary decision related to suspected sexual assault. The investigator failed to give the evidence used against the student, leading to a due process violation. Students have brought claims for denial of due process due to lack of cross-examination opportunities. Courts have often rejected due process challenges in school disciplinary hearings, especially regarding cross-examination rights. The Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in these proceedings, even in cases of sexual harassment allegations. In cases of sexual harassment allegations, courts have rejected due process challenges in school disciplinary hearings, where students were not allowed to directly cross-examine their accusers. Students could submit written questions to the panel but not follow-up questions, with the panel failing to ask all submitted questions. The courts reasoned that the limited cross-examination satisfied credibility requirements, outweighing the burden on the school. In cases of disciplinary proceedings, courts have ruled in favor of due process challenges when credibility determinations were critical to the outcome. For example, a university violated due process by not allowing any form of cross-examination in a hearing where the decision relied on a credibility determination based solely on hearsay. The court emphasized the importance of providing some method for the adjudicative body to assess demeanor in such cases. In cases where credibility determinations are crucial, courts have ruled in favor of due process challenges. For instance, a university was found to violate due process by not allowing cross-examination in a hearing where credibility was key. The court stressed the need for a method to assess demeanor in such situations. The Sixth Circuit ruled that in cases where credibility is crucial, universities must allow the accused student to cross-examine accusers and witnesses before a neutral fact-finder to ensure due process. Some students have also claimed they were denied the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence in their defense, with courts examining such claims on a case-by-case basis. In a lawsuit against a university, a student alleged being denied the chance to present evidence in a sexual assault disciplinary hearing, raising due process concerns. Students in similar proceedings have challenged decisionmaker bias, with courts requiring evidence to overcome the presumption of impartiality. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a bias claim in a sexual assault case due to lack of evidence undermining the proceedings' integrity. The integrity of disciplinary proceedings was undermined when a university investigator also served as a victim advocate and advised the panel. The court found no evidence to suggest a different investigator would have changed the outcome. However, bias in decisionmakers' behavior or statements can lead to a due process challenge, as seen in a case where a student alleged bias in a sexual assault disciplinary hearing. The Sixth Circuit held that a panel member acting as investigator, prosecutor, and judge could constitute a due process violation. The student alleged bias in a sexual assault disciplinary hearing, claiming a panel member made remarks to reduce credibility and pre-judged the case. Courts have addressed claims of bias based on institutional pressures, such as unbalanced sexual assault training for university officials. Plaintiffs' belief that the school railroaded accused students to appease the Department of Education was unsupported by evidence. In contrast, a district court rejected a motion to dismiss a due process claim brought by an expelled student alleging biased training materials for the panel deciding his case. The court found a potential due process violation as the panel may have been trained to ignore deficiencies in the investigation, potentially tipping the scales against the accused student. Other cases have addressed due process violations in university disciplinary proceedings, including unfair review processes for rehearing appeals. The district court found a new hearing unfair to a student, ruling that the allegations survived the university's motion to dismiss. In another case, a suspended student challenged the validity of a school's procedures, where he was found guilty without sufficient notice or time to respond to new evidence. The appeals board reversed the initial determination without explanation or live testimony, leading to a due process violation. The federal district court found that a university violated due process by expelling a student without a fair hearing. The student was not given a chance to defend himself before being expelled for sexual assault, despite being found not responsible initially. The court ruled that the lack of notice of allegations and pre-judgment of the case constituted a due process violation. In response, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 guidelines. In September 2017, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers document, stating it would begin the rulemaking process to codify schools' responsibilities under Title IX. In the interim, ED continued to rely on the 2001 Guidance and issued a new Question and Answer document on addressing sexual misconduct. The document allows schools to resolve complaints through mediation and choose to allow appeals by the party found guilty of misconduct. On November 29, 2018, ED proposed new regulations that would redefine sexual harassment under Title IX, require \"actual notice\" of harassment, and alter schools' responsibilities in responding to allegations. The proposed regulations under Title IX would define sexual harassment in various ways, including quid pro quo, hostile environment, and sexual assault. It would establish a higher threshold for proving a Title IX violation based on hostile environment harassment compared to past definitions issued by the Department of Education. The regulations also aim to ensure due process for both the accuser and the accused during investigations of sexual harassment allegations. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for proving hostile environment harassment, defining it as conduct that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, effectively denying equal access to education programs. This differs from past definitions by the Department of Education, which focused on conduct that limits a student's ability to benefit from or participate in school programs. Additionally, the regulations depart from past practice by no longer considering \"constructive notice\" as triggering a violation. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for proving hostile environment harassment, defining it as conduct that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, effectively denying equal access to education programs. The proposal would require schools to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when they have \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice of harassment to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to institute corrective measures. This aligns with the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis. The regulations reject imputing knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The proposed regulations under Title IX would compel schools to respond only to sexual harassment within their \"education program or activity,\" departing from past guidance that required responses to harassment regardless of where it occurred. The new regulations only require a response that is not \"deliberately indifferent,\" aligning with the standard set by the Court in Davis. This standard aims to hold schools accountable while allowing flexibility in disciplinary decisions. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline three situations where schools are provided a safe harbor from a finding of deliberate indifference: when a formal complaint is made, when there is actual knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, and when supportive measures are offered to the complainant in higher education institutions. Compliance with grievance procedures would negate any inference of deliberate indifference in these situations. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline safe harbor situations for schools to avoid being found deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment. Schools must respond to sexual harassment cases with actual knowledge in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent. The regulations also allow for emergency removal of individuals accused of sexual harassment, with a requirement for a risk and safety analysis. Due process protections for accused students are emphasized in the proposal. Schools must investigate allegations in a formal complaint of sexual harassment under Title IX, providing written notice to relevant parties with details of the allegations. Grievance procedures must treat complainants and respondents equitably, offering remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents. Discrimination based on sex in the treatment of either party can violate Title IX. The proposed regulations for investigating alleged harassment under Title IX require schools to conduct objective evaluations of evidence, ensure unbiased individuals are involved in the process, presume respondents are not guilty until proven otherwise, and outline possible sanctions and remedies. Schools must place the burden of proof on themselves, allow equal opportunity for both parties to present evidence, and permit both parties to have an advisor present during proceedings. The proposed regulations for investigating alleged harassment under Title IX require schools to conduct objective evaluations of evidence, ensure unbiased individuals are involved in the process, presume respondents are not guilty until proven otherwise, and outline possible sanctions and remedies. Schools must provide parties with written notice of hearing details, allow advisors to participate, conduct live hearings with cross-examination, and provide a report summarizing evidence at least 10 days prior to a hearing. The proposed regulations for investigating alleged harassment under Title IX require a quasi-judicial live hearing for higher education institutions. Cross-examination by parties' advisors is allowed, and decision-making must be separate from the investigator or Title IX Coordinator. Schools can choose between preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standards, with consistent application for all complaints. Appeals are optional but must be available to both parties if offered. The Title IX regulations require a live hearing for investigating harassment claims in higher education, allowing cross-examination by advisors and separate decision-making. Schools can choose the standard of evidence and must offer optional appeals to both parties. The antidiscrimination mandate of Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination but does not specifically address sexual abuse or harassment, leaving federal courts to determine remedies for individual victims. Congress has the discretion to modify Title IX to clarify standards for private suits and administrative enforcement. This could include defining specific conduct violations, handling harassment differently in various educational settings, and modifying legal standards for private suits. Additionally, Congress could address distinctions between harassment by teachers and students. Congress could direct federal agencies to alter their administrative enforcement of Title IX, such as by promulgating regulations that distinguish between types of sexual harassment or treat harassment differently depending on the context."
