    "content": "The \"Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001\" includes a grant program for rail line relocation. The \"Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001\" establishes a grant program for local rail line relocation projects to mitigate adverse effects of rail traffic on safety, traffic flow, and economic development in municipalities. Eligible projects involve relocating rail lines to avoid grade crossing closures or road construction, meeting cost-benefit requirements for grants. The grant program for rail line relocation projects requires that benefits exceed costs for the estimated economic life of the relocated rail line. Factors considered include impacts on traffic, safety, area commerce, and rail operations. Additionally, the Secretary evaluates the state's funding capability when approving grant applications. The State must fund rail line relocation projects without Federal grant funding, with specific allocation requirements and limitations. At least 50% of grant funds must go to projects under $20,000,000, and no more than 25% can be allocated to any one project. The Federal share of the grant is 90% of project costs, with the State required to pay the remaining 10%. The State must contribute 10% of shared project costs funded by a grant, which can be paid in cash or in-kind contributions. In-kind contributions include real or personal property, employee services based on costs incurred, and project costs prior to grant application. The State must contribute 10% of shared project costs funded by a grant, which can be paid in cash or in-kind contributions.

Costs not shared for a project in a municipality do not include any cost defrayed with funds or in-kind contributions from a source other than the municipality without certain conditions. The Secretary determines shared costs for projects, with final decisions. States can combine grant amounts for projects if mutually beneficial and legal. Regulations will be set by the Secretary for implementation. The Secretary will set regulations for implementing this section. The term 'State' includes political subdivisions.
