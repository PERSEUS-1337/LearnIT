    "content": "The Act titled \"Made in America Manufacturing Communities Act of 2016\" establishes a program to designate and support manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating consortiums as manufacturing communities and supporting them with financial and technical assistance. The program supports consortiums with financial and technical assistance from participating agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development. The program supports consortiums with financial and technical assistance from various participating agencies, including the Department of Labor, Transportation, Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration. Each participating agency must identify applicable programs for the established program, and multiple members of the same consortium can seek the same assistance. The program supports consortiums with financial and technical assistance from various participating agencies. If multiple members of the same consortium apply for the same assistance, the head of the agency can determine preference and may require coordination among the members. The program provides financial and technical assistance to consortiums designated as manufacturing communities. Participating agencies may award assistance to consortium members and require coordination among them. A report must be submitted to the Secretary detailing preferential consideration for assistance. The program offers financial and technical assistance to manufacturing communities through consortiums. Recipients can use the funds to invest in infrastructure, access to capital, exports promotion, and equipment upgrades to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. The program offers financial and technical assistance to manufacturing communities through consortiums for infrastructure, capital access, exports promotion, and equipment upgrades. Coordination by the Secretary of Commerce and inter-agency coordination are required to identify programs and avoid duplication of efforts. Manufacturing communities can be designated for support. The program provides financial and technical assistance to manufacturing communities through consortiums. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums through a competitive process, which must include institutions of higher education, private sector entities, and government entities. The program offers assistance to manufacturing communities through consortiums designated by the Secretary in a competitive process involving various entities like government, economic development groups, financial institutions, and utilities. Lead applicants can be district organizations, Indian tribes, State entities, or political subdivisions engaged in economic activities. The program provides assistance to manufacturing communities through consortiums designated by the Secretary, involving various entities like government, economic development groups, and higher education institutions. Consortiums can define their represented region, which must contain critical elements of key technologies or supply chain prioritized by the consortium. Each designation by the Secretary for consortiums is for a 2-year period and can be renewed upon application. The consortium must submit an application for renewal with any necessary modifications. The Secretary evaluates eligible consortiums for renewal based on performance and project-specific metrics proposed in the consortium's designation. The eligible consortium seeking designation must submit an application to the Secretary, including proposed metrics for tracking progress and criteria for improving U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Other relevant criteria may also be considered by the Secretary. Each application submitted to the Secretary by an eligible consortium must include a description of the regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and an assessment of the local industrial ecosystem. An eligible consortium must submit an evidence-based plan for developing workforce, supplier network, research, innovation, infrastructure, trade, investment, operational improvements, and capital access components for manufacturing activities in the region. The plan should include specific investments to address gaps in the ecosystem and make the region uniquely competitive. Additionally, the consortium must describe the proposed investments and implementation strategy to address ecosystem gaps, focusing on outcome-based results. The consortium must track outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones to evaluate their manufacturing strategy in the region. The Secretary will evaluate applications based on regional cooperation levels and national manufacturing competitiveness. The Secretary may accept transferred funds from other agencies to carry out this section."
