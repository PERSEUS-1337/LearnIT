It involves the conveyance of certain facilities at the McGee Creek Project in Oklahoma to the McGee Creek Authority. The Secretary has the authority to convey various facilities at the McGee Creek Project to the Authority, excluding the mineral estate.

All parties must comply with the Agreement terms, and the Secretary must complete required actions under environmental and species protection laws before any conveyance. On conveyance of land and facilities, the Authority must comply with applicable laws, including the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and other laws. The Authority is responsible for all costs related to operation, maintenance, and enhancement of the transferred facilities, without eligibility for federal funding. Upon conveyance of land and facilities, the United States is released from liability for damages, except for negligence committed before the conveyance. The Authority is responsible for all costs and cannot receive federal funding, except for what is available to comparable entities not subject to reclamation laws. The contract for the McGee Creek Project remains in effect, with the possibility of amendments. Reclamation laws still apply to project water provided to the Authority."
