    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2017\". The generic programs known as \"checkoff programs\" are intended to increase demand for agricultural commodities and benefit all producers. However, there have been instances of funds being used to influence policy, leading to conflicts of interest and harming some producers. Strict separation between the boards managing the funds and policy entities is necessary to prevent misuse of funds. Prohibiting conflicts of interest and anticompetitive conduct in checkoff programs is essential to ensure their proper operation and prevent abuses. Transparency in fund expenditure is necessary to uncover and prevent such abuses. The text chunk discusses the importance of defining key terms in order to prevent conflicts of interest and anticompetitive behavior in checkoff programs. The Act defines key terms related to checkoff programs, such as the Board and Checkoff program, which promote agricultural commodities without specific producer or brand references. The Act includes various programs like the Cotton Research and Promotion Act, Potato Research and Promotion Act, Egg Research and Consumer Information Act, Beef Research and Information Act, Wheat and Wheat Foods Research and Nutrition Education Act, and Floral Research and Consumer Information Act. The curr_chunk lists various agricultural acts including the Dairy Production Stabilization Act, Honey Research Act, Pork Promotion Act, Watermelon Research Act, Pecan Promotion Act, Mushroom Promotion Act, Lime Research Act, Soybean Promotion Act, Fluid Milk Promotion Act, and Fresh Cut Flowers Act. The curr_chunk lists additional agricultural acts such as the Sheep Promotion Act, Canola and Rapeseed Act, Kiwifruit Act, Popcorn Act, and Hass Avocado Act.

Conflict of interest is defined as a financial interest in a person or entity that provides a service to a Board. Secretary refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS OF CHECKOFF PROGRAMS.

Contracts must include accurate records of funds received and be made public immediately upon approval by the Secretary. The Board must disclose the amount, purpose, recipient, and other parties involved in disbursements. The Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture must conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with this section by checkoff programs. The Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture conducts audits on checkoff programs, prepares reports, and submits them to Congress and the Comptroller General of the United States every 3 to 5 years. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct an audit to assess compliance and integrity of checkoff programs, and prepare a report with recommendations for strengthening actions and improving legislation. The Comptroller General of the United States will consider inspector general reports in preparing recommendations for strengthening checkoff programs and legislation. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.
