    "content": "The RAH-66 Comanche is a next-generation armed reconnaissance helicopter designed to stealthily penetrate enemy airspace and conduct reconnaissance. It is equipped with advanced computers and communications to play a leading role in the digital battlespace. Originally intended to replace older Army helicopters, budget constraints led to modifications in the program, reducing the procurement objective to 1,292 armed reconnaissance helicopters. The RAH-66 Comanche program underwent budget cuts and restructuring, reducing the number of prototypes and production helicopters. The program successfully completed tests in 2000 and entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase. Boeing-Sikorsky built and flew two prototypes, with plans for additional pre-production and production aircraft. The objective was to deliver 1,213 Comanches by 2024, but budget constraints led to changes in the program. The RAH-66 Comanche program underwent budget cuts and restructuring, reducing the number of prototypes and production helicopters. Former DoD acquisition chief Pete Aldridge signed an acquisition decision memorandum to reduce the total purchase of Comanches from 1,213 to 650 aircraft. The production phase cost was reduced from $39.3 billion to an estimated $26.9 billion, with the Army aiming to produce 60 aircraft per year starting in 2011. The Comanche development program faced cost increases and restructuring due to concurrent development of multiple systems. The latest restructuring delays certain capabilities to later blocks and focuses on developing a companion UAV. Approximately $644 million will be spent on the UAV instead of the platform itself. The Army has been experimenting with teaming UAVs with Apache and Comanche helicopters. The Comanche program faced cost increases and restructuring, with plans for a companion UAV. The final number of Comanche helicopters is uncertain, with Army officials stating they need 819 for their Objective Force by 2008. The restructuring was seen as a positive step, but continued emphasis is needed to prevent integration problems in the future. Critics of the RAH-66 Comanche argue that its capabilities were developed for a Cold War threat environment that no longer exists. They suggest cancelling the program and upgrading existing helicopters instead. Proponents defend the Comanche's reduced radar signature but critics point out that current threats in Iraq do not rely on radar targeting. Proponents of the RAH-66 Comanche argue that it meets the demands of today's low-intensity conflicts, making U.S. Forces more deployable and versatile. They claim that the Comanche improves situational awareness, survivability, and lethality compared to other helicopters like the Kiowa Warrior. The Comanche also enhances the effectiveness of the Longbow in attack units. The Comanche's maintenance costs and effectiveness compared to other helicopters like the Kiowa Warrior and AH-64D are debated. The Army is considering options such as improving the Apache or procuring more Longbow models due to the reduction in the Comanche program. The role of the Comanche versus the Apache remains a point of contention. The Army is debating whether to upgrade the Comanche for heavy attack requirements or pursue features like external fuel and air-to-air missile capability. Questions remain about the Comanche's ability to maintain stealth while carrying external weapons and its weight and fuel capacity. The Marine Corps may seek a replacement for its AH-1Z Super Cobra helicopters around 2020, potentially through a joint program with the Army. Congress has consistently supported the Comanche program by meeting or exceeding DoD's budget requests. The House Armed Services Committee criticized the Army and DoD for lack of commitment to the Comanche program, urging higher funding priority and full-scale production by 2004. Congress matched the Administration's FY04 Comanche funding request. Questions arise about the long-term capabilities if the Comanche buy is reduced and its contribution to combat power compared to light armored vehicles. $6.8 billion has been spent on the Comanche program. The Army has spent $6.8 billion on the Comanche program. There are questions about the effectiveness of purchasing 650 helicopters and whether fixed-wing aircraft might be more suitable for Close Air Support. Some argue that the Comanche could replace the Apache as the Army's premier attack helicopter. Export issues and sustaining the aviation industrial base are also considerations. The potential export of the Comanche helicopter is being considered to sustain the aviation industrial base and balance U.S. trade. Questions arise about offering it to more countries due to its less aggressive design compared to the Apache, but limitations may be necessary due to its stealth features.
