    "content": "There are modifications and an increased volume cap for qualified mortgage bonds. The curr_chunk discusses special rules for subprime refinancings related to qualified mortgage bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes modifications for residences originally financed through qualified subprime loans, such as changes to the mortgage requirements and purchase price requirements. The curr_chunk explains that for qualified subprime loans, the market value of the residence at the time of refinancing is used instead of the acquisition cost. Qualified subprime loans are adjustable rate single-family residential mortgage loans originated between December 31, 2001, and January 1, 2008, with characteristics indicating a foreseeable risk of default but potential to avoid default with lower cost refinancing. Characteristics considered include scheduled loan payment increases exceeding 10%. The curr_chunk discusses subprime loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 97% or higher, low creditworthiness, and a credit score below 660. The curr_chunk discusses an increase in the volume cap for qualified mortgage bonds in 2008, with a $15 billion increase in the State ceiling. The State ceiling increase for qualified mortgage bonds in 2008 is allocated solely for qualified mortgage issues meeting specific requirements. Unused limitations cannot be used for purposes other than issuing qualified mortgage bonds and cannot be issued after 2010. The amendment excludes certain types of bonds from the Alternative Minimum Tax, including qualified 501(c)(3) bonds and qualified mortgage bonds issued between December 31, 2007, and January 1, 2011. The effective date for these changes is after December 31, 2007."
