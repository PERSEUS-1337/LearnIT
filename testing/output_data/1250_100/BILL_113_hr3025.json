The Act \"Irene and Lee Tax Relief Storm Recovery Act of 2013\" increases the State housing credit ceiling for states affected by Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee in 2011 for calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The applicable limitation is the lesser of $2.15 multiplied by the population of the area or 50 percent of the State housing credit ceiling for 2013. Unused State housing credit ceiling is determined for any calendar year. The Irene-Lee disaster area is designated as a difficult development area for properties placed in service during 2013, 2014, or 2015. This designation exempts it from certain limitations on State housing credit ceiling increases. Clause (i) applies to housing credit dollar amounts allocated during 2013, 2014, or 2015, and only to bonds issued after December 31, 2012. A special rule applies for income tests for properties placed in service after 2012 and before 2020 in a nonmetropolitan area within the Irene-Lee disaster area. The low-income housing credit allocations for buildings in the Irene-Lee disaster area made in 2013-2015 and placed in service before January 1, 2019, are exempt from certain rules. The Irene-Lee disaster area includes counties under a qualifying natural disaster declaration. The qualifying natural disaster declaration in 2011 includes a natural disaster declared by the Secretary of Agriculture due to damaging weather conditions related to Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee, or a major disaster designated by the President due to damaging weather conditions related to Hurricane. The amendment under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act related to Hurricane Irene or Tropical Storm Lee will take effect upon enactment of the Act."
