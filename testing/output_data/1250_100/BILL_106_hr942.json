    "content": "The \"Broadcast Ownership for the 21st Century Act\" is cited as the short title. It includes a revision of duopoly rules in the Communications Act of 1934. The Commission is limited in prohibiting ownership of two stations with overlapping coverage contours in separate television markets or two television stations in the same market, with one being a UHF station. Existing local marketing agreements between two broadcast television stations in the same market are exempt from the duopoly rule. In exceptional cases, ownership of two VHF stations may be permitted by the Commission. The Commission may allow ownership of two VHF television stations in the same market if it does not harm competition or media diversity. SEC. 3. CROSS-OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS. The Federal Communications Commission is required to make rule changes regarding ownership limitations for broadcast station licenses and the one-to-a-market rule. Minority voting stock interests will not be considered a cognizable interest in certain cases. Cable cross-ownership limitations under the Communications Act of 1934 are also amended. The Federal Communications Commission is revising regulations to allow ownership interests in both broadcasting stations and cable systems serving the same community.
