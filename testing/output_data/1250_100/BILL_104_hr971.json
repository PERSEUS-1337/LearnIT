The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US to preserve and enhance their property value. The value of a home is closely tied to the quality of the neighborhood and environment, including water, air, flooding risk, scenic beauty, noise levels, wildlife, and other factors. The value of homeowners' property can be affected by land development, industrial activity, and other actions from neighboring properties. Protecting homeowners from irresponsible actions is crucial for communities and society. Current public information procedures may not adequately inform homeowners about activities that could impact their property values. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that could reduce the value of their homes. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies to require notice from individuals conducting property impacting activities. This includes applications for permits, licenses, contracts, or arrangements that may generate pollutants or reduce the value of private homes.

The notice must describe the proposed activity's potential impacts on private homes and the public.
