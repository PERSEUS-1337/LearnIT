It uses gumbel softmax or online k-means clustering for quantization, enabling the application of NLP algorithms that require discrete inputs. Experiments show BERT pre-training achieves state-of-the-art results on TIMIT phoneme classification and WSJ speech recognition. This approach combines learning discrete speech representations with context prediction, offering a new direction in speech processing research. The vq-wav2vec encoder maps raw audio to a dense representation, which is quantized and aggregated into context representations for training acoustic models. A new discretization algorithm, vq-wav2vec, learns discrete representations of audio segments using Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering. BERT representations outperform log-mel filterbank inputs in experiments. BERT representations outperform log-mel filterbank inputs and dense wav2vec representations on TIMIT and WSJ benchmarks. Discretization of audio allows for the application of NLP algorithms to speech data, such as using a sequence to sequence model for speech recognition over discrete audio tokens. WAV2VEC learns audio representations through a self-supervised context-prediction task with convolutional neural networks. Our approach, vq-wav2vec, utilizes vector quantized representations of audio data through a future time-step prediction task. It follows the architectural choices of wav2vec and optimizes loss by summing over different step sizes. BERT is a pre-training approach for NLP tasks that uses a transformer encoder model to build text representations, combining masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks during training. The vq-wav2vec approach utilizes vector quantized representations of audio data for future time-step prediction. It involves convolutional networks for feature extraction, a quantization module for discrete representations, and an aggregator for context prediction tasks. The quantization module replaces the original dense representations with discrete indices from a fixed size codebook. Multiple vector quantizations are performed to prevent mode collapse. The Gumbel-Softmax method is used for selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable way. During training, probabilities for variable selection are determined using uniform samples. The vector quantization approach is used for index selection, optimizing future time step prediction loss. The closest variable to input features is chosen based on Euclidean distance. During training, the Gumbel-Softmax method is utilized for selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable manner. The vector quantization approach optimizes future time step prediction loss by choosing the closest variable to input features based on Euclidean distance. The final loss includes terms for future prediction task, moving codebook vectors closer to encoder output, and ensuring encoder outputs are close to a centroid. To address mode collapse, a strategy of independently quantizing partitions of the encoder feature vector z is proposed, similar to product quantization. The text discusses the quantization of feature vectors into groups for improved downstream performance. It explains the organization of the feature vector into multiple groups and the use of VQ approaches for each group. The codebook variables can be shared or not shared across groups, with shared variables generally yielding competitive results. Training a vq-wav2vec model allows for discretizing audio data for algorithms requiring discrete inputs. By discretizing audio data, we can apply it to algorithms needing discrete inputs. Using BERT pre-training, we predict masked input tokens based on context encoding. To improve speech recognition, we feed BERT representations into an acoustic model. To make masked token prediction harder, we mask spans of consecutive discretized speech tokens. This method improves accuracy over masking individual tokens. In this study, the authors trained vq-wav2vec on 960h of Librispeech data, resulting in 345m tokens. Ablations were performed on a clean 100h subset with 36M tokens.
