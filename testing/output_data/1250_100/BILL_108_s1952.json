    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that under the Trade Act of 1974, the US Trade Representative must enforce rights if they are being denied. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act states that determinations of violations will be based on World Trade Organization findings. A panel report confirmed that section 301 of the Trade Act is consistent with US obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements. On January 28, 2000, a WTO panel found Mexico's antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the US violated trade agreements. Despite a deadline for compliance, Mexico issued a revised antidumping determination on September 20, 2000, to evade its commitment. On January 1, 2002, Mexico imposed a 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, in defiance of WTO rulings, to maintain its antidumping order on US high fructose corn syrup. Mexico lifted its antidumping order on United States high fructose corn syrup after imposing a tax on soft drinks containing the syrup, ensuring that US imports would not enter the Mexican market. This move was part of Mexico's effort to deny US trade rights regarding high fructose corn syrup. The import restrictions of Mexico's antidumping order led to a 20 percent tax on high fructose corn syrup from the United States, causing a significant drop in imports. The United States has pursued dispute settlement actions against Mexico due to adverse findings. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms related to dispute settlement, including the Appellate Body, Dispute Settlement Body, dispute settlement panel, Dispute Settlement Understanding, GATT 1994, and Uruguay Round Agreements. The term \"Agreements\" is defined in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The World Trade Organization refers to the organization established under the WTO Agreement, and the WTO Agreement was entered into on April 15, 1994. SEC. 4. Enforcement of U.S. rights under trade agreements for high fructose corn syrup exports to Mexico. Congress determines that Mexico's imposition of a 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup and the extension of an unjustified antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the United States constitutes unjustifiable acts that restrict U.S. commerce and deny U.S. rights under existing trade agreements with Mexico. The United States Trade Representative will take action if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup and protect U.S. rights under trade agreements. If certification is not provided, action will be taken within 60 days after the enactment of the Act. The United States Trade Representative may suspend trade agreement concessions with Mexico or impose duties on Mexican goods, including agricultural products, if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup and protect U.S. rights under trade agreements."
