    "content": "The \"Monetary Policy and Treasury Finance Enhancement Act of 1993\" aims to help the Federal Reserve System and investors predict inflation, reduce inflation, and lower interest rates through the issuance of indexed obligations. The \"Monetary Policy and Treasury Finance Enhancement Act of 1993\" introduces a new section on Indexed Obligations, requiring at least 10 percent of longer-term public debt obligations to be in indexed form. If less than 10 percent of outstanding obligations are indexed, a higher requirement is imposed. The \"Monetary Policy and Treasury Finance Enhancement Act of 1993\" mandates that a portion of longer-term public debt obligations must be in indexed form, with specific requirements for maturity periods. The Secretary of the Treasury has the discretion to issue indexed obligations with varying maturity dates under sections 3102 and 3103. The Secretary of the Treasury can issue indexed obligations under specific conditions, with a requirement that at least 5 percent of new obligations issued annually must be in indexed form. Indexed obligations have a redemption value equal to their indexed face amount, with specific face amount and maturity restrictions. Indexed face amount is the sum of the obligation's face amount at issuance and the face amount multiplied by the percentage difference between the selected index for the date and the selected index for the issue date. The selected index for any date is determined based on the second calendar month preceding that date. The term 'selected index' typically refers to the CPI, unless specified otherwise. The term 'selected index' refers to the CPI unless another index is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and approved by Congress. The selected index for an indexed obligation is determined at the date of issue and remains unchanged despite any subsequent changes in its structure or computation. The term 'CPI' refers to the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. Indexed obligations can be sold competitively or otherwise as per Treasury regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury consults with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on amounts, maturities, and timing of issuances. Benefits are considered in determining the amounts and timing of indexed obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury must attribute benefits to improvements in monetary management resulting from indexed obligations issuance, assure liquidity and pricing reliability, and periodically announce expected issuance and maturity dates of indexed obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury will monitor ownership and trading activity of indexed and nonindexed obligations with the same maturity dates to ensure liquidity and pricing reliability. Reports on the program established under this section must be submitted to Congress every 2 years. Amendments to section 3121 include specifying whether an obligation is to be issued as an indexed obligation. Amendments to section 3121 include specifying whether an obligation is to be issued as an indexed obligation. The amendments made by this section regarding indexed obligations will apply to fiscal years starting after the enactment of the Act. Congress intends for Federal income tax changes affecting nonindexed obligations to also apply to indexed obligations, with symmetrical treatment for increases and decreases in the indexed face amount."
