    "content": "The Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Gun Show Background Check\" act. The Congress finds that approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held annually in the US, attracting thousands of attendees and providing a venue for criminals to obtain firearms without background checks. The term 'gun show' is defined as an event with 50 or more firearms offered for sale, excluding individual sales. The term 'gun show vendor' refers to a person who is not licensed under section 923 and who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, or exchanges a firearm at a gun show. This excludes sales, exchanges, or transfers by individuals from their personal collection at their private residence if they are not required to be licensed under section 923. Gun shows with less than 100 firearms offered for sale, conducted by private, not-for-profit organizations for hunting activities, and attended only by members and their immediate families are also exempt. Regulation of firearms transfers at gun shows includes requirements for gun show operators such as age, eligibility to transport firearms, and compliance with firearm laws. Gun show vendors are individuals who sell, transfer, or exchange firearms at gun shows, excluding private sales at personal residences and small not-for-profit events. Gun show operators must register with the Attorney General, provide fingerprints and a photograph, certify compliance with requirements, disclose all material information truthfully, and pay a registration fee. Operating a gun show without meeting these requirements is unlawful. Gun show operators must notify the Attorney General before the event, verify vendors' identities with valid ID documents and require them to sign a ledger and notice. Gun show vendors must be informed of their obligations and attendees must be notified of the requirements of the chapter. Records must be maintained to demonstrate compliance. Background checks are required before transferring firearms between unlicensed persons at a gun show. Gun show vendors must maintain records of firearm transactions, including make, model, and serial number. They must also notify both the seller and buyer about the background check system to ensure compliance with the law. Gun show vendors are required to submit a report to the Attorney General within 10 days of a firearm transfer, detailing the make, model, and serial number of the firearm. They must also keep a record of the transfer as part of their business records. The Attorney General cannot impose recordkeeping requirements on gun show vendors under this section. Penalties for non-compliance are outlined in Section 924(a) of the title. Whoever violates subsections of section 932 may face fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both. For violations of other subsections, penalties include fines, imprisonment up to 2 years, or both, with harsher penalties for repeat offenses. The Attorney General can suspend or revoke registration and impose fines up to $10,000 for violations. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of contents for chapter 44 of the title. The Attorney General is granted authority to inspect gun show operators' records without a warrant for compliance purposes. Additionally, reporting requirements for multiple sales at gun shows are expanded. Increased penalties for serious recordkeeping violations by licensees include fines, imprisonment up to 10 years for certain offenses. Increased penalties for violations of criminal background check requirements, including amending penalties under Section 924(a)(5) and eliminating certain elements of offense under Section 922(t)(5). The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives may hire additional personnel for inspecting gun shows, with a requirement to submit biennial reports to Congress on firearm sales at these shows. Section (j) states that this section and its amendments will take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act. It focuses on ensuring firearms are not sold without background checks conducted by the national instant criminal background check system. It also addresses the resources needed to implement this section and any recommendations for improvements."
