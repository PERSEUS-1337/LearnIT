    "content": "The U.S. Strategic Command considers information operations a core military competency, focusing on electromagnetic energy, cyber operations, and psychological operations. The Department of Defense now views cyberspace as a domain for warfare, with a recent memo defining it as a global domain within the information environment. This aligns with the 2008 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations, which guides all services. Cyberspace operations are defined as the use of cyber capabilities to achieve military objectives. Cyberspace operations are a component of Information Operations (IO) and include computer network operations and activities to operate and defend the Global Information Grid. Each service has organizations with IO and Electronic Warfare (EW) responsibilities, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, Army Reserve Information Operations Command, U.S. Army IO Proponent, Army Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directorate, and the Air Force's 24th Air Force. This Air Force unit is responsible for cyberwarfare, electronic warfare, and protection of critical infrastructure networks. The DOD considers information a weapon and a target in warfare, using Psychological Operations to influence decision-making and deter aggression. However, RAND Corporation's 2006 report highlights how Information Operations can impact unintended audiences, emphasizing the need for noncombatant considerations in planning and execution. The effects of Information Operations extend beyond intended targets, influencing all parties involved and being interpreted differently by various groups and media worldwide. New technologies play a crucial role in shaping the impact of Information Operations in today's conflict environment. New technologies for military IO create new national security policy issues, including psychological operations and accusations of war crimes. Insurgents use electronic devices to detonate bombs and influence public opinion through video broadcasts. DOD is seeking methods to counter these actions where violence may be seen as secondary to the manipulation of information. The report discusses current adversary threats in the information environment, DOD capabilities for military information operations, federal cybersecurity efforts, and policy issues. Adversaries use the electromagnetic spectrum for kinetic attacks, disrupting access, influencing targets, and stealing data. Examples of threats include challenges to US military dominance in the spectrum, terrorist groups using wireless electronics for attacks, and peer competitors focusing on electronic warfare. Adversaries are focusing on electronic warfare to deny US forces access to the spectrum, impacting equipment like radars and communication links. Electronic media plays a significant role in influencing populations, with many Iraqis preferring foreign satellite news stations over government-run broadcasts. The Iraqi Governing Council's restriction on certain news outlets in 2004 led to perceptions of information manipulation by the Coalition Provisional Authority. Terrorist groups are challenging traditional media through the Internet. Terrorist groups are using the Internet to challenge traditional media's control over mass communications. They spread their messages quickly and saturate cyberspace, utilizing Internet specialists and global servers. Al-Qaeda relies on a Global Islamic Media Unit for public outreach. Cyber-based threats against US information infrastructures are a growing concern for national security, with attacks on government systems increasing by 40% in 2008. The low cost and anonymity of operating in cyberspace make it an attractive option for adversaries unable to engage in symmetrical warfare against the United States. Attacks on US government systems increased by 40% in 2008, with sustained assaults for nearly a decade. \"Moonlight Maze\" attacks in 1999 compromised sensitive military data from a mainframe in Russia. \"Titan Rain\" cyberattacks in 2003 targeted DOD systems and contractors, suspected to originate from China. No classified systems were breached, but sensitive information was copied. In 2006, a cyberattack on the U.S. Naval War College led to the campus being disconnected from the Internet. The Pentagon also faced a similar attack in 2007, prompting a temporary disconnection of part of the unclassified network. Lt. General Charles Croom warned of cyber attackers potentially disrupting American military operations. Adversaries like China, Russia, and non-state terrorist groups are developing capabilities to attack U.S. networks. \"Titan Rain\" demonstrated successful attacks on non-classified military systems, believed to be directed by foreign governments. China has downloaded 10 to 20 terabytes of data from the NIPRNet, enhancing its information operations capabilities. Estonia's move of a Soviet-era war memorial led to DDOS attacks on national websites. Estonia's infrastructure heavily relies on information technology, making it the most \"wired\" country in Europe. Cyberattacks disrupted basic services to Estonian citizens, initially blamed on the Russian government. NATO sent experts to protect government systems and assist in recovery. Analysts later found the attacks to be spontaneous and widespread, originating from various sources globally. The DDOS attack code was shared in Russian chat rooms, fueled by emotional discussions on the relocation of a Soviet-era war memorial. The cyber attacks on Estonia did not target critical infrastructure or make extortion demands. Analysts found no Russian government connection to the attacks. In Georgia, internet service providers were targeted with coordinated cyber attacks, originating from Russian hacking forums. The attacks exploited software vulnerabilities and could be conducted with a single computer. The Georgian government blocked internet traffic from Russia to mitigate the attacks. In Kyrgyzstan, cyber attacks targeted internet service providers, causing the country to go offline. The attacks were believed to be linked to a Russian \"cyber militia\" and may have been motivated by Russia's displeasure with a U.S. air base in Kyrgyzstan and the opposition party in the country. Identifying the attackers accurately and in a timely manner remains a challenge after such incidents. The trend towards cyberattacks for political manipulation raises questions about international conduct in cyberspace. The attack on Estonia questioned if it constituted an \"armed attack\" under NATO's Article 5. Currently, network protection is seen as a national responsibility, but issues of sovereignty, attribution, and response thresholds persist. Rules of engagement for cyber operations are expected to align with the law of Armed Conflict, ensuring proportional responses to cyber attacks. Military forces are adapting to the new task of defending against cyber threats and developing offensive capabilities for retaliatory strikes. The DOD uses classified offensive tools for retaliatory cyber strikes against enemy systems. Reactive defense is ineffective against powerful cyber attacks, so a proactive approach is needed. Accurate attribution is crucial for deciding on retaliation. Most cyber attacks on DOD systems are suspected to originate from China for cyber espionage purposes. The legality of responding to malicious cyber behavior requires clear definitions of activity, actors, and jurisdictions. Labeling cyber incidents as \"cybercrime\" or \"cyberterrorism\" can be problematic due to difficulties in identifying the attacker's identity, intent, and political motivations. Various definitions exist for \"cyberterrorism,\" with some experts defining it as politically motivated hacking operations intended to cause harm. Cyberterrorism is defined as unlawful attacks against computers to intimidate or coerce a government for political or social objectives. It can involve physical attacks on critical infrastructures without using a keyboard. Cybercrime involves crimes enabled by computers, such as theft of intellectual property or violation of patent laws. No reported acts of cyberterrorism have been documented to date. Cybercrime encompasses theft of intellectual property through patent, trade secret, or copyright violations, as well as attacks to disrupt computer processing or espionage for unauthorized data copies. Cyberattacks for criminal or terrorist purposes differ in intent, with identity theft being a common form of cybercrime driven by financial gain. Malicious software like botnets can aid cybercriminals in stealing personal information, costing American businesses and consumers $50 billion annually. Users are often tricked into clicking on malicious links in emails or websites, enabling cybercriminals to gather personal data. Malicious software enables cybercriminals to gather personal information from users' computers, leading to identity theft. This stolen information is used to create false identity documents, such as driver's licenses and bank statements. Inadequate computer security practices within organizations also contribute to identity theft cases involving thousands of victims. For example, in 2005, over 40 million credit card numbers of U.S. consumers were accessed by hackers, leading to fraudulent charges on statements and potential victims of fraud at banks like UFJ in Japan. In June 2006, officials acknowledged theft of personal information belonging to over 1,500 NNSA employees. Stolen credit card numbers and bank account information are traded online. Services for each stolen MasterCard number cost between $42 and $72 in 2005. By 2007, a stolen credit card number sells online for $1, and a complete identity sells for $14 to $18. Identity theft continues to be a problem, with government systems like monster.com and the Federal Aviation Administration experiencing data breaches. Laws require businesses to notify affected individuals and improve security measures. Harmonization of federal and state laws may be needed for more uniform protections. FISMA's requirements have agencies focused on meeting deadlines rather than investing in added security measures. In February 2009, the Air Force shut down internet access at Maxwell Air Force Base in response to an intrusion, emphasizing the importance of information assurance. The Army announced a breach of a database containing personal information about nearly 1,600 soldiers participating in Operation Tribute to Freedom. Cyberespionage involves unauthorized probing and data exfiltration. Industrial and military espionage qualify as cyberespionage. Technology has outpaced policy in labeling actions in cyberspace. U.S. counterintelligence officials report foreign intelligence organizations regularly attempt to hack into U.S. systems. Cyberespionage has transformed counterintelligence by enabling reduced reliance on traditional methods. The Internet has transformed counterintelligence, reducing reliance on traditional spying. In 2001, the US was accused of using the Echelon electronic spy network for industrial espionage. Echelon, established during the Cold War, is a global spy system capable of intercepting communications worldwide. Former CIA director justified US industrial espionage based on bribery by European companies. European officials expressed outrage at the justification. Some government officials warn about the increasing threat of cyberespionage and the potential damage to U.S. national security. Security experts emphasize the need for stronger government agency computer security practices. A 2005 IBM report revealed over 237 million security attacks globally, with government agencies being the primary target. Malicious actors in cyberspace do not differentiate between military and civilian targets. In 2005, financial services and healthcare sectors faced millions of cyber attacks. Government agencies and industries in the United States were the main targets, followed by New Zealand and China. The connection between terrorist groups and cyber criminals allows for international expansion. The 2005 U.K. bombings and 2007 car bombing attempts show terrorists utilizing communication networks and IT resources. London police suspect terrorists obtained explosives for the 2005 U.K. bombings from criminal groups in Eastern Europe. A trial in the U.K. linked Islamic terrorist groups to cybercrime. Three British residents were sentenced for using stolen credit cards to purchase items for jihadists, including night vision goggles, tents, GPS devices, prepaid cell phones, and airline tickets. They also used stolen credit cards to register internet domains and launder money through online gambling sites, totaling over $3.5 million in fraudulent charges. Cybercriminals have made alliances with drug traffickers in regions like Afghanistan and the Middle East, using stolen credit card numbers to support terrorist groups. Drug traffickers use encryption for Internet messaging and hire computer specialists to evade law enforcement, coordinate drug shipments, and launder money. Major narcotics markets in Western Europe and North America serve the trafficking needs of criminal and terrorist groups. U.S. officials reported that many foreign terrorist organizations are involved in drug trafficking, with Islamic extremist groups increasingly participating in this illegal activity. The growing involvement of Islamic terrorist and extremist groups in drug trafficking is a concern, with limited evidence of cooperation between different terrorist groups in drug and arms trafficking. DEA officials argue that the war on drugs and terrorism should be linked. Terrorist groups may use drug trafficking for financing and weakening enemies. The poppy crop in Afghanistan supplies most of the world's heroin, supporting a $3.1 billion drug trade used to fund terrorist groups. U.S. intelligence reports suggest that \"al Qaeda in Afghanistan\" has regained strength and may pose a threat to Western countries. Drug traffickers hire computer specialists from former Soviet Union and Indian subcontinent to use technologies for encrypted Internet messages, allowing terrorist organizations to operate internationally with less detection. Some specialists may be unaware of employers' political objectives or provide assistance due to limited legitimate job opportunities. Links between hackers and terrorists are hard to confirm, with exclusive hacker groups sharing sophisticated tools secretly to operate effectively. Some hacker groups operate covertly for political, profit, or criminal motives, selling information on computer vulnerabilities in a black market. Prices range from $150 to $5,000, with buyers including organized crime, foreign governments, and spam companies. Advanced cyberattacks may require years of preparation, involving target surveillance and testing of new hacker tools. Hackers may spend 2 to 10 years preparing for cyberattacks, similar to the planning seen in physical terrorist attacks by groups like Al Qaeda. It is uncertain if international terrorist groups have the interest or capability to launch effective cyberattacks. Some believe that terrorist groups may use cyberattacks to supplement traditional attacks, while others think post-industrial societies are more likely to engage in cyberterrorism. Cyberterrorism groups like Al Qaeda operate in post-industrial societies, using technology for organizational secrecy and communication. Al Qaeda members have extensively used the Internet for planning attacks, with some using encryption to protect their data. Tighter physical security measures in the United States may lead terrorist groups to consider cyberattacks as a way to lower the risk of detection. However, some experts believe that cyberattacks may not have the same immediate impact as conventional attacks. There are concerns about potential attacks on critical infrastructures like the electric grid or SCADA systems, either through kinetic or cyber means. Cybercrime is also a significant international concern. The Convention on Cybercrime, adopted in 2001 by the Council of Europe, is the primary international treaty dealing with cyber law breaches. Participating countries are required to update their criminal laws against hacking, copyright infringements, fraud, child pornography, and other cyber activities. The United States signed and ratified the Convention but did not sign a separate protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism on the Internet due to Constitutional issues. The United States signed and ratified the Convention on Cybercrime in 2001 but did not sign a separate protocol criminalizing xenophobia and racism on the Internet due to Constitutional issues. The Department of Justice deemed it unconstitutional to sign the additional protocol, citing the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of expression. Despite objections from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution of ratification for the Convention in 2006. The U.S. will comply with the Convention based on existing federal law, with no new legislation expected to be required. Legal analysts believe that U.S. negotiators successfully removed objectionable provisions, aligning the Convention closely with existing U.S. laws. Department of Defense officials have noted the threat of cyber attacks as being \"less likely\" than physical attacks. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 required the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate efforts to protect the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. Despite numerous reports highlighting the urgent need to improve cybersecurity, there is a lack of national urgency to address the gap between cybersecurity and the threat of cyber attacks. Some experts argue that security is not a priority and is often treated as an afterthought in federal agencies. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported that cybersecurity risks have increased for infrastructure control systems due to interconnections with the Internet and lack of coordination in improving computer security across federal agencies and the private sector. Observers warn that remote systems controlling critical infrastructure are vulnerable to cybercrime, but decision-makers may underestimate this threat. Some researchers argue that decision-makers may not see cybersecurity as a significant threat, despite past reports urging improvement. They believe that current decision-makers do not feel the costs of inaction and suggest that IT vendors, researchers, and purchasers must prioritize cybersecurity. The Air Force is focusing on building capabilities for cyber operations, as stated in their new mission in 2008. The U.S. Air Force's new mission includes fighting in air, space, and cyberspace, defending against malicious activity online and across the electromagnetic spectrum. Plans for a new Air Force Cyber Command were discussed in a cyberwarfare-themed summit in 2006, focusing on expanding capabilities for cyber operations and homeland security. The Air Force Cyber Command was initially planned to focus on defending telecommunications systems, utilities, and transportation. However, it was later decided that a new major command for cyberspace operations would not be developed. Instead, a component-Numbered Air Force, the 24th Air Force, led by a 2-star general, will focus on cyberspace warfighting operations in support of NORTHCOM and STRATCOM missions. The AFCYBER team will assist in transitioning the work to Air Force Space Command. The provisional team will assist in transitioning work to the Space Command and other tasks as needed until the new organizational structure is formalized. There may be a new major command for cyberspace in the future, potentially a stand-alone combatant command. The U.S. Strategic Command currently controls military information operations, space command, and Computer Network Operations, with plans for future command relationships still being decided. The USSTRATCOM includes several Joint Functional Component Commands (JFCCs) responsible for various aspects of cyber security and defense. This includes JFCC-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW) and JFCC-Space & Global Strike (JFCC-SGS) overseeing DOD cyber security, Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) defending against cyber attacks, and Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC) coordinating information operations. The need for qualified Electronic Warfare operators is increasing as more military systems become computerized and interconnected. The President's Comprehensive National Cyber-security Initiative emphasizes cyber education and training as a critical focus area. In a recent speech, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordan England highlighted the declining number of scientists and engineers in the U.S. and the growing need for qualified Electronic Warfare operators. The DOD conducts a Cyber Defense Exercise annually to enhance cyber skills, with a focus on hacking into and protecting test networks. Efforts are being made to integrate cyber warfare into Joint Professional Military Education curriculum, despite challenges such as the classified nature of cyberspace doctrine and the presence of international students. DOD emphasizes the importance of attracting, training, and retaining skilled information technology professionals. The Air Force Research Laboratory Cyber Operations Branch offers a 10-week summer program for university students in cyber security. The program, called ACE Cyber Security Boot Camp, includes intensive studies in legal and policy issues, cryptography, computer network defense and attack, steganography, and analysis of malicious code. Students also participate in internships at the Air Force Research Laboratory or with local industry partners. The ACE program offers internships at the Air Force Research Laboratory and officer development activities. Faculty is from Syracuse University, West Point, and Norwich University. ACE is recognized by DHS and NSF for the Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service program. Graduates work for federal agencies. ACE graduates are employed at various agencies. Syracuse University offers cyber security courses in high schools in multiple states. High school students completing cyber security courses can earn Syracuse college credits in computer science. DOD contracts with Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute for CERT-CC to protect U.S. commerce online. DHS operates US-CERT with private industry to monitor cyber threats and provide recovery guidance. The Defense Information Systems Agency oversees the military's Global Information Grid for net-centric operations. Joint Staff J-6 is working on an initiative for cyber defense. The Joint Staff J-6 is working on an initiative called \"GiG 2.0\" to improve security postures and interoperability among service infrastructures by creating a joint DOD enterprise. The federal government has taken steps to enhance computer security through FISMA and the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. The OMB has mandated that all U.S. Government networks enable IPv6 to handle traffic, improving address assignment and network security. Federal agencies support IPv6 but full transition is a future goal. The NCSD oversees CSTARC for cyber threat analysis and response, while CWIN aids in information sharing and cybersecurity incidents. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) has implemented the Cyber Warning and Information Network (CWIN) in 50 locations to serve as an early warning system for cyberattacks. CWIN is designed to be reliable and independent of the Internet or public switched network (PSN). Additionally, the NCSD created the National Cyber Alert System (NCAS) in 2004 to distribute information on emerging vulnerabilities and cyberthreats. The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) was launched in 2008 by then president George W. Bush to prioritize and coordinate cyber defense efforts across the government. The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) was launched in 2008 to prioritize and coordinate cyber defense efforts across the government. The initiative was prompted by the Director of National Intelligence and led by ODNI's Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force. The Obama administration continued this effort with a 60-day cybersecurity review led by Melissa Hathaway. DHS is the lead agency for the Federal Government's cybersecurity, coordinating government and private-sector efforts through its National Cyber Security Center (NCSC). There are debates over whether NSA should run the government's cybersecurity efforts, with some citing NSA's technological talent and capabilities, while critics raise concerns about civil liberties violations and erosion of public trust. Critics argue that having one agency in charge of all cyber efforts will erode public trust and hinder cooperation with the private sector. There are concerns about inadequate funding and lack of leadership authority within DHS's cyber programs. The resignation of the NCSC director over NSA dominance in cybersecurity efforts highlights these issues. Experts have echoed these concerns in congressional hearings, suggesting the need for reform in the national security structure. The curr_chunk discusses the need to improve cybersecurity measures, including determining appropriate responses to cyberattacks, enhancing security education, and coordinating efforts between private industry and government. It also mentions the importance of harmonizing federal and state laws related to data breaches and the potential challenges in responding to cyberattacks from terrorist groups. The potential consequences of the United States using cyberweapons are examined, including the difficulty in controlling their effects, the risk of encouraging other entities to launch cyberattacks, and the possibility of violating international laws. The vulnerability of U.S. weapons systems to cyberattacks is also highlighted. The curr_chunk discusses the vulnerability of military forces and national security to cyberattacks in commercial software systems. It questions the effectiveness of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in incentivizing security objectives and suggests requiring software certification for federal agencies. It also debates the need for regulation to ensure best security practices and the slow public response to improving computer security. The curr_chunk discusses the debate around improving computer security through regulations and market forces. Former cybersecurity advisers have differing views on the role of government in cybersecurity, with some experts emphasizing the need for better training for system administrators. The question of whether software vendors should be required to create more secure products is also raised. Ultimately, the focus is on reducing the threat to national security. The need for a strong commitment by government and the private sector to follow best management practices to improve computer security is emphasized. A 2004 survey revealed that most home PC users lack adequate protection against hackers and are confused about security measures. The challenge lies in providing computer security training to all users to keep them aware of evolving threats and encourage proper security procedures. Improving information sharing between government entities and the private sector is crucial for effective cybersecurity. The private sector seeks classified threat information from the government to protect against cyberattacks. Companies hesitate to report successful intrusions to avoid publicity and protect trade secrets. Cooperation between nations is crucial to combat cybercrime, but legal and political conflicts can complicate hacker pursuit. Thirty-eight countries, including the US, participate in the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime aims to combat cybercrime by harmonizing national laws and improving international cooperation. Legislation such as the Internet Spyware Prevention Act of 2007 and the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 have been introduced to address cybersecurity issues. The bill passed in the House on May 9, 2007, aims to protect communications from terrorist attacks and disasters by establishing a capability to identify threats to critical information infrastructure, conducting risk assessments, developing a plan for cyber attacks, defining cyber incidents of national significance, and promoting cybersecurity awareness. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security on May 11, 2007. The Smart Grid Facilitation Act of 2007 aimed to modernize the electricity transmission system with digital technology for cybersecurity protection. It proposed the establishment of the Grid Modernization Commission to facilitate the adoption of Smart Grid standards nationwide. This bill became law on July 30, 2008. The Act for Fiscal Year 2008, known as P.L. 110-181, mandated a quadrennial roles and missions review for the Department of Defense, including cyber operations. The Secretary of Defense was required to submit a report to congressional defense committees within 180 days, covering legal authorities, information sharing policies, organizational structure, operational challenges, coordination with various sectors, and training for cyberspace operations. Recommendations included the potential establishment of a single joint organization for cyberspace operations. The DOD Roles and Missions Review report highlighted the importance of cyberspace operations and the potential for major combat operations in this domain. Questions arise regarding the legality of provocative actions such as intelligence gathering using cyber tools. Retaliatory cyber or electronic warfare counterstrikes raise concerns about civilian involvement and justification for attacks on foreign governments. The DOD is facing questions about the legality and implications of cyber operations, including the use of propaganda to manipulate public opinion. Concerns also arise about the potential impact of global media on military missions and the need to navigate the complexities of engaging in Information Operations. The DOD Information Operations Roadmap highlights the challenge of controlling PSYOP messages intended for foreign audiences that are consumed by the U.S. domestic audience through global media. Information is a valuable resource enhanced by technology, enabling the military to achieve information superiority and translate it into combat power. DOD Information Operations, also known as Information Operations (IO), focus on disrupting or influencing an adversary's decision-making processes during crisis or conflict. This includes actions such as transmitting viruses to slow computers, overheating circuitry to disable weapons, and broadcasting false signals to misdirect sensors. Other methods include psychological operations and seizing control of network communications. Computer Network Defense (CND) is used to protect U.S. forces against cyber threats. DOD places new emphasis on dominating the electromagnetic spectrum with methods for computer network attack and electronic warfare, recognizing the importance of networks in modern warfare. Psychological Operations and public diplomacy are crucial in countering adversaries' use of the Internet and social media. DOD identifies five core capabilities for information operations in Joint Publication 3-13. The Department of Defense (DOD) emphasizes dominating the electromagnetic spectrum for information operations, including Psychological Operations (PSYOP) to influence foreign audiences. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, messages were broadcast to Iraqi leaders to sway their support. The use of the Internet by terrorist groups poses a challenge, with Al Jazeera considered a competitor to U.S. PSYOP. The Department of Defense (DOD) is focusing on improving Psychological Operations (PSYOP) to counter competitive civilian news media like Al Jazeera. PSYOP products must be based on audience decision-making processes and disseminated rapidly to targeted audiences. While PSYOP is intended for foreign audiences, the global media may pick up these messages and replay them to the U.S. domestic audience. Military Deception (MILDEC) guides enemies into making mistakes through false information. Military Deception (MILDEC) involves presenting false information to mislead enemy decision makers, while Operational Security (OPSEC) focuses on protecting critical information from adversaries. Computer Network Operations (CNO) include attacking enemy networks, defending our own systems, and exploiting enemy networks for intelligence collection. The Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC) and the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCCNW) are responsible for Computer Network Attack, with highly classified capabilities believed to include destroying networks, stealing data, and penetrating enemy computers. Personnel from various agencies and allied nations are involved. The Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) is under the Defense Information Security Agency (DISA) and will be moved to the National Security Agency for combined defensive and operational capabilities. The Agency is combining defensive and operational capabilities. CND involves protecting information, computers, and networks from unauthorized activity. DOD officials are concerned about the lack of policy and legal analysis for appropriate responses to intrusions. A legal review is recommended to determine the level of intrusion that constitutes an attack and clarify self-defense actions. The Department of Defense (DOD) is recommended to establish a legal framework for domestic and foreign cyber attacks. Cyber Network Exploitation (CNE) involves intelligence gathering through network tools, while Cyber Network Attack (CNA) aims to disrupt or destroy information in computers and networks. CNE tools are similar to those used for attacks but are configured for intelligence collection. It is unclear if methods used for CNE could also be used for attacks by adversaries. Cyber Network Attack (CNA) relies on a data stream as a weapon to execute attacks, such as sending a digital signal to shut off power flow. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces did not carry out planned CNA missions due to delayed top-level approval. A cyber attack against Iraqi financial computers was rejected to avoid disrupting a connected European financial communications network. According to Pentagon sources, a cyber attack on Iraq could have caused disruptions to banks and ATM machines in Europe due to global network interconnections. US forces faced challenges in designing a cyber attack limited to military targets only. In January 2003, White House officials sought input on cyber-warfare guidelines at MIT. The Bush Administration announced guidance in February 2003 for launching computer network attacks against foreign adversaries. National Security Presidential Directive 16 clarifies the circumstances for justifying and authorizing disabling computer attacks. The Electronic Warfare Division of the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office is responsible for creating electronic warfare policy and developing new electromagnetic spectrum concepts for equipment and weapons. The Department of Defense emphasizes maximum control of the electromagnetic spectrum to disrupt communication systems, sensors, and weapons. This includes navigation warfare and offensive space operations. The Electronic Warfare Division of the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office focuses on creating electronic warfare policy and developing new electromagnetic spectrum concepts for equipment and weapons. This includes methods to disrupt communication systems, sensors, and weapons, such as offensive space operations and controlling adversary radio systems. Military IO testing involves secretly entering enemy computer networks, manipulating radar systems to show false images, and using non-kinetic weapons like High Power Microwave (HPM) beams for disabling enemy missiles or crowd control. The Active Denial System (ADS) is a nonlethal, counter-personnel directed energy weapon developed by the Air Force. The Active Denial System (ADS) is a nonlethal, vehicle-mounted directed energy weapon developed by the Air Force. It projects millimeter energy waves to create a burning sensation on an adversary's skin, repelling them without causing injury. The ADS is safe and effective at ranges between 50 and 1,600 feet, designed to protect the innocent and minimize fatalities. Approximately $40 million has been spent on this technology over the past ten years. Military officials requested ADS devices to be deployed to Iraq for crowd control and protecting convoys, but deployment has been delayed due to political concerns. The ADS system, developed by the Air Force, is a directed-energy weapon for counter-personnel missions, set to be operational before 2010."
