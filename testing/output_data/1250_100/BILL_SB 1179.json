    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"family member,\" \"firefighter,\" \"interment right,\" and \"nonresident.\" These terms encompass relationships, firefighter definition, rights for plot use and memorial markers, and residency status within a district. Chapter 5.5 (9069.10-9069.15) of the Health and Safety Code outlines interment rights in public cemetery districts, specifying that disinterment of human remains requires consent from the cemetery district and the surviving spouse, child, parent, or sibling. The chapter also allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances. The cemetery district must maintain records of removal of remains, including date, person's name, cemetery and plot information, reinterment details if applicable, and alternate disposition if remains are not reinterred. The person removing the remains must provide a complete record to the cemetery district. An interment right provides a transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records, allowing for designation of who may be interred in the plot. The owner must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. Compliance with state and local laws and district policies is required for use of the interment right. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. A surviving spouse, registered domestic partner, child, parent, or heir can waive their interment right for another relative. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership based on an affidavit, they are not liable unless they had actual knowledge of false information. Upon the sale of a plot in a cemetery, the successor owner must sign an affidavit affirming their entitlement to the interment right, efforts to locate other claimants, and lack of opposition. The district must inform buyers of interment rights and their policies. The act does not require reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
