    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress acknowledges the critical role of the FDA in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases, utilizing innovative drug development strategies. The FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for unmet medical needs, including rare diseases, using modern scientific tools. This can lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising safety standards. Patients benefit from faster access to innovative therapies for serious diseases. The FDA should enhance its authority to expedite the development and access to novel treatments for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases. Congress supports applying accelerated approval and fast track provisions to help expedite treatments while maintaining safety standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. The Secretary will expedite the review of new drugs intended for serious or life-threatening diseases if they address unmet medical needs. Sponsors can request designation as a fast track product, which must be determined within 60 days. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product if it meets certain criteria, expediting the development and review process for approval. The Secretary may also approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on specific endpoints, such as surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints. The FDA may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on specific clinical endpoints that can predict clinical benefit. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to verify the product's effects and submission of promotional materials. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently or if predicted clinical benefits are not verified. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently or if predicted clinical benefits are not verified. The Secretary may review incomplete applications for approval of a fast track product if preliminary evaluation suggests effectiveness, with the sponsor providing necessary information and paying required fees. The Secretary may review incomplete applications for approval of fast track products if preliminary evaluation suggests effectiveness, with the sponsor providing necessary information and paying required fees. Awareness efforts include developing and disseminating information on accelerated approval and fast track products, as well as establishing a program to encourage the development of scientific methods to predict clinical benefit. The application is likely to predict clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions with significant unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance and amendments to regulations within one year of the draft guidance. Considerations include issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires guidance on novel approaches for reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence, especially for diseases with low prevalence. The issuance of guidance or regulations should not delay the review or approval of designation requests or drug applications. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW.\n\nThe Secretary will contract an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with various stakeholders will be included.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThe amendments encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
