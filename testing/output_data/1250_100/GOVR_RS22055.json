    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. Attorneys' fees provisions were added in 1986 and amended in 1997 and 2004. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization involved different approaches to attorneys' fees in the House and Senate bills. The final law aligned more with the Senate version, allowing attorneys' fees for the state or local educational agency in certain situations. Complaint and appeals procedures remained similar, with the addition of the local educational agency being able to file a complaint. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded in certain situations, including when a parent's complaint is deemed frivolous or for an improper purpose. Senator Grassley emphasized that this amendment does not discourage legitimate complaints against school districts. Senator Gregg emphasized the need for an attorneys' fee amendment to provide relief from abuses of due process rights in IDEA and ensure taxpayer dollars are used for educating children, not for trial lawyers. He cited the standard from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where prevailing defendants can recover fees if a plaintiff's actions are frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. This high standard aims to protect defendants from burdensome litigation without legal or factual basis. The attorneys' fee provision in the Senate debate was drawn from Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, applying an objective standard of reasonableness to the facts of the case. Attorneys' fees are based on prevailing community rates, with specific prohibitions and reductions in fee amounts. Fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer under certain circumstances. The 2004 reauthorization added a requirement for a \"resolution session\" prior to a due process hearing, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Attorneys' fees are not allowable for the resolution session. P.L. 108-446 allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to a prevailing parent if justified in rejecting a settlement offer, with possible reductions in certain circumstances. The hourly rate for attorneys providing similar services must be reasonable. Attorneys' fees may be reduced if services were excessive or if necessary information was not provided in the due process complaint. Exceptions exist, such as when the final resolution was unreasonably delayed by the SEA or LEA. The final regulations for P.L. 108-446 were issued in 2006. The Department of Education (ED) declined to address whether non-attorney advocates could receive fees for advising parents at due process hearings, citing that lay advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys. This decision was influenced by the Supreme Court's ruling in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy, which stated that explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees must be included in legislation, which was not done in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA. As a result, ED did not add a regulatory provision on the subject."
