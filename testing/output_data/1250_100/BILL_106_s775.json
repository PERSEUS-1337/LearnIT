    "content": "The Act titled \"Right To Know About Airport Pollution Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of addressing airport pollution. Congress finds that the serious pollution problems related to airport operations, including ground level ozone, noise, water pollution, and solid waste disposal, require thorough evaluation. The Clean Air Act mandates states to reduce emissions contributing to ground level ozone and study the effects of sporadic noise on public health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act regulates discharges into waters, the Safe Drinking Water Act establishes drinking water standards, and the Solid Waste Disposal Act addresses solid waste management. The Airport Bubble Concept is an approach that treats airports and the surrounding area as a single source of pollution, aiming to reduce emissions through specific programs or regulations. The purpose of this Act is to require a feasibility study for applying airport bubbles. The Administrator will conduct a feasibility study on applying airport bubbles to assess and reduce pollution in and around airports, as well as study air pollutant emission standards for airplane engines. The Administrator will conduct a feasibility study on airport bubbles to identify and reduce pollution sources in and around airports. The Administrator will conduct a study to determine the feasibility of regulating pollution from all sources in and around airports using airport bubbles, consulting with a diverse working group including representatives from various organizations and agencies. The study will involve representatives from various organizations and agencies familiar with emissions testing, repair records, traffic conditions, and environmental specialists at airports. Required elements include analyzing information on air, noise, and water pollution sources. The study will analyze a variety of pollution sources within airport bubbles in the United States, including aircraft, vehicles, and equipment. It will consider relevant information from State implementation plans and airport master plans, assess air quality implications of airport operations, and evaluate the environmental and economic impact of regulating airports as significant sources of pollution. The study will analyze pollution sources within airport bubbles in the United States, propose boundaries, define air pollutant emissions, develop an inventory of pollution sources, evaluate programs for pollution reduction, and assess the feasibility of regulating pollutants in and around airports using airport bubbles. The study will analyze pollution sources within airport bubbles in the United States, propose boundaries, define air pollutant emissions, develop an inventory of pollution sources, evaluate programs for pollution reduction, and assess the feasibility of regulating pollutants in and around airports using airport bubbles. The Administrator will make recommendations on effective implementation of airport bubble methodology and address unique air and noise pollution issues at military air bases. A report describing the study results and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will conduct a study to assess the feasibility of strengthening air pollutant emission standards for airplane engines. A report on the study results and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Progress reports on the implementation of sections 4 and 5 will be submitted annually. Additionally, there will be reporting requirements for toxic chemical releases. SEC. 7. REPORTING OF TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASES.\n\nThe Administrator must establish regulations within 180 days for airports serving commercial or military jet aircraft to report toxic chemical releases and waste management activities. This includes chemicals used during aircraft operation, maintenance, and other airport activities. Airports will be considered facilities for reporting purposes.\n\nSEC. 8. FUNDING. The Administrator will implement the Act using existing funds available."
