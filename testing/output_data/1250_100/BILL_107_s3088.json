    "content": "The Act titled \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" ensures that federal employees in the uniformed services or National Guard will not have their pay reduced while performing active service. The \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" guarantees that federal employees serving in the uniformed services or National Guard will not have their pay reduced during active duty. This includes receiving basic pay for each pay period they would have received if their civilian employment had not been interrupted. The \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" ensures that federal employees on active duty in the uniformed services or National Guard will not have their pay reduced. This includes maintaining their entitlement to reemployment rights under chapter 43 of title 38 and receiving basic pay from their employing agency. The \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" requires federal agencies to continue paying employees on active duty in the uniformed services or National Guard from the same funds and in the same manner as if they were in a pay status. The Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, will establish regulations for implementation. Agencies must ensure that the rights under this act apply to their employees, and the Federal Aviation Administration must also establish procedures for its employees. The terms 'employee', 'Federal Government', and 'uniformed services' have the same meanings as in section 4303 of title 38. The \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" defines key terms such as 'service in the uniformed services', 'employing agency', and 'basic pay'. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections for chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code. The amendments made by the \"Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act of 2002\" ensure nonreduction in pay for those serving in the uniformed services or National Guard. The effective date for these changes is pay periods beginning on or after September 11, 2001. Additionally, a new section, \"SEC. 45G. READY RESERVE-NATIONAL GUARD EMPLOYEE CREDIT,\" is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a credit for Ready Reserve-National Guard employees. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit under section 38 is 50% of the actual compensation amount for the taxable year. The actual compensation amount is the compensation paid while the employee is on qualified active duty. The credit is limited to a maximum of 12 months and does not apply on days when the employee was not scheduled to work. Qualified active duty is defined as specific military service. The term 'qualified active duty' refers to active duty excluding training duty, entitling an employee to reemployment rights, benefits, or leave under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, and hospitalization related to such duty. 'Compensation' is any remuneration for employment deductible from gross income under section 162(a)(1). 'Ready Reserve-National Guard employee' is an employee who meets specific criteria. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit is part of the general business credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit is determined under section 45G(a) and is applicable to employees who are members of the Ready Reserve or the National Guard. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001."
