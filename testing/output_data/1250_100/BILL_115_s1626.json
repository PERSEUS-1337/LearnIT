    "content": "The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" defines a \"commercial air carrier\" as an air carrier operating under specific regulations. The Act also requires training for responding to smoke or fume incidents on aircraft. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" mandates training for flight attendants, pilots, maintenance technicians, and first responders on responding to smoke or fume incidents on aircraft. Training includes identifying sources of smoke and fumes, recognizing potential hazards, and procedures for response. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" requires reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on board aircraft to the Federal Aviation Administration. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" mandates reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft to the Federal Aviation Administration. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft and establish a system for submitting and accessing these reports. The standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft includes sections for identifying the flight, aircraft details, smoke or fire information, fumes description, location, engine details, flight phase, crew symptoms, and other observations. The standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft includes details on symptoms reported by crew members and passengers, use of supplemental oxygen, effects on flight operation, and post-incident maintenance work. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will compile and make these forms available to the public quarterly, with personally identifiable information redacted. Additionally, a publicly searchable database of incident information will be available on a website. The reporting of incidents of smoke or fumes on board aircraft operated by commercial air carriers includes materials for public disclosure, crew training, and detailed statistics on incidents disaggregated by various criteria. SEC. 5. INVESTIGATIONS. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must prescribe regulations for conducting investigations within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Investigations must gather information from various personnel involved in incidents, collect reports, examine technical findings on components, and identify the incident's cause. When investigating incidents, the Federal Aviation Administration consults with the air carrier, works with technical representatives, and invites collective bargaining representatives to participate. SEC. 6. BLEED AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT. The Federal Aviation Administration mandates commercial air carriers to install carbon monoxide detectors on bleed air streams in various locations on aircraft within a specified timeframe. The detectors must continuously monitor carbon monoxide levels and alert the pilot and flight attendants if limits are exceeded. Pilots are required to report any alarms as per regulations. The Federal Aviation Administration mandates carbon monoxide detectors on aircraft to monitor levels and alert crew. Pilots must report alarms, and regulations require manufacturers to include procedures in manuals. Research continues for technologies to detect bleed air contamination. The Federal Aviation Administration mandates carbon monoxide detectors on aircraft to monitor levels and alert crew. Pilots must report alarms, and regulations require manufacturers to include procedures in manuals. Research continues for technologies to detect bleed air contamination. Rule of Construction: An investigation under section 5 is necessary even if the carbon monoxide detector alarm is not activated. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Federal Aviation Administration for the implementation of this Act. Helicopters are excluded from the provisions of this Act."
