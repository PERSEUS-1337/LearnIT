    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency, including tax incentives. The federal government is still determining the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the US was by the residential sector. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years on a per capita and aggregate basis. Since the 1970s, residential energy use per capita has been relatively constant, but starting in the mid- to late-2000s, it began to trend downward. Efficiency gains have allowed for flat or slightly declining aggregate residential energy use despite increasing energy-demanding technologies. Experts believe there is still potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector, with some debate on the optimal level of investment. Tax credits are one policy option to promote residential energy efficiency. The report discusses residential energy-efficiency tax credits, market failures, and barriers that hinder optimal investment in energy-efficient technologies. It also provides an economic analysis of tax incentives for residential energy efficiency and policy options. Taxpayers can claim credits for energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy technologies for the 2017 tax year. The residential energy-efficiency tax credits for 2017 allow taxpayers to claim a credit for building envelope improvements and energy-efficient appliances purchased for their primary residence. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of each energy-efficient property, capped at $500. The Section 25C credit expired at the end of 2017, while the residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D) allows for credits on renewable energy properties. The Section 25D credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for renewable energy properties installed on their residence, such as solar panels and geothermal heat pumps. The credit rate is 30% for 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021 before expiring. There is no cap on the maximum value of the credit. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. Consumers may not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency due to market failures and barriers, despite potential cost savings. The Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not fully address these issues, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Market failures, such as externalities and informational issues, can explain suboptimal investment in residential energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities, like pollution costs, may lead to underallocation of resources. Lower electricity prices due to lack of reflecting environmental consequences result in overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Positive externalities can occur through the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. The adoption of emerging technologies, such as solar panels, can lead to knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Market failures, like the principal-agent problem, can hinder energy efficiency investments in residential properties. Landlords and builders may underinvest in energy efficiency due to disconnects in incentives. Capital market imperfections and lack of information about energy-saving technologies can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency in residential properties. Low-income households, who are more credit constrained, may settle for less energy-efficient alternatives due to high initial costs. Uncertainty about future energy prices can also make consumers reluctant to invest in energy-efficient technologies. Government policies can help enhance market functioning in this area. Government policies can enhance market functioning by addressing market failures or barriers in energy efficiency investments. Options include tax incentives, grants, rebates, credit enhancements, regulations, mandates, and informational programs like Energy Star labeling. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, while other incentives like the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D, as well as the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit, aim to reduce the cost of energy-efficient investments and products. While tax incentives can encourage additional investment in energy efficiency, they may not be the most economically efficient policy option if markets underinvest due to artificially low electricity prices. In such cases, allowing electricity prices to fully reflect costs could be a more efficient approach. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs can encourage investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Tax incentives like Section 25C and Section 25D do not directly address the principal-agent problem for renters and landlords. Other incentives, such as the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, are more effective in addressing market imperfections. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively help homeowners facing credit constraints. Subsidizing efficiency through tax credits can benefit consumers lacking information on energy-efficient technologies. However, recent research suggests that tax credits may not be necessary for well-informed consumers, leading to windfall gains. Targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies may maximize the benefits of tax credits. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits aim to promote investment in residential energy-efficient property but may not address all market failures. Tax incentives need to effectively influence taxpayer behavior to be successful. These credits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and may not be necessary for well-informed consumers, potentially leading to windfall gains. Administrative issues have also been identified by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has found administrative issues with current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency. The goal of residential energy-efficiency tax credits is to encourage additional investments, but there are concerns that these credits may not lead to increased investment as intended. In 1979, Members of Congress expressed reservations about residential energy tax credits, questioning their effectiveness in incentivizing investment in energy-efficiency property. Representative Bill Frenzel noted that the tax credits did not seem to motivate economic action and were not an efficient stimulus. Empirical evidence on the impact of these tax credits on investment in energy-efficiency property is mixed. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in incentivizing investment in energy-efficiency property is questioned by policymakers. Some argue that the tax credits lead to additional investment, while others believe they result in windfall gains for credit recipients. Factors such as other market incentives, delayed savings realization, and reduced incentive power of the credit are reasons why tax credits may not significantly impact purchasing decisions for consumers. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, mainly higher-income individuals. These credits may encourage investment in energy-efficient equipment, especially for those already in the market. However, they do not provide a financial incentive for taxpayers without tax liability. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency target higher-income homeowners, with over three-quarters of claims made by those with incomes above $50,000 in 2015. These credits aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties among individuals who make energy property investments. Tax units with incomes below $50,000 make up 61.4% of all tax units, but only 22.4% claim residential energy tax credits, totaling 11.0% of the credit value. As income rises, the average credit amount also increases, with the highest income tax units receiving seven times more than the lowest income units. Nonrefundable tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D may limit who can claim them, as the credit value cannot exceed tax liability. Taxpayers without enough tax liability cannot fully benefit from the Section 25C credit, while those who eliminate tax liability through other incentives cannot benefit from certain residential tax credits. Residential energy-efficiency tax incentives are limited to higher-income taxpayers, which may undermine the policy rationale behind using tax credits to motivate energy-efficiency investments. Tax credits that reduce upfront costs might encourage investment, but if only available to higher-income households, they may not effectively address market barriers. A simple tax code with low compliance costs is more likely to encourage taxpayers to claim benefits. Burdensome filing processes could deter eligible taxpayers from claiming incentives. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found opportunities for fraud in residential energy tax credits due to lack of verification by the IRS. Taxpayers claiming these credits were not required to provide proof of qualifying energy modifications or residency, leading to potential eligibility issues. The TIGTA found that IRS Form 5695 did not verify eligibility for residential energy tax credits, leading to potential fraud. Updates were made in 2011 to request more information about the taxpayer's home. Errors in applying credit limits resulted in eligible taxpayers being denied credits. The 25C credit is limited to $500, while the 25D credit has no limit but cannot exceed tax liability. These credits are temporary provisions available to Congress. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits are temporary provisions available to Congress. One policy option is to allow these credits to expire as scheduled, potentially affecting taxpayers' purchasing decisions. Congress may consider modifying or replacing the credits with a grant program. Policymakers have the option to extend, expand, or modify residential energy-efficiency tax incentives. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, introduced in 2005, have undergone changes. Extending the credit with the $500-per-taxpayer cap may not provide enough incentives for homeowners who have already claimed credits. Options for expansion include using a more generous formula, expanding eligible technologies, and removing caps. These expansions could encourage more purchases and provide windfalls to taxpayers. Policymakers could also scale back provisions by reinstating technology-specific caps or introducing an overall cap. Policymakers may consider changes to the current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, such as introducing an overall cap for the Section 25D credit and reducing technology-specific caps. They could also phase out credits for upper-income taxpayers and replace them with a rebate program or alternative mechanism to provide direct cash payments to consumers for eligible purchases. This could be a more beneficial way to incentivize purchases of energy-efficient or renewable-energy-generating technologies, especially for consumers with limited funds. In 2010, legislation was introduced to create a rebate program for eligible energy-efficient property installations. The Home Star Energy Retrofit Act aimed to provide rebates to contractors, but it was not passed by the Senate. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency have a history dating back to the late 1970s, with present-day incentives introduced in 2005. Tax incentives introduced in 2005 are similar to earlier incentives from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable energy generation, with components for energy conservation expenditures and qualified expenditures for solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 increased the credit amount for renewable energy generation. The credit expired in 1985 and was not reinstated until 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) created new tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to claim a 10% credit on qualified expenditures for specific types of property, with limits on the amount that could be claimed. The maximum credit for windows was $200, and the lifetime cap was $500 for 2006 and 2007. The Section 25C credit for residential energy efficiency had a lifetime cap of $500 for 2006 and 2007. Another credit, Section 25D, provided a 30% credit on expenditures for photovoltaic, solar water-heating, and fuel-cell properties, with annual limits. The credits expired at the end of 2007, except for Section 25D which was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 clarified that all property using solar energy for electricity generation could qualify for the Section 25D credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit, expanding the list of qualified energy property. Geothermal heat pumps were removed from Section 25C but added to Section 25D, with the credit extended through 2016 and expanded to include new technologies like small wind-energy property. The Section 25D tax credit allowed for a 30% credit on expenditures for small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump properties, with caps on the amount eligible for each technology. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified the tax credits, increasing the credit cap and expanding eligibility for energy-efficiency improvements. The $200 aggregate cap for windows was removed for 2009 and 2010, allowing taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows. The efficiency standards for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property were reduced under ARRA, expanding the credit availability. Changes to the Section 25D tax credit removed maximum credit caps for most technologies. These changes were effective from 2009 through 2016, leading to an increase in the number and amount of credits claimed. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, reinstating the general lifetime limit and window lifetime limit. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the 2011 parameters of the Section 25C credit for two additional years. Additionally, certain efficiency standards and technology-specific credit limits were restored to pre-ARRA levels. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended the Section 25C credit for one additional year in 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended and modified the 25C credit for two years in 2015 and 2016, with more stringent Energy Star requirements for windows and doors. Division P of PATH Act extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021. The 25D credit for solar technologies will be extended from 2017 to 2021, with the credit rate decreasing from 30% to 22% over the years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, with credit rates matching those of solar technologies. The 25D credit for solar technologies will be extended from 2017 to 2021, with the credit rate decreasing to 22% in 2021, matching the credit rates for solar technologies."
