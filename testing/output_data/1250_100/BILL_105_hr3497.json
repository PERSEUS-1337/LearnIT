    "content": "The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 1998\" establishes Individual Investment Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 1998\" allows individuals to deduct cash contributions made to individual investment accounts established for their benefit. An individual investment account is a trust created in the U.S. for the exclusive benefit of an individual, with specific requirements for contributions, trustee qualifications, and asset investments. The Individual Investment Account Act of 1998 prohibits trust assets from being invested in collectibles and requires assets to be kept separate except in common trust funds. Contributions are deemed made on the last day of the taxable year, and distributions are generally included in gross income unless part of a qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution. The term 'qualified 1st-time homebuyer distribution' refers to a payment received by a first-time homebuyer from an individual investment account to be used for qualified acquisition costs for a principal residence. The total amount of such distributions for all taxable years cannot exceed $20,000, and the basis of the home is reduced by the distribution amount. Transfer of an individual's interest in an investment account to a former spouse under a divorce decree is not taxable. The account will be treated as belonging to the spouse, exempt from taxation unless it no longer qualifies as an individual investment account. If an individual engages in a prohibited transaction with their individual investment account, it will lose its exemption and be treated as distributing all its assets. Additionally, pledging the account as security can have consequences. During a taxable year, if an individual uses their individual investment account as security for a loan, that portion is treated as distributed to them. Rollover contributions are allowed if the amount is paid into another account within 60 days. Cost-of-living adjustments increase the $20,000 limit in subsequent years.

Rollover contributions are allowed if the amount is paid into another account within 60 days. Cost-of-living adjustments increase the $20,000 limit in subsequent years. Additionally, custodial accounts are treated as trusts if held by a bank or another entity meeting specific criteria. The custodian of such accounts is considered the trustee. The trustee of an individual investment account must report to the Secretary and the account holder on contributions, distributions, and other matters as required. Contributions to individual investment accounts are deductible from adjusted gross income. Individual investment accounts are exempt from estate tax. \"Individual investment accounts are deductible from adjusted gross income and exempt from estate tax.\" Individual investment accounts, as defined in section 222(b), are excluded from the gross estate value and exempt from estate tax. A special rule exempts individuals from tax on prohibited transactions concerning such accounts if they cease to be individual investment accounts. In section 222(b), individual investment accounts are excluded from the gross estate value and exempt from estate tax. Amendments include failure to provide reports on individual investment accounts and adjustment of basis for residences acquired through these accounts. The table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by striking the item relating to section 222 and inserting a new item. The table of sections for part III of subchapter A of chapter 11 of the Code is amended by adding new items for individual investment accounts and disclaimers. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997."
