    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services and programs for individuals aged 60 and older. Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Funding for different titles comes from either HHS or the Department of Labor. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times since its inception. The Older Americans Act (OAA) has been reauthorized and amended multiple times since its enactment in 1965. The last reauthorization in 2006 extended authorizations of appropriations through FY2011. Despite the expiration of these authorizations, Congress has continued to fund OAA programs. A report discusses FY2015 funding, legislative activity, and funding decisions for selected programs. Appendixes provide detailed funding information and history. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding, with 70.7% allocated to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to other OAA programs. In FY2015, OAA programs received $1.878 billion in funding, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest share of funding at 70.7%, with allocations for nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of funding, while the rest went to other OAA programs. Additionally, there were specific increases in funding for Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities under Title IV in FY2015. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs fluctuated between FY2006 and FY2015, with a decline in FY2011 through FY2013 due to sequestration. In FY2015, OAA programs received $1.878 billion in funding, with Title III programs receiving the largest share for nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion. In FY2015, funding for OAA Title II \"Program Administration\" reflected costs for aging and disability services programs administered by ACL, not just aging services programs administered by AOA. Discretionary funding for most federal government agencies, including OAA programs, was provided through three continuing resolutions (CRs) prior to P.L. 113-235. These CRs generally funded discretionary Labor-HHS-Education programs at the same rate as in the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, with a 0.0554% reduction. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for a FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. The ranking Member introduced H.R. 5464, which would have provided funding for OAA programs, including a $13.9 million increase for OAA Title V and $1.6 million increase for senior nutrition programs. The bill did not specify funding for other OAA programs and activities. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill with funding for OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels. The FY2015 budget proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with most programs funded at FY2014 levels. Exceptions included new funding for ADRCs, CSEOA Program, Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and White House Conference on Aging. President Obama's budget requested a $52.5 million decrease from FY2014 funding levels. The FY2015 budget proposed new discretionary funding for the White House Conference on Aging and an \"Elder Justice Initiative.\" It also included transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. Differences in funding for selected OAA programs and issues were highlighted among various budget proposals. The CSEOA program, also known as the Senior Community Service Employment Program, aims to provide part-time community service opportunities for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring administration of the program from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% compared to FY2014. The transfer was intended to align CSEOA with other aging services programs and streamline operations under one department. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL to better target funds and streamline operations. ACL suggested restructuring CSEOA as a community service program to focus on those with the greatest need and consider all sources of income for eligibility. The Senate bill recommended funding CSEOA at the FY2014 level, while the subcommittee suggested keeping the program in DOL. The subcommittee recommended keeping CSEOA in DOL with funding at $448.3 million for FY2015, same as FY2014. P.L. 113-235 allowed 0.5% of funds for program evaluation. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the US, with 25% in poverty. President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, but Senate bill did not fund it due to budget constraints. The draft report urged ACL to prioritize Holocaust survivors within existing programs. H.R. 5464 did not specify funding for this population. FY2015 final funding included $2.5 million for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) offer information on long-term services and supports, counseling, access to public programs, discharge planning, and care transition services. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide. ADRCs had 5.2 million client contacts and received $10 million in mandatory funding from FY2010 to FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding but $20 million annually for five years in renewed mandatory funding. AOA and CMS provided $100 million since 2003 for ADRC infrastructure. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged better coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs. The White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused on concerns of older individuals and provided guidance to policymakers. The President's FY2015 budget requested $3.0 million for a conference, but the Senate bill did not allocate funding due to budget constraints. The draft report suggested using existing resources from HHS and the White House to support the conference. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 will not have dedicated funding specified in H.R. 5464 or final FY2015 appropriations. The conference aims to use technology to engage more people and will focus on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held to gather input for the conference. More information can be found at http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov. Appendix A and B provide details on the authorizations of appropriations and funding history for Older Americans Act programs from FY2006 to FY2015. Amounts are not adjusted for inflation, and specific programs within larger budget accounts are highlighted. More information can be found at http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov."
