Additionally, authorization is granted for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) as described in section 10A of the Act. \"Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) is authorized under section 10A of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002, with $50,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2007.\" The Director is authorized to award grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory science access at the secondary school level. Grants are awarded based on merit and eligibility criteria include partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. High-need local educational agencies can receive grants under this section for activities described in their application for up to 3 fiscal years. To be eligible, agencies must submit a plan outlining how they will carry out the program, developed in consultation with various experts in laboratory science and classroom instruction. The Federal share of the cost for activities under the grant shall not exceed 33 percent. The proposed laboratory improvements and instrumentation must align with State mathematics and science academic standards. They should be part of a comprehensive program to enhance the quality of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction. This includes designing clear learning outcomes, sequencing experiences to complement classroom instruction, integrating science learning with content, and incorporating student reflection and discussion. Additionally, professional development and training activities for teachers and school personnel must be described. The curr_chunk describes requirements for laboratory facilities funded under grants, including safety assurances, maintenance plans, and assessment methods. Grants must supplement existing programs and improve secondary science education through expertise collaboration. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing science education at the secondary school level through improving laboratories and providing instrumentation. This includes developing a plan for laboratory improvement, purchasing equipment, maintaining facilities, training teachers, and developing curricula. The curr_chunk focuses on developing curricula, training in laboratory safety, implementing hands-on experiences, creating evaluation tools, and other activities to enhance science education at the secondary school level. The curr_chunk discusses the application process for grants under a high-need local educational agency, including the description of partnerships, implementation roles, activity alignment with academic standards, and the plan for utilizing grant funds. The curr_chunk outlines activities to promote student achievement in mathematics and science, based on research and best practices. It also includes activities to encourage interest in STEM fields among underrepresented individuals. The curr_chunk describes the evaluation criteria for applications submitted for promoting student achievement in mathematics and science. It includes assessing the partnership's ability to effectively carry out programs, alignment with academic standards, and the use of relevant research and best practices to increase student achievement. The evaluation criteria for applications promoting student achievement in mathematics and science include assessing the partnership's ability to implement activities for larger reform efforts, encouraging interest in STEM fields, and preparing individuals for postsecondary studies. The Director will evaluate the program using common benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and materials developed by the partnerships. The Director will compare the effectiveness of practices and materials developed by partnerships authorized under this section with those funded by other agencies. Results of the evaluation will be made public and provided to relevant Congressional committees. Materials proven effective will be widely disseminated to the public. Technical assistance and coordination will be provided as needed. The Director will provide technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies for grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be held for grant recipients to promote collaboration. A report on coordination will be submitted to relevant Congressional committees. The annual report will describe how the program will be coordinated with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Definitions include 'high-need local educational agency' and 'National Laboratory'."
