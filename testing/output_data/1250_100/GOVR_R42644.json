    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 million for DHS, excluding funds for overseas operations and disaster relief. The Senate-reported bill provided slightly less funding than the Administration's request for DHS in FY2013. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as a continuing resolution through March 27, 2013. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 113-6, provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security. After across-the-board cuts, $38.348 billion was available for DHS to use. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, P.L. 113-6, allocated $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security, with $38.348 billion available after across-the-board cuts. Funding details were sourced from various congressional reports, budget documents, and post-sequestration operating plans. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) transferred functions, funding, and personnel of 22 agencies to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, covering various offices and agencies such as Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, with additional titles sometimes added for special issues in the annual appropriations bills. The maximum budget authority is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(b) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each bill, with any total above the ceiling subject to a point of order. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year as bills progress towards final enactment. The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first affected by the Budget Control Act, which established spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established nonsecurity spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security spending. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud and abuse. The levels set by the BCA became the basis for enforcement in the Senate and the House. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security spending. The BCA required a deficit reduction plan to be enacted by January 15, 2012, triggering automatic spending cuts when not met. The sequestration process involved across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made significant changes on January 2, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made significant changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) procedures in FY2013. The joint committee sequester date was delayed to March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the dollar amount. President Obama ordered the sequester implementation, with sequestration applied at the program, project, and activity level. The post-sequestration numbers are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan. The report only focuses on resources provided through P.L. 113-6, not P.L. 113-2. Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to align budget authority with spending limits. DHS faces a 0.1% across-the-board cut in the \"security\" category to meet spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget determines if limits are exceeded. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes two separate across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to avoid exceeding spending limits. OMB calculated additional rescissions needed for DHS and other agencies. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are not subject to these cuts. Tables in the report show DHS's initial allocations for FY2013. DHS's appropriations process for FY2013 involved adjustments based on three justifications outlined in the BCA: emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. OMB determined a $11,779 million allowable adjustment for disaster relief, fully exercised with $6,400 million from pre-sequestration resources through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. The FY2013 DHS appropriations process involved adjustments based on three justifications outlined in the BCA. OMB determined a $11,779 million allowable adjustment for disaster relief, fully exercised with $6,400 million from pre-sequestration resources through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. The final DHS appropriations legislation included in Division D of P.L. 113-6 prior to sequestration impact. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for all civilian federal employees, which was rejected by the House, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither the part-year continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provided resources for it. The DHS bill's budget breakdown lacks transparency, with varying budgets for different components. Table 4 and Figure 1 display DHS's FY 2013 discretionary budget authority by component. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations, while Table 4 shows raw numbers. General provisions in the bill include rescissions of prior-year budget authority, impacting net budget authority. The left column in Figure 1 shows discretionary budget authority in P.L. 113-6, while the right column includes adjustments under the BCA. The DHS budget includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations, with funding not solely from discretionary appropriations. Components like TSA and CIS rely on fee income for a significant portion of their budget. Figure 2 compares the Administration's FY2013 budget request with enacted budget, showing discretionary and mandatory appropriations, as well as non-appropriated resources available to DHS. The DHS budget includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations, with funding not solely from discretionary appropriations. Components like TSA and CIS rely on fee income for a significant portion of their budget. The graphic reflecting FY2013 enacted funding includes funding provided through P.L. 113-2, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations, as enacted, for FY2003 through FY2013, with amounts not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The House Appropriations Committee's full committee markup of H.R. 5855 on May 16, 2012, was the second earliest in the history of the DHS appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee's markup of H.R. 5855 on May 16, 2012, was the second earliest in DHS appropriations history. The Senate marked up S. 3216 on May 22, 2012, the earliest ever. P.L. 113-6 was the second-latest enactment of annual appropriations for DHS. Title I of the bill funds management activities, A&O, and OIG. The Administration requested $1,279 million for FY2013, with the House bill proposing $1,020 million and the Senate bill $1,102 million. After cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $1,086 million for Title I. The enacted amount for Title I in FY2013 was $1,086 million, a decrease from the requested level and below the FY2012 amount. Sequestration further reduced this to $1,026 million, impacting various components within the Department of Homeland Security. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses, including various offices reporting directly to the Secretary. The Administration has requested funding for the consolidation of its headquarters, including the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). A graphic provides a representation of the discretionary appropriation provided to each element of DHS, showing the FY2013 request compared to the FY2012 enacted appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. The total request for departmental management activities in Title I for FY2012 was $724 million. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items for three offices. Program changes included funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. The Administration also requested $222 million for the USM with several program changes proposed. The Administration requested funding for various offices including OCHCO, OCFO, and OCIO for salaries, expenses, and IT improvements. Specifically, $55 million was requested for OCFO for Financial Systems Modernization, and $313 million for OCIO for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including data center migration for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The House Appropriations committee recommended reduced funding for management activities under Title I compared to the President's request. The reductions were justified by the committee due to the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. During floor consideration of appropriations bills on June 6, 2013, several amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management by almost $33 million. The largest amendments included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and reallocating them to various agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. During floor consideration of appropriations bills on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management by almost $33 million. The amendments included reallocating funds from the Office of the Under Secretary for Management to agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Additionally, amendments were made to increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million, leaving the USM with an appropriation of $180 million, $41 million less than requested. Representative Flake proposed reallocating funds from official reception and representation expenses to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000, which was agreed upon by a voice vote. Provisions were also made to withhold $71 million from obligation until all required reports for the FY2014 budget request were received, and a general provision proposed to restrict the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by the Secretary of DHS. The House Appropriations Committee proposed withholding funds and restricting the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by key officials until required reports were submitted. Additionally, funding for the Office of General Counsel and OCPO was recommended to be reduced for non-compliance with statutory requirements. Over $124 million would be withheld until all necessary reports for the FY2014 budget request were received. The House Appropriations Committee recommended allocating $242 million for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment. They also allocated $27 million for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities. The committee supported the migration of resources to the Department's data centers but did not provide the proposed $65 million due to budget shortfalls mentioned in the President's request. The report emphasized direct communication from relevant components on their areas of responsibility. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended appropriations for various departments, with decreases compared to the President's budget request. The total funding for departmental management would have been $655 million, a decrease of 9.5% from the President's request. The Senate committee report highlighted a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, although the recommended budget was still down from FY2012 levels. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended decreased appropriations for departmental management, with OCRCL funding down by $1 million from FY2012 levels. The committee report noted reductions in funding for reception and representation expenses and encouraged filling the historian position. The committee emphasized the need for robust oversight of major acquisitions and security measures to safeguard DHS personnel and facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended appropriations for the Department's critical operational missions, including $35 million for OCHCO and $248 million for OCIO. The funding for OCIO would include $121 million for salaries and expenses, $127 million for technology investments, and $65 million for data center migration. The committee report highlighted the expected savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030 from data center consolidation. The appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO were slightly less than the President's request. The Department of Homeland Security's departmental management funding in Title I is $643 million, a decrease of $170 million or 21% from the President's request. Only OCIO experienced a funding reduction due to sequestration. P.L. 113-6 directed the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT projects funded under the CIO or through reimbursable agreements. The Senate's explanatory statement directs the Secretary to provide reports on travel costs, submit a contingency plan for user fee collections, and submit acquisition status reports. DHS is required to report on workforce strategy implementation and justify any insourcing or outsourcing initiatives in the President's annual budget request. The CFO will provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts and funding levels for management accounts. The budget reflects spending cuts from FY2012 enacted amounts but does not include the impact of sequestration. The DHS Plan column shows budgetary resources after sequestration, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact. Issues identified by House and Senate Appropriations committees include new revenue assumptions, late submissions of required plans, and conference spending. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices\u2014the Office of International Affairs (OIA), the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (SLLE), and the Private Sector Office (PSO)\u2014currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have these offices report directly to the OSEM was rejected during the legislative process. The House committee recommended establishing an external affairs office to consolidate and streamline functions of various existing offices. The Senate committee report questioned the need for standalone offices within DHS and suggested that functions could be performed adequately within the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget included proposals to increase budgetary resources through aviation security fees, customs fee revenues, and reimbursement agreements with outside parties. The House rejected these proposals, while the Senate included them. The House committee expressed concerns about the budget assumptions and potential shortfalls in revenue. The Committee rejects unrealistic budgeting approaches and emphasizes the need for transparency in budget proposals. It withholds funding due to late submission of required plans and reports. P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into reimbursable agreements for customs services. The House committee expresses concerns about revenue provisions and funding allocation. The Department has been late in responding to Congressional direction and failing to submit required reports on time, leading to a withholding of funding. The Committee emphasizes the importance of investment and expenditure plans for oversight work, criticizing the Department for late, incomplete, or missing submissions. Compliance with statutory requirements is expected. The Committee expects the Department to comply with statutory requirements for reports and plans, noting that many are over three months late. The Senate proposed withholding 59% of budgets until reports are submitted on time, while the House reduced the USM budget by 70%. P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of budgets until all reports are submitted. The House committee emphasizes oversight of expenditures in the current fiscal climate. The House and Senate bills include provisions for oversight of department spending on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. Quarterly reports to the DHS OIG on events costing over $20,000 are required, with restrictions on using grants or contracts for unrelated conferences. Compliance with OMB Memorandum M-12-12 is mandated, as per Section 3003 of Division G of P.L. 113-6. The House and Senate bills mandate oversight of department spending on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. Section 3003 of Division G of P.L. 113-6 requires government-wide reporting on conference costs, with limits on overseas conference attendance. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the DC area. The Department of Homeland Security is consolidating its headquarters spread across 22 federal agencies in the National Capital region to improve efficiency. A $3.4 billion master plan with the General Services Administration will create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. $1.4 billion will be funded through DHS budget and $2 billion through GSA. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far, with Phase 1A nearing completion for a new Coast Guard headquarters facility. Not all DHS functions in the DC area will move to the new facility. The Administration has requested $89 million for activities related to the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, including funding for a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. Additionally, $24.5 million was requested for moving the Coast Guard into its new facility in FY2013. No other funding requests for the DHS consolidated headquarters project were included in the budget submission to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or any part of the St. Elizabeths project through the management accounts. The bill would have provided the Administration's requested funding for the Coast Guard to move to the new facility, with an additional $10 million through the Coast Guard's construction budget for project support. The Committee recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, with funding included in the Coast Guard appropriation for the move to St. Elizabeths. Additional funding under Coast Guard construction was allocated for project completion, site access improvement, and planning adjustments. The Committee supports the Department's efforts to creatively modify or consolidate leases due to delays in constructing a permanent headquarters. $10 million is allocated for Phase 1 of construction to ensure the Coast Guard can move in 2013. The Committee encourages progress updates within 90 days and includes funding for site access improvements. The new DHS headquarters project has faced delays and cost increases, with funding only allocated for the Coast Guard relocation in 2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for necessary road and interchange improvements, but no funding was provided for Phase 2 construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for necessary road and interchange improvements for the DHS headquarters project. The funding remained in the reported version of the legislation, with requirements for expenditure plans and quarterly briefings on consolidation activities. An updated plan is being developed to complete the headquarters consolidation project in smaller, more manageable segments. The Department is working on an updated plan to complete the headquarters consolidation project in smaller, more manageable segments. $29 million is allocated for necessary expenses related to the project, with no reduction through sequestration. Funds from the Analysis and Operations account support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning. The Analysis and Operations account within the Department of Homeland Security manages intelligence information sharing and operations coordination. The FY2013 budget request was $322 million, with a decrease of $16 million from the previous year. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a further decrease of $21 million from the FY2012 level. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying proposed increases in executive service salaries and funding for certain elements, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease from the previous year. The Senate also required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013. The House Committee on Appropriations rejected increases in executive service salaries and funding for certain elements. The Senate recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, with a requirement for an expenditure plan for FY2013. P.L. 113-6 allocated $322 million for the account, the same as the President's request and 4.7% lower than FY2012. Sequestration reduced the budget to $306 million, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about I&A's mission focus. Representative Myrick highlighted the need for clarity in DHS's intelligence mission during a House committee hearing. The Aspen Institute report recommended that DHS focus on specific areas where it has unique strengths and value, rather than duplicating efforts of other agencies. Emphasis should be placed on serving state and local partners, addressing gaps in intelligence coverage. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. They requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds for disaster preparedness. The DHS Office of the Inspector General requested $144 million in funding for audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. The House-passed bill included $109 million for the DHS OIG, with a $10 million reduction due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million coming from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. The Senate committee report allocated $121 million in net budget authority for the DHS Office of the Inspector General for FY2013, with an additional $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE. The funding also aimed to complete audits mandated under P.L. 110-53 and grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative grants by August 20, 2014. Sequestration reduced OIG budget authority by $7 million according to the DHS FY2013 expenditure plan. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a decrease in resources for the OIG by roughly $7 million. The plan required the OIG to conduct various reviews and provide reports to the Appropriations Committees on topics such as budget expenditures, integrity of CBP and ICE officers, non-competitive contracts, and operations of local law enforcement. Additionally, the House directed the OIG to report on compliance with federal laws, conduct TSA screening inspections, assess fraud detection reforms, and review delays in FEMA's public assistance programs. The Senate did not include these provisions in their allocation for the OIG. The Senate did not include provisions for FEMA's public assistance programs in their allocation for the OIG. However, they directed the OIG to review FEMA's application of its rules for awarding public assistance funds for debris removal. The Senate expressed concerns about the OIG's independence and ability to report results in a timely manner. No additional funding was allocated for these new tasks. The statement directs GAO to review the organizational structure of the OIG, how it reports audit results, and if reporting functions comply with independence standards. The OIG has many senior positions filled by acting officials, potentially hindering its duties. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The requested budget for FY2013 was $30,759 million, with the House bill proposing $30,946 million and the Senate bill proposing $30,974 million. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 provided $31,267 million for Title II, which was reduced to $30,184 million after sequestration. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, inspecting people and goods to prevent terrorism. CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents enforce laws and regulations at the border to prevent illegal entries. CBP's programs include Border Security Inspections, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Funding for CBP reflects spending cuts relative to FY2012 enacted amounts, but does not include additional cuts required by sequestration. The \"DHS Plan\" column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million (1.9%) over the enacted FY2012 level of $10,155 million. The total request included $1,626 million in fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds, for a gross budget request of $11,971 million, which is a $320 million (2.8%) increase from the enacted FY2012 level of $11,651 million. Program changes from FY2012 included transferring the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program from NPPD to CBP with a $261.5 million increase, and increases for the Automated Targeting System (ATS) and Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million for CBP for FY2013, with increases for various security-related programs such as the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, National Targeting Center, Container Security Initiative, and intellectual property rights enforcement. There were also decreases in funding for Office of Air and Marine Interdictions, management and administration staffing, and fleet acquisition and management. The House approved $10,172 in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with decreases in various areas such as fleet acquisition, information technology, nonintrusive inspection operations, officer overtime expenses, training expenses, and transportation program. This represents an increase of $17 million from last year's appropriation and a decrease of $173 million from the President's request. The House-passed bill allocated $11,689 in gross budget authority for CBP, with amendments including funding for staffing model completion and communications infrastructure. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million from last year's appropriation. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with a decrease from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by roughly an additional $575 million. Various policy issues related to CBP were discussed during the FY2013 appropriations cycle. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 mandated the implementation of an automated entry and exit data system by the former INS to track foreign visitors' arrival and departure. This system collects biographic and biometric information to verify their identity and is shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. The entry-exit system has been operational at most U.S. ports of entry since December 2006. The entry-exit system implemented in January 2009 requires most non-citizens entering the US to provide biometric data, but does not collect data from those exiting. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. The enhanced biographic exit program checks passenger manifest data against immigration, criminal, and national security databases to identify overstays and high-priority individuals for follow-up investigations. The Canadian immigration agency shares biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada with DHS, treating them as U.S. exit records. Congress has urged DHS to implement a biometric exit system. The entry-exit system's organizational structure has changed over the years, initially under US-VISIT Program and later proposed under a Screening Coordination Office that was never funded. Funding for the SCO was never appropriated, and US-VISIT became a stand-alone office within DHS in FY2006. In FY2008, US-VISIT was transferred to NPPD. The FY2013 budget proposed to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies. Congress did not fully support the proposed move, with the House bill transferring $73 million to CBP and ICE, and the Senate bill recommending US-VISIT be transferred as a stand-alone appropriation within CBP. US-VISIT Program was replaced entirely under P.L. 113-6. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) under P.L. 113-6. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the staffing levels but raised questions about how DHS sets them. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if DHS preserves high staffing levels during budget tightening. The House report encouraged CBP to consider changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, and technology utilization. The House and Senate reports requested more specific staffing and deployment plans for border patrol agents and OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry. CBP officer salaries are partially funded by user fees, and efforts are being made to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues. Border patrol staffing has increased significantly since FY2005, while OFO staffing at POEs has not increased as much despite expanded responsibilities. Some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to illegal migrants and drug smugglers entering through POEs. Increased OFO staffing is seen as crucial for enhancing security and facilitating legal admissions. With the implementation of sequestration on March 1, 2013, DHS officials warned of potential furloughs and reduced hiring for CBP personnel. Measures to minimize the impact include eliminating performance awards, reducing contracts, and relying on overtime reductions and hiring freezes to avoid employee furloughs. Over 90% of the Border Security and Control budget goes to salaries and benefits. With over 90% of the Border Security and Control budget going to salaries and benefits, CBP frontline staffing may face reduced overtime hours and furlough days. The administration is considering public-private partnerships to enhance services at ports of entry, despite restrictions on CBP providing services on a fee-for-service basis. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five public-private partnerships in FY2013 for additional services at POEs and new facilities. CBP collects various user fees, including COBRA fees, to fund customs services. These fees reimburse CBP for customs functions and are deposited in the Customs User Fee Account. Congressional interest has been drawn to the collection of COBRA passenger fees without corresponding appropriations. Section 521 of the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and Section 601 of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 increased fees for passengers entering the US, resulting in significant revenue collection. The funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not been obligated for customs revenue collection yet. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the appropriation of these funds. Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the disposition of fees collected for customs revenue collection. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on access to funds identified by GAO and how to eliminate them from the department's books. P.L. 113-6 appropriates $110 million to address a budget shortfall in CBP salaries and directs CBP and OMB to include a means of accessing COBRA fees in future budget requests. DHS uses technology to monitor the Southwest Border for illegal entries. Previous surveillance initiatives have faced criticism for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, focusing on rapid deployment of existing technology. The House and Senate expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new border surveillance plan, criticizing CBP for delays in procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment. Both chambers recommended fully funding the President's request for the border surveillance mission but also called for rescinding unobligated balances from the account. P.L. 113-6 includes $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP also uses manned and unmanned aircraft for surveillance. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance activities. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as of November 2012, with some Members of Congress supporting their use for border surveillance. However, concerns exist about privacy and cost effectiveness, with a DHS Inspector General report criticizing CBP's UAS program. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance activities. Both appropriations committees recommended increases to the OAM budget over the President's request, with the House recommending an increase of $82,700,000 and the Senate recommending an increase of $70,997,000. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, directing CBP to restore overall and UAS flight hours to 2011 levels. Cargo bound for the United States is scanned for radiation and inspected before being loaded onto ships. The 100% scanning requirement established by the 9/11 Act has raised concerns about balancing security benefits with costs, such as increased paperwork and longer wait times for importers. Some suggest focusing scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make better use of resources. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to the Automated Targeting System for security screening. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported these programs, acknowledging concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations. ICE is responsible for locating and removing aliens who have overstayed visas or entered illegally. They also combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws. The FY2013 budget requested $5,332 million for ICE, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 (3.7%) from the FY2012 enacted amount. The budget request included various changes such as increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program function to ICE. Reductions were made for programs like 287(g), Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $5,474 million in net budget authority for FY2013. ICE's funding for FY2013 saw variations in different proposals. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total funding authority of $5,786 million, a decrease of $77 million (1.3%) from the FY2012 enacted level. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5,330 million in net budget authority, a decrease of $2 million (less than 0.1%) from the Administration's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from the previous year. ICE's FY2013 budget saw a decrease in funding compared to the previous year, with a total of $5,738 million in gross budget authority. Sequestration further reduced the budget by $200 million. The agency's allocation of resources for its various activities, including detaining and removing aliens, has been a topic of debate in Congress. ICE's mission includes locating and removing deportable aliens, with a capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year. There are an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million aliens who have committed a crime in the US. Legislation directs ICE to prioritize the removal of aliens convicted of a crime based on severity. The Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Concerns exist about insufficient detention space, leading to decisions on releasing aliens based on space availability rather than individual cases. Some advocate for alternatives to detention for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and proportional treatment option. ICE's detention bed spaces have been a contentious issue, with a reduction in bed space requested in the FY2013 budget. In 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees due to operating under a continuing resolution. ICE released detainees in 2013 due to operating under a continuing resolution and upcoming sequestration reductions. Critics viewed the release as political pressure on Congress. ICE is required to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013, leading to interest in alternatives to detention like electronic monitoring and home visits for non-detained aliens with final removal orders. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an increase in funding for the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed amounts and increased ATD funding by $20 million. Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD funding by $19 million. ICE requested resources to expand Secure Communities nationwide by the end of FY2013. ICE has the resources to identify more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. There is debate about the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease from the previous year. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. Senate-reported S. 3216 and H.R. 5855 had different funding levels for the 287(g) program. P.L. 113-6 funds the program at $68 million. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about agency operations and policies. The Public Advocate Office was created in response to critiques of ICE's unresponsiveness to complaints. Some argue it is not productive and a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. It was transferred to DHS in 2002 and is tasked with safeguarding against terrorist threats through various security measures. The TSA is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US, including seaports, by issuing regulations and enforcing security measures. The TSA budget is complex, with various sources of funding such as airline security fees and transportation threat assessment fees. The President's request included a gross budget authority of $7,645 million for TSA, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections. The TSA's budget for FY2012 included a gross budget authority of $7,645 million, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represented a 2.5% decrease in gross funding but a 7.1% drop in net appropriations compared to the previous year. The request allocated $5,099 million for aviation security, a decrease of $155 million (3.0%) from FY2012. Funding for Surface Transportation Security was proposed at $124 million, a decrease of $10 million (7.8%) from the previous year. Requested decreases in funding were due to planned reductions in procurement, maintenance costs, and program reductions, as well as improvements in management efficiencies. The requested funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing (TTAC) would increase by $68 million (33%) to $272 million, including $30 million for infrastructure modernization. Funding for Transportation Security Support would be set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%), and the Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS) would receive $930 million, a decrease of $36 million (3.8%). The House-passed bill specified a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million for TSA, representing a $147 million (1.9%) decrease from the administration's request. The House-passed bill for aviation security included a 0.6% drop in net appropriations from the request. It specified $5,041 million in gross budget authority, $57 million less than requested. Despite rejecting proposed increases in passenger security fees, appropriations for aviation security rose $58 million above the request. The bill also recommended cuts to screening operations and specified funding for surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS, all below the requested amounts. The House committee noted reductions to the TSA budget request to offset a shortfall from proposed passenger security fee increases. The Senate-reported bill included a $11 million decrease in gross funding and a $211 million reduction in net appropriations compared to the Administration's request. This included cuts to checkpoint equipment and explosives detection systems procurement. The bill also incorporated the full $315 million in revenue projections from passenger security fees, leading to a 7.3% drop in aviation security funding from the Administration's request. The Appropriations Committee report cited unobligated prior-year balances as the reason for reductions in explosives detection systems procurement and screener staffing. The FFDO program received $24 million, $12 million above the request. Sequestration and P.L. 113-6 reduced TSA budget authority by $629 million compared to FY2012 levels. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for TSA to be $7,212 million. The Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights. This change was estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. Airlines have raised concerns about the impact of fee increases on passenger air travel. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip, with all fees going towards aviation security. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional issues. Ultimately, the passenger security fees remained unchanged under P.L. 113-6. TSA identified over $100 million in savings through improved management efficiencies compared to FY2012, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. Questions were raised about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner and how FY2013 efficiency goals will be met. Efficiency improvements are seen as crucial in addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA, which has implemented risk-based screening initiatives like PreCheck and modified screening procedures for children and flight crew members. Trial programs are being conducted for screening children, elderly passengers, and flight crew members using modified procedures to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings. The PreCheck program, modeled after trusted traveler programs like Global Entry, is being expanded by TSA to increase screening efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. The House and Senate committees support TSA's plans to expand the PreCheck program. The Senate committee directed TSA to report on its plans to expand the PreCheck program, including statistics on eligible population growth, passenger satisfaction, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for low-risk verification. Concern was raised about the limited scope of the known crew member pilot program, with a call to include flight attendants. While TSA's risk-based screening pilot programs were praised, behavioral-based observation and screening faced scrutiny. The House committee did not support increasing Behavior Detection Officers, citing a lack of clear evidence for their effectiveness. A formal cost-benefit analysis and robust risk-based strategy for BDO deployment were recommended. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at FY2012 levels and passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The TSA was directed to revisit the use of FFDOs and other federal law enforcement assets on commercial flights. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs, disagreeing with the request to reduce funding. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime homeland security, was transferred to DHS in 2003 and also performs non-security missions like search and rescue and environmental protection. The Coast Guard was transferred to the DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million for the Coast Guard, with the House and Senate recommending more funding. P.L. 113-6 provided $10,400 million in total gross budget authority for the USCG. The USCG budget for FY2013 faced cuts due to sequestration, with a projected total spending of $10,132 million. Differences in funding recommendations between the President's request and House and Senate bills were seen in vessel and aircraft acquisition, with varying amounts allocated for new fast response cutters and Response Boat Medium vessels. The USCG budget for FY2013 faced cuts due to sequestration, with a projected total spending of $10,132 million. The President, House, and Senate had differing funding recommendations for vessel and aircraft acquisitions. The President requested no funds for additional Response Boat Medium vessels, the House provided $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters, while the Senate requested $8 million for four more Response Boat Medium vessels. The DHS sequestration operating plan allocated $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including funds for a national security cutter, fast response cutters, and a new icebreaker, and $181 million for aircraft acquisitions. The Coast Guard's budget for FY2013 allocated $181 million for aircraft acquisitions, with $86 million specifically for long-range aircraft. Congress has been focused on replacing or modernizing the fleet of vessels. The House bill included $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, exceeding the President's request. Additionally, $31 million was recommended for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the Coast Guard's new headquarters building. The House Appropriations Committee called for implementing card readers for the TWIC program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on actions taken regarding Interagency Operations Centers at ports in light of a GAO report critical of the agency's development of these centers. The U.S. Secret Service has two broad missions, criminal investigations and protection, with protective duties extending to foreign missions. The U.S. Secret Service's protective duties extend to foreign missions, designated individuals, and National Special Security Events (NSSE). The agency is responsible for security at major events in the U.S. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with a focus on protection and investigation missions. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million for the USSS. The DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the U.S. Secret Service in FY2013, representing a decrease of $54 million from FY2012. This decrease was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season. However, it was $12 million more than the Administration's FY2013 request. The budget reduction would have been partially offset by funding restoration for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program and Electronic Crimes Task Forces. The Senate restored $8 million for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and provided $4 million for priority domestic investigations. They approved the USSS Director's actions regarding improper behavior in Colombia. Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than FY2012. After the sequester, USSS plans to spend $1.527 billion, $84 million less than appropriated. Funding details for FY2013 are outlined in Table 14. The USSS is facing potential transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. Congress is concerned about balancing the Service's investigative and protective missions, with a focus on the protection mission due to recent agent misconduct. There is a push for expanding the investigation mission to enhance protection efforts in response to terrorist threats and potential attacks. Congressional actions primarily address the protection mission, despite the Service's role in investigating financial crimes. Title III of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. The Administration requested $5,911 million for these accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $5,930 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $5,971 million. Both versions also included $5,481 million for disaster relief. P.L. 113-6 ultimately allocated $5,920 million for these accounts and $6,400 million for disaster relief. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration proposed moving US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other departments, while the House suggested keeping some functions within a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The Administration proposed moving US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other departments, while the House suggested keeping some functions within a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities was $1,217 million, with a decrease of $29 million compared to FY2012. The Management and Administration budget request remained at $50 million, reflecting a transfer of functions to the DHS Office of Policy. The FY2013 request for Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS) was $1,167 million, an increase of $278 million from FY2012, with a focus on securing the federal government's information. The IPIS budget request includes a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. Additional funding is allocated for US-CERT to analyze data generated by the NCPS. The FY2013 budget request includes $5 million in additional support for the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to assist state governments in cybersecurity efforts. Funding for infrastructure protection was reduced by $40 million, with a significant portion attributed to the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. Another $8 million in reductions was associated with the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises. The House proposed funding allocations for NPPD, with reductions in Management and Administration, IPIS, and NCPS projects due to program implementation issues and concerns about fund obligation. They also directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation. The House proposed funding reductions for NPPD, including cuts in the Global Cybersecurity Management and Telecommunications projects. They recommended full funding for the Federal Network Security project but directed NPPD to use the funds for developing security capabilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration and IPIS projects. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for various projects within NPPD, including allocating more funds than requested for certain projects like Security Compliance, while proposing cuts for the initiative within the Federal Network Security project. They also suggested withholding a portion of proposed funding until NPPD provides an expenditure plan and requested clarification on the restructuring of projects to a more centralized structure. Additionally, they recommended increased funding for the Global Cybersecurity Management project. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for various projects within NPPD, including allocating more funds than requested for certain projects like Security Compliance and the Global Cybersecurity Management project. They also recommended increases for the Office of Emergency Communications and other emergency communication-related projects. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, including $50 million for Management and Administration, $1,157 million for the IPIS program, and $232 million for Biometric Identity Management. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million for FY2014. The operating plan includes $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific allocations for IPIS include funds for the Office of Bombing Prevention, vulnerability assessments, cybersecurity education, CFATS, and Federal Network Security program. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided instructions related to CFATS and cybersecurity. GAO and the Coast Guard are to examine DHS progress in developing the CFATS program. NPPD was directed to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and brief on alternative security programs. Agencies were instructed to submit expenditure plans and quarterly reports on cybersecurity efforts to OMB. OMB would then summarize these reports annually to Congress. The FY2012 and FY2013 funding levels for the IPIS program are outlined in Table 16, with the DHS Plan column showing post-sequester resources. Congress is concerned about CFATS compliance issues and cybersecurity, with a focus on various bills addressing information sharing and workforce development. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. Their operations focus on security measures to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. Any legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel, including assisting other federal agencies like the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events. FPS employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers and administers the services of around 13,000 contract security guards. Their budget is funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants, with the President's FY2013 budget request including $1,302 million for FPS. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no specific changes to the FPS budget for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not recommend any specific changes to the FPS budget for FY2013. However, they required the Office of Under Secretary for NPPD and the FPS Director to brief the committee on management and budget improvement efforts. Congress continues to express concerns about FPS mission aspects and funding, with interest in improving training for contract guards, federalizing contract guards, setting standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee for building security. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance federal building security and FPS capabilities, but none were enacted. In the 113th Congress, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 was introduced to set staffing levels and pilot the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs oversees programs like BioWatch and coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations and requested $166 million for FY2013. The proposed allocation includes funding for programs like BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense, and Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, while the Senate-reported bill recommended $168 million. The committee recommended funding amounts for BioWatch, with small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses. $2 million was allocated for the Chemical Defense Program for additional pilot programs. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2012 and FY2013 were presented in Table 17, reflecting across-the-board cuts. The total enacted budget authority for FY2013 largely decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The OHA budget for FY2013 was $132 million, $35 million less than FY2012, and $34 million less than the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended merging the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate also called for a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including potential performance improvements and cost savings from the merger, to be submitted to Congress. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, is a major part of OHA's budget. There have been challenges with deploying more advanced sensors, known as Gen-3 sensors, due to technical and management issues. The estimated cost for Gen-3 sensors is $5.8 billion, raising questions about the investment justification. Congressional appropriators have shown interest in BioWatch performance and have limited funding for program expansion in FY2013. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million in net budget authority for FEMA for FY2013, an increase of $261 million (6.1%) over the enacted FY2012 level of $4,267 million. This decreased amount effectively precludes continued development and deployment of Gen-3 capability for the remainder of the fiscal year. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce the loss of life and property, and protect the nation from all hazards through a comprehensive emergency management system. The Administration requested an additional $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FY2013, funded by an adjustment to the discretionary budget cap. House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed $4,451 million for FEMA, a decrease from the President's request but an increase from FY2012. Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed $4,582 million for FEMA, an increase from the President's request and FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provided $4,351 million for FEMA, an increase from FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $4,351 million for FEMA, $84 million more than FY2012, and $177 million less than the President's request. This includes $1 million less for the DRF due to across-the-board cuts. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions, plus $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. The full range of appropriated resources available to FEMA is not represented in these numbers. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. President Obama issued a directive for a national preparedness goal to be developed in coordination with various levels of government, focusing on specific threats and vulnerabilities. The National Preparedness Goal supersedes the previous homeland security directive HSPD-8 after 9/11, defining core capabilities for preparing against domestic terrorist attacks and disasters. The goal aims for a secure and resilient Nation with integrated measures across all levels of government. Several federal grant programs are available to state and local governments to address homeland security, including the State Domestic Preparedness Program, Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG), and Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS). Additional programs like the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), and others have been added to ensure preparedness. The federal grant programs provide assistance to state and local governments for homeland security preparedness. Total public safety expenditures for all state and local governments amount to $218 billion annually, with federal grants accounting for less than one percent of this spending. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, including funding for a National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) to consolidate various preparedness grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to consolidate these programs in its report on FY2013 funding recommendations for DHS. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns about the proposal, including unclear risk assessment usage and funding allocation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and recommending continuation of the grant structure enacted in FY2012. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, allocating funds to various security grant programs such as Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and other programs. Operation Stonegarden, Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security, Port Security Grants, and education/training/exercises received funding in the amount of $676 million, $132 million, $132 million, and $234 million respectively. The total budget for state and local programs in FY2013 was $1,467 million, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from FY2012. Sequestration further reduced funding by $77 million, resulting in $1,400 million available for state and local programs. The removal of a transfer from grant programs increased actual funding by $132 million compared to FY2012. The DHS Plan column assesses post-sequester resources for FEMA state and local programs as of April 26, 2013. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. A percentage of AFG funding may be set aside for grant program management. SAFER grants could be used to maintain firefighter staffing levels. Grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office starting in FY2013. The House-passed bill and the Senate-reported bill both proposed funding firefighter assistance at $675 million, with $337.5 million allocated for AFG and $337.5 million for SAFER grants. Both bills denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. Additionally, the Senate-reported bill included SAFER waiver authority language and emphasized considering economic hardship when exercising the waiver authority. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 allocated $642 million for firefighter assistance, with AFG and SAFER each receiving $321 million. P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million, with AFG and SAFER each receiving $321 million. Administrative costs are covered by the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. The DRF is the main account for disaster assistance, funded annually through regular appropriations but often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to underfunding. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FY2013, a decrease of $1,011 million from the previous year. The request included $608 million for non-disaster activities and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs. This reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing disaster costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request was more than three times the size of the previous year's request. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, a decrease from the previous year. The request included funding for past catastrophic events, non-catastrophic events, and a reserve. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's request. P.L. 113-6 funded the DRF at $7,007 million, with $24 million transferred to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, but P.L. 113-6 provided $7,007 million, with $24 million transferred to the DHS Office of Inspector General. The Budget Control Act (BCA) includes provisions for disaster relief funding adjustments to avoid sequestration. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received funding from various federal government accounts, including $7.3 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Congress approved an additional $11.485 billion in pre-sequester resources through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. This exceeded the allowable adjustment for disaster relief for FY 2013. The Administration received emergency funding designations to cover most of the relief exceeding the allowable adjustment in FY2013. The proposal suggested eliminating the PDM program, stating it duplicated the HMGP. PDM awards are given prior to disasters, unlike NFIP programs which only address flood hazards. The Administration noted $174 million in unobligated balances for the PDM program. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills proposed reduced funding for the PDM program due to slow award pace and large unobligated balances. The post-sequester funding for PDM in FY2013 is around $25 million, presenting challenges for program administration. This funding level makes it difficult to fund state minimum awards and conduct a new round of applications and awards. FEMA may need to work from existing resources. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the EFS program funding cycle. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the program, with the House suggesting $120 million and the Senate proposing $150 million for FY2013. Post-sequester funding for FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also exist over delayed distribution of funds in FY2012. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 allocates funds for various agencies, including USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The requested amount was $1,561 million, with the House passing $1,510 million and the Senate reporting $1,535 million. The final amount after cuts was $1,520 million. The USCIS is primarily responsible for adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. Funding for USCIS comes from direct appropriations and fee income, with the Examinations Fee Account generating revenue for processing benefits. The USCIS agency receives funding from direct appropriations and fee collections, with the creation of the Examinations Fee Account generating revenue. In FY2013, the requested USCIS gross budget authority was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The direct appropriation included funding for specific programs like E-Verify and Immigrant Integration Initiative, as well as the SAVE Program. The majority of the budget was allocated for adjudication services, information and customer services, and administration. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The recommended level did not include funds for a pay increase but directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. Military naturalizations were not funded by the Committee. The House Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program, allocating $20 million from user fee revenues instead. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants. The Committee recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations and an additional $5 million via fees. They expressed concern about the costs of administering the grant program and directed that no more than 5% of the funding be used for administration. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $114 million for DHS, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would reduce this to $109 million. The enacted amounts for USCIS for FY2012, the Administration's request for FY2013, and the House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations were listed. Potential issues for Congress included fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. The House Committee directed USCIS to include operation costs in future fee adjustments. The House Committee expressed concerns about funding immigrant integration grants and the USCIS Transformation program. They allocated $7.5 million from fee revenue for grants in FY2013, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations. The Committee also questioned the justification for continued investment in the current contract for the Transformation program. The Committee questioned the justification for continued investment in the current contract for the USCIS Transformation program, citing little capability delivered despite $597 million obligated from FY2006 to January 2012. Concerns about the operability of the E-Verify program were raised, leading to the House bill extending its authorization for one year. Both the House and Senate Committees directed USCIS to address issues with E-Verify, including creating a review process for final non-confirmations and exploring its effectiveness in the agricultural industry. Challenges in agriculture include non-office-based hiring, limited Internet access, seasonal employment, and high turnover. The House Committee supported efforts to increase efficiency and reduce expenses in USCIS operations by converting immigration records to digital format. They also urged DHS to review refugee processing procedures to streamline processing while maintaining security vetting. The Senate Committee encouraged DHS to use its parole authority under Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to address urgent humanitarian needs, particularly in the interest of family unity and to address medical emergencies following natural disasters. They also urged the Secretary to allocate sufficient resources for appropriate responsiveness to future disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides law enforcement instruction to federal, state, local, and international agencies to promote consistency and collaboration. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) administers training at various sites in the US, with an annual budget proposal of $258 million, a reduction of $13 million from the previous year. The budget includes two appropriations for Salaries and Expenses ($229 million) and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses ($29 million). The proposed reductions were due to efficiencies and deferred construction work. The House-passed bill allocated $256 million for FLETC, slightly below the requested amount. The House Appropriations Committee report cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases as the reason for reducing the Acquisition budget by $2 million. Senate-reported S. 3216 allocated $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $257 million for FLETC, a decrease from the requested level. Sequestration would further reduce funding to $245 million for FLETC. The Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary DHS organization for research and development. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is responsible for research and development within DHS, with a focus on funding R&D in various laboratories. The Administration requested $831 million for S&T in FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The largest increase in funding was for disaster resilience R&D. There was a reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. The House-passed bill for FY2013 provided less funding than requested for the Science and Technology Directorate, with a specific reduction in funding for Research, Development, and Innovation. The bill allocated more funding for Laboratory Facilities, directing an increase to be spent on NBAF construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels consistent with the Administration's request, but specified separate amounts for different research areas and did not allocate any funding for NBAF construction due to the high total cost estimate. The FY2013 budget provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate, with $28 million less than requested for RDI. $37 million is allocated for Laboratory Facilities, specifically for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for S&T is $801 million. DNDO is responsible for nuclear detection efforts within DHS. See Table 22 for DNDO funding breakdown from FY2012 to FY2013. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 13% from FY2012. The request included an increase of $44 million for Transformational R&D, with a decrease in Systems Development funding. The House-passed bill proposed $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than the request, with reductions mainly in Transformational R&D. The committee recommended merging DNDO with OHA for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against WMDs. They directed DHS to submit a plan for the merger in FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request for DNDO. The Senate bill also required an updated implementation plan for domestic nuclear detection. The Senate report did not mention annual requirements or the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. P.L. 113-6 provides $318 million for DNDO, $9 million less than the request for Transformational R&D. DHS is directed to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The explanatory statement directs DHS to review its WMD programs and evaluate consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. Post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million. Funding levels for existing DNDO program functions are outlined in Table 22. The DHS appropriations bill includes general provisions that may involve transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the previous year's bill, including rescissions and one-time provisions. Five provisions were permanent changes in the U.S. Code. The Administration proposed changes to the U.S. Code, including removing 15 \"restrictive\" provisions and adding 5 new provisions related to E-Verify, FEMA, dam safety, customs inspectors, and CBP services. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes $292 million in rescissions to reduce the bill's net scoring. The House concurred with the Administration's request to drop 22 general provisions and added 13 general provisions to the bill during floor action. These amendments included prohibiting funds from being used to contravene constitutional protections, enforce certain ICE rules, pay for the position of Public Advocate within ICE, and enforce a section of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The bill includes provisions prohibiting the government from contracting for alternative transportation fuels that do not produce fewer greenhouse gases, allowing CBP to use funds for operations in Puerto Rico, restricting sharing of immigration status information, and prohibiting the purchase of certain vehicles and armed unmanned aerial vehicles. Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act grants the Attorney General authority to detain and release criminal aliens. An executive order mandates federal agencies to provide services to individuals with limited English proficiency. ICE policy memos on immigration enforcement priorities are to be finalized and enforced, while an agreement allowing local officials to act as immigration officers under Section 287(g) will be terminated. Senate-reported S. 3216 includes $192 million in rescissions and provisions impacting bill scoring, offsetting costs by $68 million. The Senate agreed to drop 15 general provisions but disagreed on the necessity of 17 others. The Senate Appropriations Committee modified provisions providing funding to DHS initiatives for FY2013, including reimbursement of security costs, migration and consolidation of data centers, and DHS headquarters consolidation. The enacted bill included $307 million in rescissions and general provisions offsetting the cost of the act by $202 million. Ten general provisions sought by the Administration were dropped, and one was modified in the final bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee modified provisions for funding DHS initiatives in FY2013, including reimbursement of security costs, data center migration, and DHS headquarters consolidation. The enacted bill included $307 million in rescissions and general provisions offsetting the cost by $202 million. Several provisions providing funding to DHS initiatives were funded in the Senate-reported bill, including immigrant integration grants, security cost reimbursements, data center migration, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves a multi-step process starting with the enactment of budget authority by Congress, followed by fund obligation and outlays. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. Budget authority allows federal agencies to spend within limits set by Congress. It can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with obligations incurred through personnel, contracts, and services. Outlays are actual funds spent in a fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority. Multi-year and no-year budget authority can be spent over several years. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory spending provided in laws other than appropriation acts. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes both discretionary and mandatory spending. Mandatory entitlement programs, such as Coast Guard retirement pay, must be appropriated each year. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government to offset discretionary spending. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. The DHS budget also contains Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress. Homeland security funding has been a focus since 9/11, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism including analysis on homeland security funding. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes various components such as Secret Service and Coast Guard retirement pay. DHS funding analysis has become more refined over the years, with distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities becoming more precise. While DHS funding is a significant portion of federal spending on homeland security, other agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services also contribute. These top five agencies collectively account for approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. The DHS budget accounted for 93% of federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is for homeland security activities, as legacy agencies also conduct other activities. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion specifically for homeland security. Inconsistencies exist between homeland security budget authority and total budget authority. Authoritative data for FY2013 is not available due to the impact of sequestration."
