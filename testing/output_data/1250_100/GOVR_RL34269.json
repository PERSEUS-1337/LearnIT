    "content": "Diversity of viewpoint in U.S. communications policy is supported by Congress and the FCC through programs promoting ownership diversity, especially among minorities and females. The courts have emphasized the importance of minority ownership in media rules. The FCC is mandated to consider the impact of its ownership rules on minority ownership. Measures are being considered to improve data on minority and female ownership for future decision-making. Bills in Congress have been introduced to revive tax incentives for businesses acquiring broadcast properties. In efforts to promote ownership diversity, especially among minorities, businesses seeking telecommunications properties may face strict court review if defining minorities based on race. The FCC previously operated a tax certificate program to aid minority-owned businesses in acquiring broadcast properties. The program faced scrutiny in 1995 when Viacom structured a deal with a minority-owned business. In 1995, Viacom structured a deal with a minority-owned business to acquire a broadcast property, contingent on receiving a tax certificate from the FCC. Congress raised concerns about the deal potentially allowing Viacom to defer $440-640 million in taxes, leading to the repeal of IRC \u00a71071. Additionally, the FCC's \"distress sale\" policy, aimed at promoting minority ownership of broadcast stations, has seen a decline in usage since the Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a Supreme Court ruling. The FCC issued a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2007 to review Broadcast Ownership Rules, proposing amendments including defining Socially Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs). New rules were adopted in 2007 to promote diversification of broadcast ownership, defining eligible entities based on Small Business Administration standards. Further comments were sought on expanding the definition of \"eligible entity.\" The FCC is considering expanding the definition of \"eligible entity\" to improve data on minority and female ownership of broadcast properties. New information may be used to develop programs to encourage ownership by minorities and women, but any race-based programs would need to withstand strict scrutiny as per the Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a. The Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a requires government actions at any level to comply with strict scrutiny, proving the necessity of measures for a compelling government interest and ensuring they are narrowly tailored. This is in line with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, protecting individuals from discrimination based on race. Any law or regulation defining SDBs based on race or ethnicity must meet strict scrutiny. The government's interest in promoting broadcast viewpoint diversity through tax provisions and FCC programs for SDB ownership must be compelling to withstand this scrutiny. The Supreme Court has recognized the importance of promoting broadcast viewpoint diversity to ensure a variety of voices and perspectives in public discourse. While the government's interest in enhancing broadcast diversity has been upheld in previous cases like Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, the level of scrutiny required for such policies to survive remains a topic of debate. The Court has acknowledged that diversity of viewpoints benefits the public, but whether this interest is compelling enough to pass strict scrutiny is still uncertain. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of promoting broadcast viewpoint diversity to ensure a variety of voices and perspectives in public discourse. In Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, the Court grounded their analysis in the scarcity of electromagnetic spectrum and the government's duty to distribute it for the widest array of information sources. They highlighted the public's right to receive diverse viewpoints over broadcast airwaves, leading to the conclusion that minority ownership policies are justified to uphold First Amendment principles. The Court's application of a lower standard of scrutiny to \"benign racial classification\" requires deeper analysis to determine if the government interest is compelling enough to withstand strict scrutiny. Justice O'Connor acknowledged the persistence of racial discrimination's effects but suggested that strict scrutiny should only allow racial classifications to remedy past discrimination. The dissent in Metro Broadcasting argued that broadcast ownership diversity was not a compelling interest, questioning the legitimacy of race-based classifications for other justifications. The Court in Grutter v. Bollinger recognized diversity as a compelling interest, not limited to remedying past discrimination. Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of University of California v. Bakke emphasized the importance of diverse viewpoints in education. The Grutter decision upheld this analysis, highlighting the need for a diverse student body to enhance the learning experience. The Grutter majority justified the importance of a diverse student body in fulfilling the university's mission, citing educational benefits and First Amendment principles. This parallels the compelling interest in diversity seen in broadcast programming. The government must prove that broadcast diversity is a compelling interest, necessary for increasing diverse viewpoints. The Supreme Court has yet to define narrow tailoring in this context, but examples from other cases may provide guidance. The government must show that diversity in broadcast ownership leads to diverse programming. The Court found that increased diversity of broadcast property ownership is related to increased diversity of broadcast programming, but it does not necessarily mean it is \"necessary.\" The dissenting Justices in Metro Broadcasting raised concerns about the lack of evidence linking diversity among owners to diversity of viewpoint, questioning the necessity of a policy favoring minority ownership for increasing viewpoint diversity. The dissenters in Metro Broadcasting questioned the necessity of a policy favoring minority ownership for increasing viewpoint diversity, arguing that the evidence supporting the nexus between broadcast programming diversity and diversity among broadcast property owners was weak. They suggested a closer examination of the factual basis supporting minority ownership policies in the future. The government must show evidence of a correlation between diversity of ownership and viewpoint in programming to justify policies for increasing broadcast viewpoint diversity. It must also consider race-neutral alternatives before adopting programs that take race into account. If diversity of ownership is deemed necessary for viewpoint diversity, the government must prove that the program is narrowly tailored to achieve this goal. In Metro Broadcasting, dissenters criticized policies benefiting certain minorities as unconstitutional quotas. School admissions policies with rigid numeric goals for minority inclusion violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court in Grutter allowed race as a factor in admissions without strict quotas. The Supreme Court allows race to be considered as a factor in admissions decisions to promote diversity without strict quotas. Individualized assessments are used to determine how an applicant can contribute to student body diversity, ensuring that race is just one of many factors considered. This approach alleviates constitutional concerns by not solely basing admissions on group membership and does not unfairly burden non-minority applicants. Similarly, in promoting diversity in broadcast ownership, a program that considers race as one of several factors contributing to diversity of viewpoint may be upheld if narrowly tailored. In promoting diversity in broadcast ownership, a program that considers race as a factor must be narrowly tailored with reasonable durational limits, similar to admissions preferences. Sunset provisions or periodic reviews may be necessary to determine the ongoing need for racial preferences in minority ownership programs enacted by Congress or the FCC."
