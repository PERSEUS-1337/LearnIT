The Congress acknowledges the impact of expanded credit access on homeownership rates but expresses concern over predatory lending practices, particularly in the subprime market. Borrowers with fair credit can access prime loans with lower costs, while those with poor credit face higher rates and fees in the subprime market. Predatory lending involves unjustifiably high interest rates and fees in various types of home loans. Predatory loans with high interest rates, fees, and unreasonable terms have disproportionately affected minority neighborhoods, leading to the loss of wealth accumulated over decades. Lack of access to traditional institutions has made cash-poor homeowners vulnerable to predatory practices by second mortgage lenders and finance companies. Many borrowers struggle to understand loan terms and face foreclosure due to overwhelming mortgage payments. A joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Treasury aims to curb predatory home mortgage lending. The joint report in 2000 called for legislation to restrict abusive terms on high-cost loans, improve consumer literacy, and disclosures, and prohibit predatory lending practices. Government agencies are working to address predatory lending issues and reduce high-pressure tactics by lenders. Predatory lending practices, such as high-pressure telemarketing and misleading borrowers about interest rates, threaten the efforts of nonprofit organizations and local governments to improve distressed neighborhoods. More assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans, consumer education on home loan risks, and referrals to consumer protection agencies. Grant program established for education and counseling on predatory lending. The Secretary of the Treasury may grant funds to States, local governments, and nonprofits for eligible anti-predatory lending activities. These activities include education programs to inform vulnerable consumers about unfair lending practices and counseling programs provided by certified organizations. To be eligible for a grant under this section, organizations must be certified to provide homeownership counseling on predatory lending practices. Referral services are also available for homeowners and prospective homeowners to access education programs, counseling, or agencies handling consumer complaints related to home loans. Eligible entities can apply for grants by submitting an application to the Secretary. The Secretary requires grant applications to include necessary information for eligible activities. The maximum grant amount for a single grantee is $1,000,000 per fiscal year. States, local governments, and nonprofits can apply for grants, with the Secretary selecting recipients based on established criteria. SEC. 4.

The telephone line will be staffed by actual people at all times. SEC. 5. A Predatory Lending Advisory Council will be formed.
