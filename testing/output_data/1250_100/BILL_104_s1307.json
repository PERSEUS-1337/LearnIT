    "content": "The \"Treatment of Indian Tribal Natural Resource Income Act of 1995\" is cited as the short title. It addresses the federal tax treatment of income derived by Indians from the harvest of tribally owned natural resources. No tax imposed on income from natural resources-related activities conducted by Indian tribes or qualified Indian entities. No tax on remuneration for services in natural resources-related activities within tribes. Definitions include activities related to cultivating, harvesting, processing, extracting, or selling natural resources by tribe members. Qualified Indian entity refers to an entity engaged in natural resources activities of Indian tribes, with all equity owned by tribes or their members, and management functions primarily performed by tribe members. Additionally, entities involved in processing or transportation with 90% of annual gross receipts from natural resources activities are also included. A qualified Indian entity is defined as an entity with annual gross receipts primarily from natural resources activities of Indian tribes, with at least 90% ownership by tribes or their members. Special rules apply for distributions from such entities to tribal members, attributing income to natural resources-related activities. The text discusses the entitlement of benefits for payments made to a qualified Indian tribal entity or tribal member for services. It also mentions that no inference should be created regarding tax exemptions for income derived from tribal rights secured before January 1, 1995. Sec. 7874 addresses the federal tax treatment of income from tribally owned natural resources by Indians. The amendments made by this section apply to periods before, on, or after the enactment of this Act."
