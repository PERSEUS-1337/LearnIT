    "content": "Housing counseling organizations provide information on housing issues to various populations, such as prospective homebuyers, homeowners, renters, and the homeless. The federal government supports private housing counseling agencies financially through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD certifies agencies that meet criteria and provides competitive grants for housing counseling activities, but not all certified agencies receive grants. HUD's housing counseling grants do not cover agencies' full costs; most funding comes from other sources. Funding for HUD's housing counseling program fluctuates yearly, with increases over the last decade. Congress did not provide funding in FY2011 but resumed in FY2012. Additional funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling has been allocated to NeighborWorks America since FY2008. Housing counseling is part of financial education, supported by various government departments. The federal government, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Defense, provides support for housing counseling aimed at specific groups. While housing counseling is voluntary, some programs require it. However, additional funds are not always provided, leading to agencies counseling more people with less time and money. This report gives an overview of federal support for housing counseling activities. Housing counseling organizations become eligible for federal funds through HUD, which are distributed to support counseling activities related to financial literacy. This includes helping individuals and families with budgeting, managing finances, and understanding complex financial concepts to make sound decisions. Housing counseling can be provided alongside financial counseling, with some overlap between the two. Housing counseling encompasses a wide range of activities, including counseling for various populations with different housing goals. It often focuses on homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, offering pre-purchase and post-purchase counseling. Some organizations provide both housing counseling and financial literacy counseling, while others specialize in one or the other. Housing counseling covers pre-purchase and post-purchase topics such as financial literacy, homeownership responsibilities, housing programs, maintenance, budgeting, and mortgage delinquency. Curricula vary among organizations and cater to renters, Section 8 voucher holders, and individuals seeking housing in low-poverty communities. Housing counseling can cover a variety of topics and be provided in different ways, including individual or group sessions, in person or over the phone, and varying in length from one session to several spread out over weeks or months. HUD generally prefers face-to-face counseling for housing counseling, but allows other forms in certain situations such as remote areas, seniors, or foreclosure cases. Group education classes are permitted, but topics must also be covered in individual sessions. Counseling is believed to help households make better housing decisions. Housing counseling for homebuyers is believed to provide benefits to both buyers and lenders. Pre-purchase counseling helps buyers understand mortgage terms and responsibilities, while post-purchase counseling helps reduce delinquencies and foreclosure risks. Counseling also helps lenders by reducing default rates and screening out unprepared borrowers. Critics argue that the effectiveness of housing counseling is uncertain due to limited research on outcomes and lack of consensus on the best types of counseling. Pre-purchase counseling often occurs after a borrower has already chosen a home and mortgage, potentially limiting its benefits in guiding the homebuying process or identifying unprepared borrowers. Housing counseling is voluntary for various populations, but some federal programs require it as a condition. Some housing programs, federal and otherwise, mandate housing counseling for participation. Examples include Section 255 of the National Housing Act for senior citizens seeking a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), USDA's Section 502 direct loan program for first-time homebuyers, HUD's Homeownership Voucher Program, and the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) incentivizes mortgage servicers to modify loans for eligible borrowers to prevent foreclosures. Participants with a debt-to-income ratio of 55% or higher must receive housing counseling. Homebuyers using funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) must also undergo housing counseling. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) allocate 10% of their net income to the Affordable Housing Program (AHP), which includes a competitive grant program and a voluntary homeownership set-aside program. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) have a mandatory homeownership set-aside program that requires housing counseling for first-time homebuyers. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also require counseling for certain borrowers using affordable mortgage products. State housing finance agencies (SHFAs) offer low-cost mortgage programs and encourage housing counseling for eligible households. The Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to require pre-purchase housing counseling for borrowers of high-cost mortgages. FHA does not currently use its authority to charge lower insurance premiums for borrowers who receive housing counseling. Housing counseling is not typically required by the federal government for most housing decisions, but may be necessary for certain mortgage products. HUD-approved agencies primarily assist prospective homebuyers and homeowners, with a small portion of counseling activities focused on renters and the homeless. Rental counseling accounts for about 15% of counseling activities, while counseling for the homeless makes up around 2%. Housing counseling is provided by various organizations, including for-profit and nonprofit agencies. Only nonprofit organizations certified by HUD are eligible for HUD grants. Agencies vary in size and specialization, with some focusing on specific types of counseling like HECM or foreclosure mitigation, while others offer comprehensive counseling on a range of housing issues. Some organizations that provide financial literacy counseling may also offer housing counseling. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies differ from other agencies in important ways. They must be nonprofit organizations and are more likely to offer face-to-face counseling. Non-approved agencies may provide more telephone counseling or group education classes. There are no standard curricula for housing counselors. NeighborWorks America is one organization promoting standardized training for housing counselors, while studies on the effectiveness of housing counseling have been limited in scope, with some evidence of positive outcomes in the past. Several early studies funded by HUD found evidence that pre-purchase and post-purchase counseling could reduce default or foreclosure rates. However, these studies had limited focus, varied definitions of success, and methodological issues. A 2001 review described the results as \"highly ambiguous.\" Few empirical studies on housing counseling effectiveness were done until the mid- to late 1990s. Newer studies aim to determine if housing counseling achieves desired outcomes, with one study by Hirad and Zorn in 2001 showing that pre-purchase counseling reduced the likelihood of mortgage delinquency. The effectiveness of housing counseling in reducing mortgage delinquency rates has been studied, with face-to-face counseling showing better results than phone or self-study methods. Research has indicated positive effects of both pre- and post-purchase counseling, but attributing these effects solely to counseling is challenging due to methodological limitations. Overall, housing counseling faces challenges in evaluating its effectiveness due to a lack of data, difficulties in defining counseling, and the absence of a standard curriculum. While some evidence suggests positive outcomes, it is limited to certain programs or groups, making it difficult to generalize the effectiveness of housing counseling. The federal government primarily supports housing counseling through HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program, which certifies agencies meeting specific criteria and provides grants. The legislative authority for this program is found at 12 U.S.C. Section 1701x, established in 1968. The federal government supports housing counseling through HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program, which certifies agencies meeting specific criteria and provides grants. In 1970, the Housing and Urban Development Act amended the law to add counseling for individuals to the list of services provided by HUD for low- and moderate-income families in federal housing programs. In 1974, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-383) authorized HUD to provide housing counseling for renters and homeowners, allowing monetary grants to housing counseling agencies for the first time. HUD can provide counseling directly or contract with other organizations, but it has chosen to support outside agencies for housing counseling services. HUD has supported housing counseling services by certifying agencies since 1970. Congress began regularly funding HUD for housing counseling in FY1977, except for FY2011. Funding is used to award grants to HUD-approved agencies. Eligibility for grants requires certification by HUD or being a state housing finance agency. To receive counseling grants, agencies must be certified by HUD or be a state housing finance agency. HUD certifies four types of housing counseling agencies: local, multi-state, regional, and national intermediaries. Local agencies have one main office and branch offices in one or two states, while multi-state agencies operate in two or more states. Regional and national intermediaries provide counseling services through a network of branches and affiliates covering a broader geographic area. National intermediaries and regional intermediaries are defined by HUD as agencies that provide administrative and financial support services to their branches and affiliates, who offer housing counseling directly to individuals. These intermediaries also apply for and distribute HUD funding. State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) are also eligible for HUD funding and are state-chartered authorities that administer affordable housing programs. SHFAs do not need to be certified by HUD. Housing counseling agencies do not need to be certified by HUD to receive funding. Agencies certified by HUD must be nonprofit organizations with at least one year of experience in housing counseling services. They must also have operated in the geographic area they plan to provide counseling for at least one year. The agency must have adequate resources, facilities, familiarity with housing programs, relationships with community resources, reporting and monitoring systems, and conduct standards in place to provide housing counseling for at least one year. The agency must meet specific criteria to work with HUD's databases, including not being suspended or debarred, conducting counseling directly, and meeting state and local requirements. The application process for HUD approval varies for different types of agencies. When a housing counseling agency applies to be a national or regional intermediary or an MSO, they submit a single application to HUD headquarters. If approved, the agency becomes a HUD-approved housing counseling organization for up to three years, subject to periodic performance reviews. Branch offices and affiliates do not need separate approval but must meet HUD criteria through the parent office. LHCA, MSO, or intermediary applications include branches and affiliates, and performance reviews determine approval status. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies must provide individualized, face-to-face counseling to clients, with the option for telephone counseling if preferred. They are also required to offer group educational sessions and refer clients to other agencies if they cannot provide specific services. Agencies may charge fees for counseling under certain circumstances. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies may charge fees for counseling under certain circumstances, but must provide free counseling for clients unable to pay. Fees cannot be charged for services already funded by HUD grants. Agencies can also accept fees from lenders but must disclose them to clients. Each agency must submit a housing counseling work plan to HUD outlining the types of counseling they provide. A minimum of 30 clients must be counseled per year, except for agencies offering only reverse mortgage counseling. Funding for housing counseling has been regularly appropriated by Congress since FY1977, with fluctuations in appropriations each year. Funding for housing counseling has fluctuated over the years, with appropriations generally staying flat in the 1980s, trending upward in the 1990s, and rising sharply in FY2003. After a period of flat funding, appropriations began to rise again in FY2008, peaking in FY2011 before Congress did not provide any funding. Funding resumed in FY2012 at a lower amount. Policymakers' interest in housing counseling has varied based on housing program results, policy goals, and market conditions. The increased interest in lending to underserved populations, driven by new requirements such as the Community Reinvestment Act amendments and Affordable Housing Goals set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, led to a rise in housing counseling funding. Congressional appropriations for housing counseling rose in the mid- to late 1990s and significantly in FY2003, reflecting the high demand for counseling services. The need for increased funding for housing counseling, including training and support for new homeownership initiatives, rose significantly in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 in response to the increase in foreclosures. Policymakers may appropriate more funding for delinquency and default counseling to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, as well as for pre-purchase counseling to prevent future foreclosures. However, in FY2011, Congress did not provide funding for HUD's housing counseling program due to the fiscal environment for discretionary spending. In FY2011, Congress did not provide funding for HUD's housing counseling program due to the fiscal environment for discretionary spending. HUD's housing counseling funds are often distributed in the following fiscal year, leading to concerns about delays. Critics argue that the funding duplicates NeighborWorks America's foreclosure mitigation counseling funds, but proponents highlight the wider variety of counseling types HUD funding supports. The FY2012 HUD appropriations law allocated $45 million for housing counseling, the lowest level since FY2011. HUD's housing counseling program received its lowest level of funding since FY2007, with $55 million requested for FY2013. Agencies must be HUD-certified to be eligible for grants, awarded competitively through a Notice of Funding Availability. HUD sets maximum grant amounts for organizations applying for housing counseling grants. LHCAs and MSOs apply for HUD grants directly and use the funding for their counseling programs. Intermediaries receiving HUD grants pass on the funding to their branches or affiliates, who must meet HUD approval requirements. Branches or affiliates of HUD-approved intermediaries may also be HUD-certified as LHCAs or MSOs. They can apply for grants directly or through an intermediary, but cannot double dip in the same year. A local housing counseling agency may choose to receive funding as a branch or affiliate of an intermediary instead of applying directly to HUD. Agencies applying for HUD housing counseling funds are evaluated based on criteria outlined in HUD's NOFA, including capacity, geographic need, program quality, ability to leverage resources, and results. Points are awarded for each criterion, with only agencies meeting a minimum threshold eligible for funding. Grant amounts are based on points scored, usually the lower of the agency's request or points-based amount. The distribution of HUD's housing counseling grants varies annually based on funding appropriations. Grant amounts are determined by points scored by agencies, with fluctuations in the number of grants awarded and average grant sizes. Some organizations may receive multiple grants for different types of counseling services. In FY2012, HUD awarded nearly 540 housing counseling grants to local housing counseling agencies, intermediaries, and state housing finance agencies. The majority of grants were given to local housing counseling agencies, with about 480 grants awarded to LHCAs or MSOs, 40 grants to intermediaries, and 15 grants to SHFAs. The number of distinct organizations receiving HUD housing counseling funding remained fairly steady between FY2004 and FY2008. The number of distinct housing counseling agencies receiving HUD funding remained steady between FY2004 and FY2008, ranging from about 360 to 420 organizations. In FY2009 and FY2010, the number increased to nearly 500 and 515, respectively, before decreasing to around 470 in FY2012. Intermediaries receive a larger total amount of funding from HUD compared to local housing counseling agencies, with SHFAs receiving the least amount each year. In FY2012, intermediaries received almost $28 million, LHCAs received almost $12 million, and SHFAs received about $2.5 million. The average grant size for intermediaries was about $700,000, for LHCAs was about $24,000, and for SHFAs was about $168,000. The average grant size for comprehensive counseling fluctuated between $77,000 in FY2012 and over $107,000 in FY2008. Funding for comprehensive counseling increased as appropriations to the housing counseling program rose, reaching nearly $54 million in FY2010 before dropping to about $36 million in FY2012. The number of grants for comprehensive counseling also varied, increasing from about 360 grants in FY2004 to about 510 grants in FY2010, then decreasing to nearly 470 grants in FY2012. In recent years, HUD's funding for specialized counseling has varied, ranging from $3 million in FY2006 to nearly $19 million in FY2010. The types of specialized counseling grants awarded by HUD have also changed over time. In recent years, HUD awarded funding for various types of counseling, including HECM counseling, housing counseling training, and Mortgage Modification and Mortgage Scams Assistance (MMSA) counseling. The majority of housing counseling activities focused on homeownership counseling, with about 85% of counseling activities assisted with HUD housing counseling grants in FY2010. In FY2010, the majority of counseling activities funded by HUD were related to homeownership, with mortgage delinquency counseling making up the largest proportion. Mortgage delinquency counseling accounted for about 65% of total counseling activities, while pre-purchase and rental counseling each accounted for between 10% and 15%. Other post-purchase counseling accounted for just under 10%, and homelessness counseling accounted for under 2%. In FY2011, the percentage of counseling activities for mortgage delinquency was slightly lower, at about 56%. In FY2011, activities for mortgage delinquency counseling decreased to about 56%. Pre-purchase, post-purchase, and rental counseling accounted for 10-15% each, while homelessness counseling was just over 2%. The total counseling units provided by HUD-approved agencies dropped to 1.4 million from 2.2 million in FY2010. Federal funding for housing counseling comes from appropriations to HUD's program and other sources like NeighborWorks America, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Defense. HUD plays a significant role in housing counseling, administering federal funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling through various programs like the Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnerships Program. States and localities can use these funds for housing counseling in certain situations. NeighborWorks America, established by Congress in 1978, is a nonprofit corporation that supports community revitalization activities and affordable housing. It has a national network of over 235 organizations in all 50 states. Funding from programs like the Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnerships Program can be used for housing counseling, with specific requirements for each program. NeighborWorks America has a national network of over 235 organizations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Organizations must meet criteria and pass an inspection to become affiliates. It can take up to two years to become a chartered member. NeighborWorks affiliates are eligible for funding and technical assistance. The organization receives congressional appropriations for various programs, including the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. Regular appropriations are used for grants, training, and technical assistance for affiliates. NeighborWorks affiliates engage in various activities, including housing counseling. While some of NeighborWorks's annual appropriation may be used for housing counseling, it is not specifically dedicated to it. NeighborWorks is a HUD-approved intermediary that receives housing counseling grants from HUD and provides training in the field. In addition to its regular appropriation, NeighborWorks administers funding specifically for foreclosure mitigation counseling, which began as the number of homes entering foreclosure rose in 2006. Congress provides funding for housing counseling for borrowers at risk of foreclosure. Congress began providing funding for housing counseling for borrowers at risk of default or foreclosure through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), administered by NeighborWorks. The NFMCP funding is separate from NeighborWorks' regular annual appropriation and is distributed to HUD-approved counseling intermediaries, state housing finance agencies, or NeighborWorks affiliates. Funding for the NFMCP was first provided in 2008 with $180 million, and has been continued by Congress five more times. In FY2011, Congress did not fund HUD's housing counseling program but continued to fund the NFMCP at its FY2010 level. In FY2012, Congress provided more funding to the NFMCP than in previous years. NeighborWorks distributed NFMCP funding to over 170 organizations by June 2011, providing counseling to nearly 1.2 million homeowners. States like California, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois received the most assistance through the NFMCP. The VA employs loan counselors to help veterans facing foreclosure, recommending HUD's housing counseling program for additional support. The VA recommends veterans consider pre-purchase counseling with HUD-approved housing counselors for VA-guaranteed loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created a program for financial literacy counseling for prospective homebuyers. This program focuses on housing-related decisions and aims to help buyers with budgeting, credit improvement, and savings. Organizations receiving grants must be HUD-approved or approved by Treasury's Office of Financial Education. The Financial Education and Counseling pilot program, administered by the CDFI Fund, received funding from Congress in FY2009 and FY2010. The program required organizations to be certified by the Office of Financial Education and demonstrate experience in financial education. Funding recipients were announced in October 2010, with a specific allocation for an organization in Hawaii. No funding was provided in FY2011 or FY2012. Additionally, P.L. 110-289 directed the Department of Defense to establish a foreclosure counseling program for servicemembers returning from active duty abroad. The Department of Defense established a foreclosure counseling program for servicemembers returning from active duty abroad. P.L. 110-289 directed HUD to conduct a demonstration program on pre-purchase counseling effectiveness for first-time homebuyers with FHA-insured loans. The program included various counseling methods and involved 4,000 homebuyers. Funding from HUD's Transformation Initiative was used for this study conducted by Abt Associates. The study by Abt and HUD will enroll 4,000 first-time homebuyers in 2012. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are encouraged to seek funding from sources other than HUD grants. A 2008 report by Abt Associates revealed that HUD funding accounted for only 13.5% of agencies' total funding, with other sources including federal programs, state and local governments, financial institutions, and foundations. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies receive funding from various sources including financial institutions, foundations, public housing authorities, government-sponsored enterprises, state governments, and federal programs like the HOME program and CDBG. In total, agencies receive just under 25% of their funding from federal sources other than HUD's housing counseling program. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies can now charge clients reasonable fees for counseling services, as long as it doesn't create a financial burden. They can also receive fees from lenders as long as there is no conflict of interest and it's disclosed to the client. This change in policy has led to some current issues in the housing counseling industry. Many agree on the lack of standardization in the housing counseling industry, including training procedures and counseling curricula. HUD certifies agencies but not individual counselors, leading to concerns about poor advice, conflicts of interest, and fraud. There is no consensus on what constitutes housing counseling or the necessary standards for certification. Standardizing training and approval processes for housing counseling agencies and counselors can help deter illegitimate organizations and ensure the best interests of clients. Efforts to develop industry-wide standards have been driven by both the housing counseling and mortgage finance industries, as well as the federal government. In 1996, Fannie Mae established the American Homeowner Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) to create national accreditation standards for housing counseling providers. The American Homeowner Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) was established in 1996 with goals including setting national accreditation standards for housing counseling providers and developing a core housing counseling curriculum. Despite some progress, AHECI no longer exists today. NeighborWorks's Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling (NCHEC) has taken on some of AHECI's work, such as establishing standards for housing counseling curricula and certifying housing counselors. The National Association of Housing Counselors and Agencies (NAHCA) provides training, testing, and certification for housing counseling agencies.

The National Association of Housing Counselors and Agencies (NAHCA) provides training, testing, and certification for housing counseling agencies. HUD published a Final Rule in 2009 specifying requirements for HECM counselors, including being employed by a HUD-approved agency, passing a standardized exam, and receiving HECM-related training. The SAFE Act, part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, requires states to establish licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators. Responsibility for the SAFE Act was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011. HUD issued a Final Rule in 2011 implementing minimum standards for licensing and registration of mortgage originators. Some housing counseling agencies expressed concerns about the rule potentially covering housing counselors involved in pre-purchase or foreclosure mitigation counseling. The SAFE Act requires compliance with licensing and registration requirements for individuals involved in loan origination. HUD clarified that traditional housing counseling activities may not fall under loan origination, but certain activities could require compliance with the SAFE Act. The Final Rule exempted certain employees from complying with the SAFE Act, including those working for state housing finance agencies, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations engaged in residential mortgage origination for public or charitable purposes. The CFPB published an interim final rule in December 2011, similar to rules previously issued by HUD and federal banking regulators. This rule addressed loan modification activities and became effective on December 30, 2011. Policymakers have looked to housing counseling as a way to reduce mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures since 2006. Several housing counseling agencies, such as NeighborWorks and the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, have initiatives to address delinquency and foreclosure issues. NeighborWorks has a Center for Foreclosure Solutions providing training and research, while the Homeownership Preservation Foundation offers a hotline for homeowners facing foreclosure. The hotline connects homeowners with counselors to assist with programs like the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The HAMP program requires counseling for homeowners with debt-to-income ratios over 55%. Funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling primarily comes from NeighborWorks America. Counseling agencies may face increased demand due to more people seeking help with mortgage issues. According to NeighborWorks, fewer HAMP participants with high debt-to-income ratios have been referred to counseling than expected. Over 7,000 borrowers in HAMP trial modifications received counseling through the NFMCP by June 30, 2011. The lower-than-expected referrals may be due to servicers not consistently referring borrowers or borrowers not pursuing counseling despite the requirement. The average total debt-to-income ratio of participants in the program was over 59% even after a mortgage modification. Securing funding remains an issue for housing counseling agencies, despite increased funding from Congress in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Act established an Office of Housing Counseling within HUD to oversee counseling activities for homeownership and rental housing. Funding for HUD's housing counseling program has been inconsistent, with Congress providing funding in FY2012 but not in FY2011. Despite increased demand for counseling services, funding remains a challenge for housing counseling agencies. The Secretary is directed to establish standards for homeownership counseling materials and forms, certify software programs for evaluating mortgage products, provide advice and assistance to states and nonprofits for consumer education programs, offer financial assistance to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies, inform consumers about home inspection counseling, and develop related materials. The Director of the Office of Housing Counseling is tasked with establishing rules and collaborating with community-based organizations to provide housing counseling in underdeveloped areas. A public awareness campaign is also required to target populations that may benefit from housing counseling. Only HUD-approved agencies can offer counseling for HUD programs, and the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act to regulate high-cost mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits lenders from offering high-cost mortgages to borrowers until they have received counseling from a HUD-approved housing counselor."
