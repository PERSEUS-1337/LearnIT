    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, with coverage options including individual, family, and self plus one plans. Participation is voluntary, with about 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Plans fall into fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs) categories, with shared premiums between the government and individuals. All plans cover basic services like hospital and physician care, with varying cost sharing through deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established parameters for eligibility, coverage election, types of health plans, and government's share of premiums for federal employees. Prior to FEHBA, federal employees had limited options for health insurance, with some purchasing coverage voluntarily or through union plans. President Truman's Commission recommended federal health insurance in 1951, leading to the creation of FEHBA in 1959. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established program expenses funding, OPM's role, and insurer contracting authority. FEHBA has been amended multiple times, with changes in premium cost-sharing, eligibility, and benefits expansion. Congress plays a role in modifying FEHB, with policymakers and researchers showing interest in the program. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB) has been a model for both private and public health insurance programs. It allows enrollees to choose from competing insurers with minimal intervention, promoting cost-conscious choices and controlling overall costs. Researchers have explored exporting aspects of FEHB to other programs like Medicare, expanding access to non-federal individuals, and creating new programs based on FEHB. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to expand FEHB eligibility or create new programs. Lessons from FEHB have also been considered for state-level health insurance exchanges. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB) has been influential in shaping health insurance exchanges. Lessons learned from FEHB have been considered for the Affordable Care Act. Congressional policymakers play a role in ensuring FEHB's viability and sustainability. Congress has financial interest in FEHB and the authority to make changes to the program. The report aims to explain FEHB's evolution and Congress's past interactions with the program. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with Congress enacting laws that place conditions on the use of federal funds for the program. For example, in 1983, a law prohibited using federal funds for abortions except in cases of danger to the woman's life. This provision has been renewed with some changes annually, except in 1994 and 1995. Subsequent appropriations bills have included this provision each year. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with Congress enacting laws that place conditions on the use of federal funds for the program. In 1971, the \"big six\" formula was created, setting the government's share at 40% of the simple average of the big six premiums, which increased to 50% in 1974. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Eligible participants include current federal employees, retirees, and their family members. Since its enactment, eligibility for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees became eligible, followed by certain temporary workers in 1988. Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) was also authorized in 1988, allowing separated employees to continue FEHB coverage for up to 18 months. TCC enrollees must pay the full premium and a 2% administrative fee. Children aging out of their parents' plans may have coverage for up to 36 months. Initially established five years before Medicare, there was little interaction between the programs in the early years. In 1982, Congress passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (P.L. 97-248), allowing federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal employees and retirees, outlining eligibility, benefits, premiums, and OPM's role. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 established the FEHB program for federal employees and retirees. Retirees who retired after July 1, 1960, with at least 12 years of service or for a disability were eligible, along with their family members. OPM could contract or approve different types of health benefit plans to participate in FEHB. The FEHB program was established in 1959 for federal employees and retirees, including those who retired after July 1, 1960. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans depended on the type of plan and enrollee, with specific biweekly government shares for different coverage types. The FEHB program, established in 1959, provided government shares of premiums for federal employees and retirees based on plan type and enrollee. The Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 and To Amend the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 expanded coverage and extended deadlines for applications from qualified employee organizations. P.L. 88-284, passed on March 17, 1964, removed the requirement for employee organizations to offer health care benefits before applying for FEHB. It expanded coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. The act also allowed retirees to continue FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964. OPM was given authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. Premium shares were made equal for all enrollees, regardless of gender. The act changed the government's share of premiums for employee organization plans and comprehensive medical plans, making the share of the premium the same for all enrollees, regardless of gender. P.L. 88-531 authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners and their dependents if the Civil Service Retirement Act applies to the commissioners. P.L. 88-631, P.L. 89-379, and P.L. 89-504 extended FEHB coverage to teachers in DC, congressional employees with fellowships, and amended FEHB to change government share of premiums and extend coverage for dependent children. FEHB coverage was extended to dependent children up to age 22. National Guard technicians became eligible for FEHB coverage in 1969. Full-time United States magistrates and their assistants were granted FEHB coverage in 1968. Federal employees were given the option to continue FEHB during transfer to international organizations in 1969. Government contribution to health benefits insurance was adjusted in 1970 to reflect medical price inflation. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program underwent changes in the 1970s, including adjustments to the government's contribution to reflect medical price inflation. The \"big six\" formula was established in 1971, determining the government's share at 40% of the average of six benefit plans. Additionally, FEHB coverage was extended to noncitizen employees in the Panama Canal Zone and family members of deceased employees with less than five years of service. In the 1970s, changes were made to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. P.L. 93-160 extended FEHB coverage to eligible U.S. nationals employed by the federal government outside the U.S. and Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-246 increased the government's share of the FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50% of the average of the big six premiums in 1974. The government's share of FEHB plan premiums was increased to 60% of the big six average premiums in 1975, with a maximum limit of 75%. Health insurance plans in FEHB had to comply with OPM decisions on health benefits disputes. P.L. 93-363 allowed direct access to clinical psychologists and optometrists without referral, with payment for services provided. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 allowed the government's share of health plan premiums for retirees to be available until expended. P.L. 94-342 restored eligibility for health benefits coverage to surviving spouses whose annuities were restored after termination due to remarriage. P.L. 95-368 established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage. It defined part-time career employment as consisting of a 16 to 32-hour work week, excluding temporary or intermittent employment. The act also made changes to the appeals process for employee organizations seeking to sponsor a health benefit plan. P.L. 95-583 reduced the required years of service for FEHB coverage in retirement from 12 to 5 years. P.L. 96-54 redefined employee for FEHB coverage purposes, excluding United States commissioners. P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage. P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage, excluding non-citizens stationed outside the US. P.L. 96-179 amended survivor benefits and dependency requirements for FEHB coverage. P.L. 97-248 required federal employees to pay Medicare tax starting January 1, 1983. The Insurance tax act enabled federal employees to count their federal employment towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. It also made Medicare payments secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. P.L. 97-346 required OPM to adjust government contributions for health plan premiums based on employee organizations. The government paid the difference into contingency reserves of FEHB plans in 1983. P.L. 98-151 prohibited funds from being used for abortions in FEHB plans, except in cases where the woman's life is endangered. P.L. 98-615 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, who must pay both the employee's and government's share of the premium. P.L. 99-53 authorized additional employee organization plans in FEHB if applied within 90 days of enactment. It allowed certain disability annuitants to enroll in an FEHB plan if previously enrolled. P.L. 99-251 introduced mixed model prepayment plans in FEHB and eliminated certain requirements. P.L. 99-251 expanded FEHB contracting authority to include health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors, as well as clinical social workers. It also emphasized the importance of adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction for FEHB enrollees. Additionally, the act allowed OPM to waive the five-year service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement under exceptional circumstances and mandated a study on the adequacy of FEHB information materials. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) required OPM to set minimum financial reserves for health plan carriers. Any excess reserves were to be returned to the Employees Health Benefits Fund. Starting October 1, 1986, USPS had to pay the government's share of health plan premiums for retired postal employees.

It would have required OPM to reduce rates for Medicare-eligible retirees in FEHB and specified the reduction based on estimated medical costs. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) required OPM to report to Congress on changes needed for health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals and to adopt NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental plans under FEHB. It also allowed OPM to impose sanctions on providers convicted of illegal activities related to healthcare.

It raised penalties for nonqualified HSA withdrawals and lowered HCFSA contributions. Eligible Indian tribes can purchase FEHB for tribal employees. The ACA required tribes to pay the government's share of employee health insurance premiums. It imposed administrative requirements on employers, including reporting coverage costs on W-2 forms. Insurers and employers had to report coverage details to the Secretary of HHS. Only ACA-created health plans or exchange-offered plans are available to Members of Congress and certain staff. Beginning January 1, 2014, Members and designated congressional staff could no longer purchase FEHB plans as active employees but could enroll in health plans offered through a SHOP exchange with an employer contribution. Those eligible for retirement could enroll in an FEHB plan upon retirement. The ACA imposed fees on health insurance plans, including an annual fee based on market share and a PCORI fee on insurers. A 40% excise tax on health insurers and plan administrators will be imposed starting in 2018. Starting in 2018, a 40% excise tax will be imposed on health insurers and plan administrators for coverage exceeding certain thresholds. This includes employer and employee premium payments for health insurance, dental and vision coverage premiums, and payments towards health-related accounts. The thresholds are $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, indexed to inflation. Any amount exceeding these thresholds will be subject to the tax. Additionally, the ACA requires the Director of OPM to offer at least two multistate plans through each exchange in each state. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) allows FEHB enrollees to choose \"self plus one\" coverage. The government will determine the premium share for self plus one based on the weighted average premium of all FEHB plans. The Director of OPM can establish separate units for MSP administration without reducing resources for FEHB. FEHB plans are not required to offer MSPs. OPM will determine the weighted average premium for self plus one coverage based on an actuarial analysis."
