    "content": "P.L. 106-554, signed in December 2000, enacted the Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government Appropriations, 2001. It provided funding for various accounts, including the General Services Administration for transition administration and the Executive Residence for White House family transfers. P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) partially funded select accounts from the primary funding measure. Various measures were considered before enacting P.L. 106-554 for FY2001 appropriations. The key details provided include House bill H.R. 4871, Senate bill S. 2900, Legislative Branch Appropriation H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985, Transportation Appropriations P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475), FY2001 Continuing Funding Resolution P.L. 106-275, and The Act P.L. 106-554 (H.R. 5658). The President submits the Budget of the United States Government annually to Congress. The United States Government submitted the budget for FY2001 on February 7, 2000. Congress establishes a procedure to pass a concurrent resolution setting budgetary levels for future years. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocate discretionary funding levels to subcommittees, including Treasury and General Government appropriations. This funding covers various law enforcement organizations under the Department of the Treasury, such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, Secret Service, and others. The U.S. Postal Service is mostly self-supporting, with limited federal contributions to the Postal Service Fund. Federal contributions are limited to payments to the Postal Service Fund to compensate for revenues foregone, such as free postal service for the blind. Appropriations for the Executive Office of the President provide salaries and expenses for various agencies within the EOP, including the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Security Council. Funding for drug control initiatives is distributed by the ONDCP to other entities. Independent agencies funded through this appropriation include the Federal Election Commission, the General Services Administration, and the National Archives and Records Administration. The Treasury and General Government appropriation includes restrictions that apply governmentwide. The curr_chunk discusses standard language in government appropriations that apply restrictions and authorize defined actions, such as prohibiting the use of funds for non-U.S. citizens, maintaining drug-free workplaces, and paying travel expenses for federal employees' immediate family members. It also mentions a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds. The Office of Management and Budget is required to report on the implementation of the rescission in the FY2002 budget. The Office of Management Budget issued guidelines for the implementation of a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations. The rescission applies to all net positive discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations, including advance appropriations for FY 2001 provided in FY 2000 or earlier years. Discretionary emergency appropriations are also subject to the rescission, with a requirement for a 0.22% reduction to be applied equally to each program, project, and activity. Each program, project, and activity must be reduced by 0.22% without discretion to change the allocation. The rescission of 0.22% must be applied to discretionary PPA, with reductions made on a pro-rata basis to every program, project, and activity. Agencies will receive their specific rescission amounts from OMB. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a 0.38% across-the-board rescission, with OMB reporting specific reductions in accounts. Each department had flexibility to protect high-priority programs while achieving the required savings. The FY2001 rescission provisions exempt certain programs, but are universally applied otherwise. The FY2000 Supplemental funding provisions are included in the FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act. The pay date for federal civilian personnel will revert to the original scheduled date in FY2000, altering the funding levels. Table 4 provides summary information for FY2000 enacted funding and FY2001 enacted funding. The FY2000 enacted funding levels and legislative measures for FY2001 Treasury and General Government appropriations are summarized in the table. Various bills were passed or debated in Congress, including H.R. 4871, S. 2900, H.R. 4985, P.L. 106-346, and P.L. 106-554. Hearings and markup sessions were held by the House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government. The Subcommittee markup for H.R. 4871 was on July 11, with the full Appropriations Committee reporting the bill on July 18. The House passed H.R. 4871 on July 20 by a vote of 216-202. The Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government held hearings in February, March, and April, sending the bill to the full committee on July 19. Cloture was invoked on July 26 with a vote of 97-0, and debate on H.R. 4871 was pending before the Senate adjourned on July 27. On July 26, 2000, H.R. 4985 was introduced by Jim Kolbe for Treasury Department appropriations. The House agreed to the rule for the Legislative Branch FY2001 appropriations bill on July 27. On September 14, 2000, the House approved the conference report for H.R. 4516, but the Senate rejected it on September 20. The Senate rejected the conference report on October 20 by a vote of 28 to 69. On October 12, the Senate agreed to the conference report by a vote of 58 to 37. The bill was vetoed by the President on October 30. The House recommitted the bill and veto message to the House Committee on Appropriations on October 31. Funding for FY2001 accounts was mostly at FY2000 levels through continuing resolutions. New accounts had no funding from October 1 to December 21, 2000, except for the General Services Administration account for the presidential transition. The White House was authorized to use funds for transition preparations through continuing resolutions. The Transportation FY2001appropriation, H.R. 4475, reached agreement on October 5, with the conference committee filing a report. Both the House and Senate agreed to the conference language on October 6. P.L. 106-346 was signed by the President on October 23, 2000. P.L. 106-554 enacts H.R. 5658, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations, FY 2001, through reference. H.R. 5658 was introduced as a new bill with funding levels identical to H.R. 4985. Table 1 shows the status of FY2001 Appropriations for various government accounts. The Department of the Treasury has financial and law enforcement functions carried out by various agencies. The IRS is the largest account within the department's appropriation, with funding totaling $8.86 billion for FY2001. The Department of Treasury's FY2001 funding is $13.89 billion, with $8.86 billion allocated for the IRS. A .22% rescission would result in a $30 million reduction. The budget request for FY2001 is $14.520 billion, with proposed increases for department-wide systems, Money Laundering Strategy, interagency crime and drug enforcement, and funding cuts for the Violent Crime Reduction Program. The House Appropriations committee reported H.R. 4871, providing $13.225 billion for the department. The Office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration received $950,000 for a pilot project to detect radioactive materials in imported scrap metal. An additional $25 million was allocated for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program by reducing the IRS Processing Assistance and Management Account. The Department of Treasury received a total of $13.161 billion under S. 2900, while the vetoed Legislative Branch conference agreement would have funded the Department at $13.598 billion. Several Department of Treasury accounts received additional funding through the Department of Transportation funding bill, including $6.4 million for a new National Terrorist Asset Tracking Center. The Department is directed to establish a centralized vehicle acquisition program before further funding is provided. The Department of Treasury received additional funding for various programs, including $15 million for the Integrated Treasury Wireless Network, $8 million for Expanded Access to Financial Services, and $5 million for a metropolitan area law enforcement training center. Additionally, $25 million was allocated for the design and construction of the training center. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and U.S. Secret Service also received funding for various purposes. The ATF, a law enforcement agency under the Department of Treasury, regulates alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. Its mission focuses on reducing crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. Congress has increased ATF's funding over the years, with $772,843,000 allocated for FY2001. Additionally, Congress provided funds for counter-terrorism efforts. The ATF's budget for FY2001 was allocated $772,843,000, with different amounts proposed by the House, Senate, and administration. The administration requested funding for various initiatives like the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy and Youth Crime Gun Interdiction. Congress provided additional funding for the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy to support local firearm initiatives. The FBI is reviewing referrals where prohibited persons obtained firearms after delayed denials, investigating multiple attempts by prohibited persons to purchase firearms, and checking federal firearm licensees' records for compliance. Congress allocated $19,078,000 to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative to 12 more cities, aiming to reduce youth firearm violence and trafficking. Congress provided funding for various initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence and enhancing law enforcement efforts. This includes funding for the Gang Resistance Education and Training program, the Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative, and the Expanded Ballistics Identification Initiative. Additionally, a memorandum of understanding was signed between ATF and FBI to further develop the Integrated Ballistics Identification System. The ATF and FBI operated incompatible systems for ballistics evidence from 1993 to 1997. Congress funded initiatives for law enforcement but did not fund the Tobacco Compliance/Diversion initiative. Controversial activities of the ATF include regulating firearms commerce. Legislation aimed to prevent preferences in firearm acquisition based on agreements with federal agencies. The Smith & Wesson Corporation entered into an agreement with HUD for safer guns. 411 governments joined the coalition but the language was not included in the enacted legislation. The U.S. Customs Service collected billions in trade-related duties and Congress increased appropriations for the agency. The U.S. Customs Service received increased appropriations from Congress for FY2001, totaling $2,281,327,000, representing an 18% increase over the previous year. Additional funding was allocated for counter-terrorism and air and marine interdiction accounts, but fell short of the Administration's request. Congress also provided funds for the modernization of Customs' automated systems. The U.S. Customs Service received increased appropriations for FY2001, totaling $2,281,327,000, with additional funding for counter-terrorism and air and marine interdiction accounts. Congress also provided funds for the modernization of Customs' automated systems, including specific budget enhancements for drug investigations, narcotics illicit proceeds strategy, forced child labor, and other initiatives. The U.S. Customs Service received increased appropriations for FY2001, totaling $2,281,327,000, with additional funding for counter-terrorism and air and marine interdiction accounts. Congress also provided funds for the modernization of Customs' automated systems, including specific budget enhancements for drug investigations, narcotics illicit proceeds strategy, forced child labor, and other initiatives. The vetoed conference agreement included earmarks for various initiatives such as Southwest border security, vehicle replacement, money laundering, and drug investigations. Customs' Automated Commercial System (ACS) has been inadequate in recent years. The U.S. Customs Service has struggled with the outdated Automated Commercial System (ACS) for handling imports, leading to \"brownouts\" that hinder international commerce. Despite funding for upgrading ACS and developing the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), Customs has faced challenges. Congress directed Customs to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE, but the report was delivered late. The Administration requested $338 million for automation modernization in FY2001, including a new user fee proposal to offset ACE developmental costs. In FY2000, Congress provided over $258 million in direct appropriations for the development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), including $5 million for the International Trade Data System (ITDS). The total cost of ACE over 7 years is estimated to be between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. Customs has taken steps to implement recommendations to improve efficiency and revenue collection. Customs generates offsetting receipts from two user fee programs established by various acts. COBRA fee receipts have increased significantly from FY1992 to FY2000, providing substantial funding for Customs. These receipts have limitations on their use and are primarily used for overtime costs and funding recurring expenses. Surplus revenues can be carried over to the next year for additional funding. Customs relies on COBRA fee receipts to fund positions and equipment, but there has been a recent drop in air passenger processing fee receipts. This reliance on COBRA fees may lead to issues in the coming year, especially with the authorization for the fees expiring at the end of FY2003. The IRS budget for FY2001 saw a 9.36% increase to maintain operations and modernization efforts. IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti testified that additional staffing is needed for enforcement and customer service, particularly for a new computer system. H.R. 4871 would fund IRS programs at $8.453 billion, with amendments reducing funding for certain accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed funding at $8.535 billion, higher than the House version. The Senate would fund IRS accounts at levels higher than the House. P.L. 106-554 funds IRS accounts at $8.639 million, with Processing, Assistance, and Management receiving $3,567.0 million, Tax Law Enforcement at $3,382.4 million, and Information Systems at $1,545 million. FY2001 IRS funding was a major point of objection in the Legislative Branch Appropriations. The President signed P.L. 106-346 for partial funding in the Treasury/General Government bill but subsequently vetoed the Legislative Branch Appropriations. The IRS supplemental provisions include delaying the implementation of a no-cost Internet tax filing service, allocating $7.974 million for Tax Law Enforcement, $71.751 million for Information Technology Investments, and $141 million for Staff Tax Administration for Balance and Equity. The STABLE initiative aims to improve taxpayer service and statutory mandates through staff increases, particularly in the Tax Law Enforcement account. The STABLE initiative aims to place additional staff in auditing, enforcement, and customer relations at the IRS. H.R. 4985 does not provide funding for this initiative, but the Tax Law Enforcement account will be fully funded to maintain current service levels. The President requested $829.5 million for the Secret Service in FY2001, with $824.5 million for salaries and expenses and $5 million for acquisition and construction costs. The FY2000 net funding for the Secret Service was $691.5 million, with a rescission of $738,000. P.L. 106-554 funds the Secret Service salaries and expenses account at $823.8 million and the acquisitions account at $8.941 million. The Secret Service salaries and expenses account is funded at $8.941 million, including $3.920 million for security enhancements at the Vice President's residence. Additional funding of $2.9 million is provided for 21 agents to participate in Joint Terrorism Task Forces. $2 million is allocated for forensic support of investigations of missing and exploited children. H.R. 4871 would have funded the salaries and expenses account at $823.8 million, $156.5 million above FY2000, and $700,000 below the President's budget request. It includes $36,266,000 for activities previously funded elsewhere and $1,767,000 for the National Threat Assessment Center. Additionally, $24.2 million is allocated for additional protective requirements during the Presidential election and transition period. During the Presidential election and transition period, funding for the Secret Service salaries and expenses account was a key issue. The vetoed conference agreement would have funded the account at $778.3 million, while the President's request and H.R. 4871 proposed funding it at $5 million. The U.S. Postal Service generates funding through product sales and services, with an appropriation from the federal government for revenue foregone on free and reduced rate mail. The President requested $96.1 million for payment to the Postal Service Fund, with $67.1 million delayed until October 1, 2001. The funding for revenue foregone in FY2000 was initially set at $93.4 million, but was reduced to $93.1 million due to a .38% cut. For FY2001, P.L. 106-554 allocated $29 million with an advance appropriation of $67.1 million for FY2002. The vetoed measure would have provided $96.1 million, with $67.1 million for FY2002 and $29 million for FY2001. The Postal Service must use appropriated funds for guards, with similar powers as special policemen. Most offices in the Executive Office of the President are funded by the Treasury and General Government appropriations act, except for three offices. The President's FY2001 budget proposed $702,245,000 for the EOP, a 7.3% increase from FY2000. The FY2001 appropriation request for the Executive Office of the President (EOP) is $702,245,000, a 7.3% increase from FY2000. Almost 70% of these funds would be for accounts in the Office of National Drug Control Policy and Federal Drug Control Programs, with $474,900,000 allocated for transfer accounts. The President's compensation sees a 56% increase to $390,000, including an expense allowance of $50,000. The White House Office receives an appropriation of $53,288,000 for salaries. The FY2001 budget proposal for the White House Office includes an appropriation of $53,288,000 for salaries and expenses, a 2% increase from FY2000. H.R. 4871 would have provided $52,135,000, $1,153,000 below the President's request. The House denied requests for various expenses but approved a transfer of $500,000 for upgrading the web page. The Executive Residence received $10,900,000 for operating expenses, a 17.7% increase from FY2000.

S. 2900 and H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would have funded accounts at requested levels, with limitations on repairs and restoration funding. The repairs and restoration funding includes design and replacement of the concrete raceway containing communication lines. The Executive Residence at the White House is authorized to make expenditures for transition and moving expenses after the 2000 election. Maintenance and repair costs are funded by the National Park Service, while entertainment costs for state functions are funded by the Department of State. Reimbursable political events must be paid for in advance by the sponsor, with the President's political party required to deposit $25,000 for related expenses. The Act mandates separate accounting for reimbursements and billing of sponsoring organizations. Staff of the Executive Residence must report to the Committees on Appropriations after each fiscal year. The Executive Residence is required to report to the Committees on Appropriations after each fiscal year and maintain a tracking system for reimbursable expenses. The budget proposes $3,673,000 for salaries and expenses, a 1.5% increase from FY2000, and $354,000 for the Official Residence of the Vice President, a 2.6% increase. Different bills proposed varying funding levels, with P.L. 106-554 appropriating $4,110,000 for the Council of Economic Advisers, a 7% increase from FY2000. The FY2001 budget proposed and P.L. 106-554 appropriated $4,032,000 for the Office of Policy Development, the same as FY2000. The House approved $4,030,000, denying a $2,000 request for increased travel expenses.

On October 5, the conference report for H.R. 4475 was filed, and on October 6, it was brought up for a vote, which passed 344-50. The conference report for H.R. 4475 was agreed to by the House with a vote of 344-50 and by the Senate with a vote of 78-10. The President signed P.L. 106-346 on October 23, 2000, which funds government programs not covered by regular FY2001 appropriations. Most programs are funded at FY2000 levels, with new programs in FY2001 receiving no funding. Multiple continuing funding resolutions were passed, including one specifically for the General Services Administration to administer the presidential transition. The House and Senate agreed to H.J.Res. 125, which extends funding and authorizes expenditures for the White House transition after the 2000 election. The inclusion of funding provisions in the legislative branch appropriations caught many by surprise, with no minority signatures on the conference report. The debate focused more on protocol than on the substance of the provisions. The House and Senate debated the conference report on H.R. 4985, with objections raised over procedural protocol and funding levels for IRS accounts and courthouse construction. The possibility of a veto was suggested by administration representatives and Democratic Members. The conference version of the H.R. 4516 report differs from the House and Senate versions in funding levels for various accounts. The total funding would be $30,309.5 million, lower than the FY2001 request of $31,208.4 million. Some accounts would exceed the President's request and both House and Senate versions, while others would be equal to or lower than either. The conference version of H.R. 4516 report would have exceeded the House and Senate versions but matched the President's request in most cases. There are 26 accounts where the funding level would have exceeded either the House or Senate proposals. Additionally, there are eight accounts where the conference funding level aligns with the President's request and both congressional versions. Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government provisions aims to improve data quality by issuing guidelines for federal agencies to ensure information integrity. The curr_chunk discusses guidelines for federal agencies to ensure the quality and integrity of information, including statistical information. It also mentions the requirement for agencies to establish mechanisms for correcting inaccurate information and report complaints to the OMB director. Additionally, it notes that the repeal of the telephone excise tax is not part of the Treasury and General Government text. The President vetoed H.R. 4516, sending FY2001 funding for the legislative branch and Treasury back to Congress. He cited unfinished business and prioritizing funding for classrooms, schools, and workers. The House referred the veto to the Committee on Appropriations. Reports of a congressional pay raise veto were not mentioned in the President's statement, as H.R. 4516 does not include provisions for a pay raise. Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990, federal white-collar employees are to receive pay adjustments. White collar employees under the General Schedule receive annual adjustments based on two mechanisms: base pay adjustment and locality-based payments. The base pay adjustment for January 2001 is 2.7%, with no proposed changes. The second tier adjustment is 1%, based on a budget recommendation of 3.7%. Locality-based payments are calculated using surveys of specific localities in the US. President Clinton vetoed FY2001 funding for the legislative branch and Treasury, prioritizing funding for education and workers. President Clinton proposed a 1% locality payment for federal blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System. Congress has limited wage adjustments based on General Schedule rates, with high-cost area wages capped. Pay adjustments for federal officials are governed by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 governs pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, based on ECI calculations. In January 2001, a 3% pay adjustment was dictated by ECI calculations, but it is limited to the rate of adjustment for the General Schedule, which was 2.7%. Despite reports of President Clinton vetoing a bill to eliminate a pay raise for Members of Congress, the raise would still go into effect as neither the vetoed bill nor P.L.106-554 addressed the issue. The annual pay increase for judges must be specifically authorized, as stated in P.L. 106-554. The incoming President will receive a salary of $400,000 per annum, as per the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000. Section 630 of H.R. 5658, enacted through P.L. 106-554, requires health insurance plans in the FEHBP to cover prescription contraceptives, with exemptions for certain organizations based on religious beliefs. The FY2001 act prohibits discrimination against individuals who refuse to provide contraceptives due to religious beliefs. S. 2900 and H.R. 5658 contain similar provisions exempting certain plans from covering prescription contraceptives. Section 509 of H.R. 5658 prohibits funds for abortions under FEHBP, with exceptions for endangerment to the mother's health or rape-induced pregnancies. Section 513 exempts FEHBP contracts from cost accounting standards. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated a temporary increase in employee retirement contributions. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated a temporary increase in employee retirement contributions under CSRS and FERS, phased in over 3 years. Employee contributions increased by 0.25% in 1999, 0.15% in 2000, and were scheduled to rise by another 0.1% in 2001. The higher contributions did not increase benefit accruals. A legislative initiative to repeal the increase was proposed in FY2001, and two bills were introduced in Congress for that purpose. The higher contribution rates were repealed for all federal employees except Members of Congress by the FY2001 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act. The Washington Airports Authority is eligible for retirement benefits as law enforcement officers under CSRS or FERS. They can receive a retirement annuity at age 50 with 20 years of service. Law enforcement officers must retire at age 57 or after 20 years of service. They contribute an additional 0.5% of pay to their retirement plans. The Thrift Savings Plan allows federal employees to contribute up to 10% of pay or the maximum deferral permissible under section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) allows federal employees covered by CSRS or FERS to contribute a percentage of their pay, with limits set by the Internal Revenue Code. The maximum allowable employee contribution to the TSP will increase annually until reaching 15% for FERS and 10% for CSRS by fiscal year 2005. After fiscal year 2006, percentage-of-pay limits on TSP contributions will be eliminated, and employees will be subject to contribution limits under IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g). Section 633 of H.R. 5658, enacted through P.L. 106-554, continues provisions for child care in federal facilities. Section 643 from H.R. 4871 requires background checks for employees at federally-provided day care facilities. H.R. 4871 also allows executive branch agencies to use funds for child care services for lower income federal employees. The bill stipulated that payments to licensed child care providers would be made in advance, covering agreed upon periods. An amendment required background checks for workers in federal child care centers. The Senate's bill included provisions for improving affordability of child care for lower income federal employees but did not include the timing of payments or background check requirements. The conference version of the bill (H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985) included provisions for improving federal child care affordability and requiring background checks for child care workers. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved allocations for budget authority and outlays, with discrepancies between the two chambers and lower funding than requested. The administration had requested $14.678 billion in discretionary funding. H.R. 5658, funded Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government accounts at $30.31 billion through P.L. 106-554. Mandatory accounts received $14.68 billion, discretionary accounts $15.63 billion. P.L. 106-346 provided $348 million supplemental funding.

Funding information for various appropriations acts is provided, including H.R. 5658 which funded Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government accounts. Total funding requested and calculated by CBO is also mentioned. The funding details for Department of the Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government Appropriations for FY2001 are provided in the conference report on H.R. 5658. The totals include funding reductions due to a rescission required by P.L. 106-113. Title V of P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) provides partial funding for selected accounts under the Treasury and General Government appropriation legislation. P.L. 106-520 (H.J.Res. 125) authorizes funds for moving families to and from the White House, estimated at $200,000. Definitions from the \"Glossary of Budgetary Terms\" are provided, including Account, Appropriation, and Authorization. Authorization in substantive law allows for appropriations for programs or agencies. Budget Authority is provided by law for obligations leading to outlays, including appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. A Budget Resolution is a concurrent resolution by Congress setting the budget for at least the next five fiscal years. A Continuing Resolution provides budget authority to agencies when regular appropriations are not enacted. Direct Spending involves budget authority and resulting outlays. Direct spending is budget authority provided in laws other than annual appropriations acts, classified as mandatory spending. It is subject to PAGO rules and includes appropriated entitlements. Discretionary spending, on the other hand, is budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts excluding appropriated entitlements. Federal funds encompass all government monies except trust funds. Obligations are binding agreements requiring payment, while outlays are payments made to fulfill obligations. The PAGO process ensures revenue and direct spending alignment. The Budget Enforcement Act established PAGO to prevent deficit increases or surplus reductions from revenue and direct spending legislation. PAGO enforces offsetting measures for any deficit increase. The Reconciliation Process aligns tax and spending levels with budget resolutions. Revolving Funds use income for operations without fiscal year limits. Scorekeeping tracks budgetary actions, and Supplemental Appropriations provide additional budget authority. Supplemental appropriations acts provide additional budget authority beyond regular appropriations. Trust funds are designated for specific purposes, while user fees are charged for government services.
