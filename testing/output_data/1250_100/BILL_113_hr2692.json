    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013\". Pollination services are crucial for agricultural production, valued globally at over $125 billion and $20-30 billion annually in the United States. One-third of North American food relies on honey bee pollination, including 95 types of fruits. Colony collapse disorder has been increasing, with beekeepers losing entire operations. Beekeepers in the US lost 45.1% of colonies in the winter of 2012-2013. Current honey bee colony survivorship is too low to meet US agricultural pollination needs. The use of neonicotinoid insecticides is linked to the decline of pollinators. Neonicotinoid insecticides are linked to the rapid decline of pollinators and their health. These insecticides cause various harmful effects such as impaired foraging, weakened immunity, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Studies have shown both sublethal and lethal effects from neonicotinoid application. For example, a single corn kernel coated with neonicotinoid can be toxic enough to kill a songbird. The European Union suspended the use of neonicotinoids on agricultural crops due to their unacceptable hazards to bees. SEC. 3. URGENT REGULATORY RESPONSE FOR HONEY BEE AND POLLINATOR PROTECTION. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must suspend the registration of certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee-attractive plants until it is determined they will not harm pollinators. This includes evaluating scientific evidence and conducting field studies on the effects of these insecticides on pollinators. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will not issue new registrations for certain pesticides on bee-attractive plants until a determination is made to protect pollinators. The Secretary of the Interior will monitor native bees for long-term protection. The Environmental Protection Agency will monitor the health and population status of native bees to protect pollinators of agricultural and non-agricultural plants. They will identify causes of unusual bee mortality and submit annual reports to Congress and the public."
