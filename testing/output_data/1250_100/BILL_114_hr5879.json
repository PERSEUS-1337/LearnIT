    "content": "MODIFICATIONS OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCTION FROM ADVANCED NUCLEAR POWER FACILITIES. The amendment to Section 45J(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes the allocation of unutilized national megawatt capacity limitation by the Secretary. This allocation is to be done rapidly after December 31, 2020, first to facilities placed in service before that date and then to facilities placed in service after that date. The term 'unutilized national megawatt capacity limitation' refers to the excess of 6,000 megawatts over the total capacity allocated by the Secretary before January 1, 2021, minus any allocation to facilities not in service by that date. This allocation is treated similarly to national megawatt capacity limitation, and certain provisions do not apply to facilities receiving this allocation. The amendment allows qualified public entities to transfer tax credits to eligible project partners for eligible projects. The eligible project partner will be treated as the taxpayer for the credit. Qualified public entity includes government entities, mutual or cooperative electric companies, and not-for-profit electric utilities that received a loan under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. Eligible project partners are individuals involved in designing or constructing advanced nuclear power facilities eligible for the tax credit. The tax credit under subsection (a) applies to individuals involved in providing the nuclear steam supply system, nuclear fuel, or owning an advanced nuclear power facility. Special rules apply for partnerships where a qualified public entity is treated as the taxpayer for their share of the credit. The tax credit under subsection (a) applies to individuals involved in providing the nuclear steam supply system, nuclear fuel, or owning an advanced nuclear power facility. Special rules apply for partnerships where a qualified public entity is treated as the taxpayer for their share of the credit. The distributive share of the credit includes any partner of the partnership. The credit is taken into account in the first taxable year of the eligible project partner after the qualified public entity's taxable year. Any benefit derived by an eligible project partner from this election is not considered a private business use. Special rules apply for proceeds of transfers for mutual or cooperative electric companies under Section 501(c)(12). In the tax code, cooperative electric companies are affected by new amendments related to income treatment under specific sections. The effective dates for these changes vary, with one taking effect upon enactment and the other applying to taxable years after December 31, 2016."
