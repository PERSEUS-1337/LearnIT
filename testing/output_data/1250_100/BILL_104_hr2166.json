    "content": "The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" is introduced, which includes a minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations under Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" introduces a minimum tax on specific foreign and foreign-owned corporations under the Internal Revenue Code. This tax applies to corporations with substantial foreign-related person transactions, ensuring their taxable income meets a certain threshold based on profit percentages and gross receipts from different business activities. The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain foreign corporations with significant foreign-related transactions to ensure their taxable income meets specific thresholds. This tax applies when a qualified section 482 agreement is in effect with the corporation for a particular category of business activities. The agreement aims to reflect the corporation's taxable income accurately and may have retroactive effects. The Secretary may allow a qualified section 482 agreement to apply retroactively to prior taxable years. In cases where activities cannot be categorized, a minimum tax of 35 percent may be imposed on gross receipts from property sales. Additionally, waivers may be granted in cases of casualty or disaster. The Secretary may waive the application of certain tax provisions in cases of casualty or disaster. Taxable income is calculated without considering foreign taxes paid. The Secretary determines applicable profit percentages for different business activities based on domestic corporations' earnings rates. The earnings rate of domestic corporations for different business activities is based on the ratio of adjusted book income to gross receipts. Adjusted book income is income reported for financial purposes without deductions for certain taxes. Definitions and special rules include terms like '25-percent foreign-owned' and 'substantial foreign-related person transactions'. The corporation's substantial foreign-related person transactions are determined by the aggregate amount involved with foreign related parties exceeding $2,000,000 or 10% of gross income. Business activities are categorized by the Standard Industrial Classification Code. Effective Date: The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
