Marjory Stoneman Douglas, known for defining the Everglades ecosystem through her book \"The Everglades: River of Grass,\" dedicated her life to its defense against threats like drainage and development. She was honored with the Medal of Freedom in 1994 for her efforts. Ernest F. Coe was also a key figure in the creation of Everglades National Park. Ernest F. Coe, known as the \"Father of Everglades National Park,\" was a landscape architect who envisioned protecting south Florida's wildlife and habitats. His leadership led to the authorization of the park by Congress in 1934, and he finally realized his dream in 1947 after lobbying tirelessly and funding much of the work himself. The purpose of this section is to commemorate the vision and leadership of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Ernest F. Coe in protecting the Everglades and establishing Everglades National Park. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness is being redesignated to honor Mrs. Douglas's contributions to the park's establishment. The Secretary of the Interior will provide notification of this redesignation. The Interior will inform the public of the redesignation of the wilderness area through various means. Any reference to the \"Everglades Wilderness\" will now be considered as the \"Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness.\" The Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center will be designated as such to honor Mr. Coe's vision and leadership. The Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center will be renamed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Visitor Center to honor Mr. Coe's vision and leadership in establishing and protecting Everglades National Park. Additionally, a technical correction will change \"personnally-owned\" to \"personally-owned\" in the relevant section."
