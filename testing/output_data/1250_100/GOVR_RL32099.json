Evaluating the effects of permanent tax changes on capital allocation involves measuring the effective tax rate on returns to different assets. This report focuses on estimating the effects of these proposals on the effective tax rate on earnings and comparing tax rates across asset types, organizational forms, and sources of finance. The report discusses estimated effective tax rates on income from prospective investments, taking into account the timing of deductions and the value of money over time. These rates can differ significantly from average tax rates and can even be negative for new investments. The main factor affecting the tax burden on new investment is how quickly the cost of the asset is recovered through depreciation deductions. Effective tax rates on new investment impact the allocation and size of the capital stock. The effective tax rate on investment income is determined by the statutory rate and the present value of depreciation deductions. Inflation can increase effective tax rates, especially for shorter-lived investments. Equipment assets are deducted quickly, leading to lower effective tax rates compared to their actual lifespan. Buildings are deducted over a longer period, impacting the overall tax burden on new investments. Tax rates can be measured in various ways, including at the corporate level on equity financed investment. Effective corporate tax rates can also be measured as the total tax at both the corporate and personal level, reflecting the deductibility of interest and individual income taxes. Tax rates can be separated into total rates on debt and equity financed investment to examine the distortion favoring debt finance. Tax rates also impact dividend payout choices due to differential treatment of retained earnings. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to tax earnings from different capital investments more evenly. Before the act, effective tax rates on equipment assets were low, while rates on buildings were higher. Post-1986, equipment tax rates were close to the statutory rate, and building rates remained high. Oil and gas investments continued to receive favorable treatment. The goal of equal taxation is to ensure fair treatment in private markets. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to equalize taxation on different types of capital investments. However, over the years, legislative changes have reintroduced disparities in tax burdens, particularly favoring equipment investments through bonus depreciation. This has led to increased effective tax rates, especially for buildings, with the top corporate tax rate being raised in 1993. The 1993 legislation raised most tax rates by approximately one percentage point and increased the useful life for non-residential buildings. The decline in inflation rates favored equipment and shorter-lived assets, resulting in higher effective tax rates for buildings. The effective tax rates for equipment are lower than for buildings, with equipment taxed at an average of 26% compared to 32% for structures. Bonus depreciation can further reduce the tax rates for equipment, with 30% bonus depreciation lowering the rate to 20% and 50% bonus depreciation reducing it to 15%. Debt is favored at the corporate level due to interest deductions, while equity is favored at the individual level for capital gains tax treatment. At the individual level, equity is favored over debt due to lower capital gains tax rates, tax deferral until stock is sold, and potential tax exemption at death. Recent tax revisions have further lowered capital gains tax rates and extended lower rates to dividends, favoring equity investment. The tax treatment of debt vs. equity is complex, with factors like individual investment forms and tax-favored accounts affecting effective tax rates. The tax treatment of debt vs. equity is complex, with factors like individual investment forms and tax-favored accounts affecting effective tax rates. Table 3 presents estimated effective tax rates on debt and equity under various scenarios, showing that the debt-equity distortion has been reduced but remains small due to lower individual tax rates and bonus depreciation benefits. Comparing tax rates with large discrepancies, the tax wedge is a more meaningful comparison, measured by t/(1-t) where t is the tax rate. The tax treatment of debt vs. equity is complex, with factors like individual investment forms and tax-favored accounts affecting effective tax rates. The debt-equity distortion has been reduced but remains small due to lower individual tax rates and bonus depreciation benefits. The tax wedge is a more meaningful comparison, measured by t/(1-t) where t is the tax rate. The new rates reduce the difference between debt and equity returns, with a combined change of 15%. Pension and IRA considerations result in smaller differentials, with a minimal effect on the distortion between debt and equity. The corporate tax discourages investment in the corporate sector and creates a distortion between debt and equity. The analysis compares the total effective tax rate in the corporate sector with the non-corporate sector, considering individual tax rates for pensions and IRAs. The reduction in the tax differential between corporate and non-corporate investments is relatively small, regardless of bonus depreciation rules. The tax bill provided reductions for all forms of investments, benefiting corporate and non-corporate debt, equity, and business investment through bonus depreciation. The dividend relief provision lowers the tax rate on dividends to that of capital gains, narrowing the tax rate spread. The tax bill provides reductions for all forms of investments, benefiting corporate and non-corporate debt, equity, and business investment through bonus depreciation. The dividend relief provision lowers the tax rate on dividends to that of capital gains, narrowing the tax rate spread to about 15%. The effective tax rates for new investment need to consider various factors such as assets held in non-taxable accounts like pensions and IRAs, owner-occupied housing, and business inventories. Business inventories tend to be taxed at slightly higher rates, while owner-occupied housing is generally subject to a zero tax. The overall effective tax rate depends on individual tax rates and how much individuals are willing to substitute between savings within and outside the plans. Table 5 reports tax rates calculated two ways, one with individual tax rates and the other weighting tax burdens between tax favored and regular savings accounts. The effect of individual tax rates is about twice as large when no infra-marginal investment is in pensions, reducing the overall effective tax rate. With IRAs and pensions, tax rates are much lower, reducing effective tax rates on all capital by about 10% to 15%. Bonus depreciation has a similar effect regardless of the tax regime, reducing effective tax rates by 7% to 9% for 30% bonus depreciation and 13% to 19% for 50% bonus depreciation. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of rate reductions and 50% bonus depreciation on effective tax rates, with reductions of six to eight percentage points. It also mentions bills introduced to repeal the illegal Extraterritorial Income Tax provision and the effects of Chairman Thomas's 2003 bill, including provisions for shorter recovery periods for manufacturing equipment and an extension of bonus depreciation. The effects of shorter depreciation lives on manufacturing equipment are calculated, showing reductions in effective tax rates of about five percentage points under permanent law. The provision for bonus depreciation in H.R. 2896 would have increased differences between equipment and structures in manufacturing, favoring manufacturing overall. However, the overall effects on tax burdens are small as the provisions only cover a portion of equipment assets. Manufacturing equipment represents about a third of reproducible capital, resulting in an overall rate reduction of about 1.5 percentage points in the industry. With manufacturing assets accounting for 25% of the corporate capital stock, the overall corporate tax rate would fall by less than half a percentage point without bonus depreciation. The provisions in H.R. 2896 also included measures to lower effective tax rates for multinational corporations, but these do not apply to investment in manufacturing. The provisions in Senator Hatch's bill, S. 1495, and Representatives Crane and Rangel's bill, H.R. 1769, aimed to lower effective tax rates for corporations through measures like 100% expensing and a deduction for domestic production income. These provisions would have reduced tax burdens, especially for manufacturing assets, but were temporary extensions. The deduction for domestic production income would be multiplied by the share of total business that is domestic, resulting in lower effective tax rates for domestic earnings. Based on IRS data, controlled foreign corporations in manufacturing made up 82% of receipts and 87% of assets of American manufacturing corporations in 1998. The proposed rate cut in S. 1637 would lower the tax rate on manufacturing by 9% to around 32%, reducing effective tax rates on manufacturing structures and equipment. This would favor investment in domestic manufacturing and narrow the gap between equipment and structures, benefiting overall manufacturing plant and equipment investment. The proposed tax rate cut in S. 1637 would lower the tax rate on manufacturing by 9% to around 32%, benefiting overall manufacturing plant and equipment investment. The reduction in effective tax rate for manufacturing investment would be about 1.5 percentage points, similar to the depreciation provisions in the 2003 Thomas bill. Additionally, qualified production activities income is allowed a deduction from taxable income of 9%, limited to 50% of wages. The proposed tax rate cut in S. 1637 would benefit manufacturing plant and equipment investment by lowering the tax rate on manufacturing by 9% to around 32%. The law excludes certain services and property transactions, with the 50% wage limit excluding sole proprietorships with no wages paid. The Joint Tax Committee estimated that around a third of the benefit would go to corporations, with smaller incorporated firms, partnerships, and sole proprietorships also receiving a portion. The overall effect on the economy is projected to be around \u00bd of one percent. The effects of faster depreciation of equipment compared to a rate cut are similar in size and both benefit the manufacturing sector. The accelerated depreciation favors equipment over structures and does not address debt-equity distortion, while the rate cut reduces differences in tax rates across assets. The Crane-Rangel bill would encourage more investment in the US, but the depreciation provision is easier to administer and more cost-effective in reducing tax burdens. The 2003 House bill included provisions aimed at small businesses, such as a lower corporate tax rate and temporary increase in equipment investment deduction. These measures would encourage investment in small corporations and equipment for certain small businesses. The extension of expensing in the final legislation favors investment in equipment for small businesses, particularly those that are unincorporated. There are provisions to reduce taxes on income from foreign investments and address tax shelter issues. The bill also includes provisions on carryovers of losses, alternative minimum tax, and a temporary extension of the R&D tax credit. Overall, the bill is roughly revenue neutral and contains international provisions. The 2001-2003 temporary tax cuts have mixed effects on reducing distortions in capital income tax cuts. Capital income tax cuts reduce the distortion favoring consumption over investment, but may not increase saving. Debt-financed tax cuts could reduce the national savings rate. Dividend relief provision  is most consistent with economic efficiency in the allocation of business capital. Reducing individual tax rates favors debt finance and noncorporate investment, magnifying existing distortions. Bonus depreciation, if made permanent, expands favorable treatment of equipment investments over structures without reducing financial or sectoral distortions. The revisions in the bills addressing the ETI provision favor manufacturing and other eligible activities, particularly through equipment depreciation. However, the overall effects outside of that sector are minimal. Making temporary investment subsidies permanent may undermine government credibility and fiscal policy management in the future. Tax rate cuts, especially those limited to manufacturing, can create classification issues for firms engaging in multiple activities. These cuts may increase administrative costs and opportunities for tax sheltering. Calculations for tax rates involve determining the initial investment needed to break even after accounting for depreciation and after-tax returns. Eliminating tax payments and deductions, pre-tax discount rates are then used to sum the flows to the original investment. The effective tax rate is calculated by subtracting the after-tax rate of return from the pre-tax rate of return, divided by the pre-tax rate. Discounting involves dividing each cash flow by a discount factor based on the time it is earned. The formula for pre-tax return incorporates factors such as after-tax discount rate, economic depreciation rate, statutory tax rate, and inflation rate. The effective tax rate for equity at the firm level is determined by the difference between pre-tax return and after-tax discount rate. Individual level taxes and debt finance also impact the overall tax rate calculation. The after-tax real return on equity is calculated using various factors such as interest rate, dividend rate, growth rate, individual tax rate, and capital gains tax rate. Assumptions include a 7.5% interest rate, 2% inflation, and a 7% real return on equity before taxes. The methodology and data sources are detailed in [author name scrubbed], The Economic Effects of Taxing Capital Income. Tax rates on dividends and capital gains decrease, with half of corporate stock sold and half of financial assets held in tax-exempt forms. Data for analyzing the Crane-Rangel bill and U.S. corporations overall were sourced from specific publications."
