    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It allocates 55,000 visas annually to countries with lower immigrant admissions in the past five years, following the Immigration Act of 1990. The allocation formula is based on regional populations. The Diversity Visa Lottery, established in 1990, allocates 55,000 visas annually based on regional populations. Each country is limited to 7% of the visa limit. Recipients become legal permanent residents of the US. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act temporarily reduces the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas. In FY2002, 42,829 individuals were admitted as legal permanent residents through the Diversity Visa Lottery, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries sending diversity immigrants were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. These countries have consistently been among the top diversity visa senders, along with Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Morocco, Romania, and Russia. Ireland, Poland, and the former Soviet Union previously won the most visas in the mid-1990s, but their participation has declined. Albania and Nigeria have been the top sending countries, while Russia and Ukraine's numbers may be underestimated due to reporting issues. In FY2002, European and African immigrants received a significant percentage of diversity visas compared to family-based and employment-based immigrants. To be eligible for a diversity visa, applicants must meet education or work experience requirements and be from a qualified foreign state. Visa winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure eligibility for entry into the U.S. The FY2005 diversity lottery aimed to prevent visa ineligibility under various grounds, such as health, criminal history, and security concerns. The application period ran from November 1 to December 30, 2003, requiring electronic submissions for the first time. Certain countries with high immigration rates were ineligible, including Canada, China, India, and Mexico. In the FY2003 diversity visa lottery, over 2 million out of 8.7 million applications were disqualified for not following State Department instructions precisely. Aliens submitting multiple applications are disqualified, but spouses can submit separate entries. Derivative beneficiaries must be listed on the petition initially, and if the winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked. Winners are selected randomly by computer once all acceptable applications are received. The State Department selects winners randomly for the FY2005 diversity lottery. Winners will be notified between May and July 2004, with visas issued between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Winning does not guarantee a visa due to more applications than visas available. Applicants must act quickly to demonstrate admissibility. Interviews start in October 2004, with some questioning the lottery's continuation. Critics of the diversity visa argue that it favors immigrants from a few countries and suggest amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries. Supporters believe the policy should apply uniformly to all visa categories. There is debate over who should bear the costs of the lottery, with some suggesting a fee to enter. The diversity visa is criticized for being susceptible to fraud, but the State Department claims to be addressing these concerns."
