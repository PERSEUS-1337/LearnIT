    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014\". The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014 recommends developing a Governmentwide Federal energy policy updated regularly with strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews. The Department of Energy conducts a Quadrennial Technology Review to coordinate energy technology policies and programs. A Quadrennial Energy Review would establish national energy objectives, coordinate actions across Federal agencies, and identify necessary resources. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014 proposes establishing a Quadrennial Energy Review to identify resources for energy technologies, inform federal energy policy decisions, enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm. The review will involve input from Congress, the energy industry, academia, NGOs, and the public. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014 proposes establishing a Quadrennial Energy Review under Section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act to inform federal energy policy decisions and enhance energy security. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014 defines key terms such as Director, Federal Laboratory, Interagency Energy Coordination Council, and Quadrennial Energy Review. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013 establishes energy objectives and an interagency energy coordination council to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review. The council includes representatives from the Department of Energy, Commerce, Defense, and State. The Quadrennial Energy Review involves various federal departments and agencies, including State, Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Transportation, OMB, NSF, and EPA, as well as others deemed appropriate by the President. The review aims to provide an integrated view of national energy objectives and policies, aligning research programs, incentives, regulations, and partnerships. The President is required to submit a report on the Quadrennial Energy Review to Congress every four years, starting from August 1, 2015. The Quadrennial Energy Review involves federal departments and agencies to provide an integrated view of national energy objectives. Congress requires a report on the review, including objectives for Federal energy policy, anticipated actions, resource requirements, and analysis of roles of various parties in achieving these objectives. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes assessments of energy use sectors, technology requirements, policy options, energy storage, and involvement of Federal Laboratories in energy programs. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes portfolio assessments for resource deployment, mapping of research linkages, identification of demonstration projects and funding needs, assessment of global competitors, and identification of policy gaps for energy technology adoption. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to accelerate energy technology adoption through federal tax policies, federal agencies as early adopters, a priority list for implementation, analysis of policy intervention points, effective energy policy areas, and recommendations for executive branch organization changes. Interim reports may also be prepared and published as part of the review. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes an Executive Secretariat to provide necessary support and cooperation from federal agencies. This Act does not supersede any existing federal laws."
