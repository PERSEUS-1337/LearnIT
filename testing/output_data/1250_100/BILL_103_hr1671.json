    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independence Hall Commemorative Coin Act\" and includes Congressional findings. The Congress finds that it is the Federal Government's responsibility to preserve historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall, Old City Hall, and Independence Hall. Financial constraints have hindered the National Park Service's ability to provide necessary maintenance for these sites. In 1994, the United States will commemorate the National Park Service's adoption of responsibility for these historic landmarks. The Congress recognizes the importance of preserving historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall, Old City Hall, and Independence Hall. Financial constraints have hindered the National Park Service's maintenance efforts for these sites. Minting a United States coin to commemorate the ongoing preservation of these shrines is deemed appropriate. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue $1 coins with specific specifications and designs emblematic of liberty shrines. These coins will contain 90% silver and 10% copper, weigh 26.73 grams, and have a diameter of 1.500 inches. They will feature the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, with inscriptions including \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The Secretary will obtain silver for authorized coins from stockpiles. The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Advisory Committee. Coins will be sold. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.\n\nCoins authorized under section 3 will be sold by the Secretary at face value plus design and issuance costs, including a $7 surcharge per coin. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted. \n\nSEC. 7. ISSUANCE OF COINS. The Secretary may issue coins in uncirculated and proof qualities, starting on July 4, 1994, for a period of up to 1 year. No procurement laws apply to goods or services needed for this Act, except for equal employment opportunity laws. Surcharges will be distributed accordingly. SEC. 9. DISTRIBUTION OF SURCHARGES.\n\n50% of surcharges from coin sales go to reduce national debt, while the other 50% is given to the Independence Hall Preservation Fund for capital improvements and projects in Independence National Historic Park. The Comptroller General can audit the Independence Hall Preservation Fund's expenditures. The Secretary must ensure that minting coins will not cost the government. Payment or security is required before issuing coins under this Act."
