    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that Californians are concerned about the costs of growing older, especially long-term care. Many cannot afford nursing home care, with Latino voters particularly lacking long-term care insurance. The Legislature intends to establish a task force to explore creating a statewide insurance program for long-term care services. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is created in the Department of Insurance to design and implement a statewide long-term care insurance program. It consists of nine members including the commissioner, health care services director, aging department director, and appointees with expertise in actuarial science, health policy, long-term care providers, senior/consumer organizations, and long-term care workers. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force, consisting of nine members, is tasked with designing a statewide long-term care insurance program. The task force is subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and is prohibited from receiving compensation. Their responsibilities include exploring program design, eligibility, benefits, financing, and interaction with other publicly funded resources. They will consider incorporating the program into the state disability insurance structure. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is designing a program for working adults to make voluntary premium contributions for long-term care needs. It includes mandatory enrollment with a voluntary opt-out option and provides basic insurance benefits for those with functional limitations. The program aims to help individuals stay in their communities by purchasing nonmedical services and supports. It also offsets costs for adults with chronic conditions and evaluates coordination with existing private health care coverage. Additionally, it assesses the demands on the long-term care workforce in California. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is recommending the establishment of a joint public and private system to make long-term care accessible in California. They are also making recommendations for key regulatory provisions for public access to existing and future long-term care insurance programs. The task force will operate within existing budgetary resources and will submit a report on options for a statewide long-term care insurance program by July 1, 2017. To ensure a viable long-term care program, an actuarial report must be produced by July 1, 2018, based on task force recommendations. The report will be reviewed by the task force members and submitted to the Legislature. The commissioner has the authority to seek private funds for program implementation. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended or deleted by a new statute before that date."
