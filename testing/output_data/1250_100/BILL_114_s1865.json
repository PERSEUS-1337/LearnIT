The Congress finds that anorexia nervosa poses a high risk of death, with significant health consequences such as osteoporosis and cardiac issues. Approximately 14.5 million people in the US suffer from eating disorders, with a high rate of comorbidity with other illnesses. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starvation and weight loss. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are serious eating disorders with associated health consequences. Anorexia nervosa is linked to heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and a higher risk of suicide. Bulimia nervosa can lead to cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental problems. Binge eating disorder involves frequent episodes of uncontrolled overeating. Binge eating is often associated with obesity, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, increased risk of various cancers, diabetes, and arthritic damage. Many individuals exhibit symptoms of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder. Eating disorders are more common in women, but occur in men as well.
