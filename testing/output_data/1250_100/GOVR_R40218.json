    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. Despite these efforts, research shows that foster youth struggle more than their peers in transitioning to adulthood. Former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including higher likelihood of forgoing higher education, poor health, homelessness, and reliance on public supports. Efforts by policy makers and advocates have highlighted the need for support for youth aging out of care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 was passed to provide a safety net for older youth in care, recognizing that most are not ready to live independently at age 18. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) provides protections for older youth in foster care and promotes normalcy for children in care. Implementation challenges exist for extending foster care to older youth under P.L. 110-351. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act allows for extending care after age 18, but states may be hesitant due to costs. Transition plans must be developed within 90 days of exiting care, with concerns about challenges faced by older foster youth during the transition to adulthood. Emancipated youth struggle with forming connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. The national database will provide insight into outcomes for youth transitioning from foster care, including education, employment, and contact with social services and criminal justice systems. Concerns include vulnerability to child sex trafficking. P.L. 113-183 requires child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress should monitor state implementation and identify best practices for serving victims. This report discusses implementation of select aspects of P.L. 110-351 and ongoing issues related to transitioning youth from foster care. The number of children in foster care has been declining in the past decade. In FY2002, approximately 523,000 children were in foster care, compared to 397,122 in FY2012. The share of older children in care increased but then declined slightly. Children ages 13 through 17 comprised about 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. The number of youth aging out of foster care reached a recent all-time low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. Research shows that youth in foster care tend to experience more negative outcomes in adulthood than their peers. Former foster youth tend to experience more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. A study tracked outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, who entered care before age 16. Data was collected at different ages, with the most recent results at age 26 showing that former foster youth had lower educational and employment achievements than their peers. Former foster youth face challenges in attaining higher education and stable employment compared to their peers. They encounter barriers such as financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. While they have a high job-holding rate, fewer are currently employed, with lower average annual income. The child welfare agency, supported by federal and state funds like Title IV-E foster care, plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and permanency of children removed from their homes due to various reasons. The source of funding for child welfare services is Title IV-E foster care, under the Social Security Act. States must meet requirements to receive federal funds, including creating written case plans for children in foster care and conducting regular case reviews. Specific procedures apply to older youth in care, with additional requirements for those aged 14 and older. The case plan for children in foster care aged 14 and older must include programs and services for transition to adulthood, a list of rights, consultation with the child in plan development, and the option for the child to choose advisors and advocates. The child's advisor and advocate can apply the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard\" for extracurricular activities. States must assist youth with transition plans for housing post-emancipation. Efforts are made to reunite children with parents or find adoptive parents. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares youth for adulthood post-care. The 110th Congress enacted reforms in the child welfare system with the Fostering Connections to Success Act. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, including provisions for older youth in foster care. States can now extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 19, 20, or 21. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) provides protections for older youth in care and promotes normalcy for children in foster care. Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states and Indian tribes can receive federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in foster care. The federal government is obligated to reimburse states for eligible expenditures. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, being a citizen or qualified alien, meeting income/assets tests, age requirements, and family structure rules. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide foster care maintenance payments for eligible children in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school enrollment travel. Federal reimbursement is available for these costs for children placed in licensed settings. Federal reimbursement for child welfare funds is available for children in licensed foster care or child care institutions. States and tribes must promote safety and well-being for all youth in care, regardless of eligibility for federal payments. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until age 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. States can seek reimbursement for youth over 18 who are in school, vocational training, employment, or participating in programs to promote employment. States and tribes can seek federal reimbursement for older youth in foster care who are unable to work due to a medical condition supported by their case plan. Reimbursement is available for youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions, excluding certain types of facilities. Additionally, states may seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older who remain in foster care. States may seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older in foster care who are placed in a supervised independent living setting. HHS encourages extending federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with states and tribes required to establish criteria for employment, education, and medical conditions. Funding under Title IV-E is contingent upon an approved plan outlining these criteria. States and tribes must establish criteria for youth in extended foster care, including education and employment activities. HHS advises providing assistance to youth age 18 and older to ensure ample support. Program instructions address Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria. To be eligible for federal foster care, youth in extended care must meet Title IV-E criteria related to income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from their home. Eligibility for youth age 18 or older entering or reentering care is based on the youth themselves, not their parents or guardians. Youth must have entered care via court order or voluntary placement agreement. Court orders or agreements in place before age 18 still apply for youth remaining in care after turning 18. The court-ordered removal or voluntary agreement before age 18 still applies for youth in extended care. Instructions specify criteria for removal for youth aged 18 or older, including court determination or voluntary placement agreement. State and tribal agencies can meet placement and care rules for older youth through written authorization, voluntary agreement, or court order. Placement in supervised independent living is permitted for youth in extended care. P.L. 110-351 allows youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations for independent living settings, giving states and tribes discretion to develop various options. Examples of eligible settings include host homes, college dorms, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes must apply the same case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care as they do for children under 18. Case plans for youth aged 18 and older should include benchmarks for achieving independence and be reviewed every six months. Efforts should be made to finalize a permanency plan for older youth every 12 months. The guidance advises on permanency plans for youth in foster care, including emancipation goals and preparation efforts by child welfare agencies. Courts can determine permanency plan efforts without a hearing for children in foster care. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements, but must continue for children under 18. Medicaid eligibility is extended to youth in care after age 18. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions had extended foster care until age 21 for youth receiving federal foster care maintenance payments. Approved plans for 18 states and the District of Columbia allow youth to remain in care under certain conditions, with exemptions for medical reasons in some cases. Nebraska recently enacted legislation to extend care to age 21, pending HHS review. Some states allow youth to remain in foster care beyond age 18 under certain conditions, such as being in school or participating in a program for employment barriers. Factors to consider include outcomes, costs, court oversight, and the type of placements for older youth. Research on youth who stay in care past 18 is limited, with the Midwest Evaluation being one of the few studies in this area. The Midwest Evaluation study found that youth who remained in foster care until age 20 in Illinois had more positive outcomes compared to those who emancipated at age 18 in Iowa and Wisconsin. Remaining in care was linked to higher earnings and delayed pregnancy, with each additional year in care after age 18 associated with increased earnings. The study found that youth in Illinois who remained in foster care until age 20 had better outcomes, including higher earnings and lower pregnancy rates. However, these benefits seemed to diminish two years after aging out, as they were less likely to have completed a two- or four-year degree. This could be due to a lack of access to support services. Young people transitioning from foster care may struggle to receive necessary support for academic and social/emotional needs due to budget constraints in some states. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative recommends convening a planning group of stakeholders and reviewing federal requirements to extend care beyond age 18. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies on extending care. Research suggests that providing intensive transitional living services can offset costs to society, such as welfare payments and prison admissions. One study evaluated the costs and benefits of extending foster care based on Illinois' experience. Based on Illinois' experience in providing care beyond age 18, researchers estimated the annual cost to be around $20,800, with potential benefits including increased wages from attending college. The analysis found an average return of $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over their lifetime. However, the analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or potential societal benefits. The analysis did not examine the potential benefits of extending care, such as higher tax revenues and reductions in homelessness, as well as nonmarket benefits to former foster youth. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. Eligibility criteria include income/assets tests, family structure rules, specific judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. The federal government reimburses states for foster care maintenance payments based on the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 73%. Program administration costs are reimbursed at 50%, and training costs at 75%. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible due to the high expense. Extending care only to certain eligible youth may raise equity concerns. States are expected to cover the full costs for children who do not meet IV-E eligibility criteria from state or local funds. States extending care to youth beyond age 18 may establish different reimbursement levels and services based on Title IV-E eligibility. Eligible youth can remain in care by meeting certain criteria, but some states restrict eligibility based on specific activities, potentially raising equity concerns. For example, limiting extended care to only those in post-secondary education may exclude youth pursuing other pathways. Federal child welfare law mandates state courts to oversee the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of IV-E eligibility or the circumstances of entry into care. Regular case reviews are required every six months to assess progress towards addressing the reasons for entering care, with a permanency plan established within 12 months of placement in foster care. Permanency plans for children in care must be established at a permanency hearing, with regular reviews every 12 months. Court oversight applies to all children under 18 and those 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under a voluntary placement agreement. In states that extend care to youth beyond age 18, different levels of services may be provided based on IV-E eligibility. Non-IV-E eligible youth may not have the same oversight and supervision. Little is known about these youth, hindering policymakers from assessing their needs. Juvenile courts' jurisdiction over cases involving youth turning 18 and how hearings for older youth should be conducted are separate issues. The American Bar Association has made recommendations regarding older youth in juvenile courts. The American Bar Association recommends that states enact legislation to extend juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care. They also suggest that older youth be actively involved in their hearings and be the central participant. Stakeholders emphasize the need for different support systems for youth in foster care at age 18 and older. The Jim Casey Foundation highlights the challenges faced by foster youth transitioning out of care. Young people in foster care face anxiety about aging out of a system that does not meet their needs. Simply extending traditional foster care is not enough to support their transition to adulthood. Extended care should be developmentally appropriate, taking into account the trauma they have experienced and involving them in decision-making. Research on adolescent brain development shows that young adults need years to transition successfully. Extended care for young people transitioning to adulthood emphasizes the need for strong social supports, opportunities to learn from mistakes, and developing healthy relationships. It involves graduated levels of supervision, redesigning case planning, and supporting youth in building their social networks. The focus is on empowering young people to take on increasing responsibility and make meaningful connections. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers identified reasons why some youth in Illinois do not remain in care despite state policies. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were determined through data evaluation, surveys, focus groups, and interviews. Five factors were identified, including the active role of some juvenile courts in retaining youth. The study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago identified factors influencing youth leaving care in Illinois, including the active role of juvenile courts in retaining youth. Stakeholders in the child welfare system had varying understanding of laws and policies allowing youth to remain in care until age 21. Regions with limited foster care placements for older youth saw lower retention rates. Stable relationships with adults and youth attitudes towards staying in care also impacted retention. These findings may be relevant to states without extended care beyond age 18. States that extend foster care allow youth aged 18 or older to return to care if they face challenges living independently. The HHS program instructions from July 2010 permit states to extend foster care assistance up to age 19, 20, or 21. A 2014 report by the GAO found that 19 states enable young people to leave and re-enter care, with 12 states allowing youth to stay in care under voluntary placement agreements. Youth who remain in foster care at age 18 and older may live independently in a supervised setting. States that extend foster care allow youth aged 18 or older to return to care if they face challenges living independently. The HHS program instructions from July 2010 permit states to extend foster care assistance up to age 19, 20, or 21. In independent living settings, the child welfare agency continues to provide supervision, and the youth has not been formally reunified with their parent or guardian. Advocates emphasize the importance of young adults in care learning essential life skills while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues, such as purchasing independent living units. In considering independent living settings for foster youth, child welfare agencies must address several key issues. These include deciding whether to purchase units or contract with organizations, screening individuals living with the youth, determining rent and utility responsibilities, frequency of case worker visits, consequences for violating lease terms, options for transitioning to different settings, and managing maintenance payments. Additionally, support services should be in place for youth transitioning back into their parent or guardian's home. States providing extended care for youth age 18 and older face challenges in finding suitable housing options. Minnesota allows youth to live in various settings like apartments, homes, and dorms. The state is working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Youth can live with roommates but not with parents or significant others. Independent living settings do not need to be licensed, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates. The law also focuses on connecting youth with caring adults through adoption or placement with relatives. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth after turning 18. As of FY2011, states and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, up to their 21st birthday if they are enrolled in school, employed, or in an activity promoting employment. Assistance can continue past 21 if the youth has a medical condition or handicap warranting it. This extension also applies to kinship guardianship assistance. As of FY2011, states and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, up to their 21st birthday if they are enrolled in school, employed, or in an activity promoting employment. Assistance can continue past 21 if the youth has a medical condition or handicap warranting it. HHS's July 2010 program instructions direct states to extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties or refer more broadly to tribal kin, extended family and friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. States and tribes may establish conditions for a person to qualify as a child's guardian or enter into a legal guardianship arrangement, such as requiring a child to be in care for more than a six-month period and targeting certain age groups for guardianship, like children over age 12. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth expected to emancipate from foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth aging out of foster care to help them transition to self-sufficiency. It assists with employment, education, housing, and personal development through mentors and other adults. States and tribes can offer independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16 for adoption or kinship guardianship. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act further supports these efforts. The Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a purpose area to the Chafee program to ensure foster care children have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. The CFCIP provides funding for independent living programs for youth aging out of foster care, including services like housing, education, counseling, and mentoring. States must match 20% of the funds received and describe their plans in the Child and Family Services Plan to be eligible for CFCIP funds. States and tribes must outline their independent living program in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan, ensuring statewide coverage for children of various ages and stages of independence. They must certify meeting specific requirements, such as limiting funds for room and board of youth ages 18 to 21. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program provides support for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted at age 16 or older, with Congress allocating $45 million annually for the program. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program allocates approximately $45 million annually to provide vouchers worth up to $5,000 per eligible youth for higher education expenses. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completion. Independent living services are also available to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. States provide CFCIP services to youth likely to remain in foster care until age 18, with discretion in defining this term. States need to prioritize which youth to serve and ensure capacity for independent living programs. Child welfare law requires a transition plan for youth, including housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services, to be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes provisions for health care decision-making and the option to execute legal documents. It is separate from the case plan but complements it. The case plan for youth in care outlines placement and care details, while the transition plan focuses on services for independent living post-care. The transition plan involves identifying housing options and is directed by the youth with input from others. It is separate from the case plan and is reviewed annually during court hearings. The transition plan for youth in foster care is not reviewed by a court or other body, but annual hearings are held to review permanency goals. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to start engaging youth in the transition plan process well before the 90-day period. Questions arise for youth who emancipate before age 18 without a transition plan, potentially leaving them less prepared than their peers. States and tribes may not assist in developing transition plans for youth who remain in care past age 18 but leave before age 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are creating guidance on transition planning, emphasizing youth engagement and focusing on achieving permanency with caring adults. Plans should consider the strengths of young people, be youth-directed, and involve collaboration among service providers and those close to the youth. In a 2014 report, states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care. Nearly all jurisdictions require youth input on the plan and ensuring key documents are included. Some challenges reported include lack of staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing for transitioning youth. Transition planning processes in Hawaii and Nebraska involve engaging youth in decision-making through conferences and transition planning kits. These initiatives aim to assist youth in making decisions about their future, with specific options outlined in federal law, as well as considerations for transportation and spirituality. Foster Club's transition planning kit in Nebraska includes roles for the transition plan team and courts, a transition proposal checklist, and a \"permanency pact\" to identify individuals who can provide support during the transition process. Even with the passage of P.L. 110-351, concerns remain about challenges faced by older foster youth transitioning to adulthood. Research shows difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Little is known about outcomes for youth leaving foster care, but a new national database may provide insight. Congress is focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, including those at risk of going missing or being victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address issues faced by vulnerable youth, including those who aged out of foster care. A study tracking former foster youth at age 26 found they were more likely to be married but less likely to live with their parents. Many alumni reported not having strong relationships with their biological family members. Despite federal protections, former foster youth often lack strong relationships with relatives after leaving care. Child welfare practitioners advocate for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by promoting long-term connections to caring adults, which can provide crucial support. Some jurisdictions actively work to ensure permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care. Practitioners emphasize the importance of permanency, which involves a safe, stable, and secure relationship with a committed adult, whether legal or not. Developing these relationships is crucial for youth in foster care to achieve successful outcomes. Child welfare researchers advise caution in helping foster youth develop lasting connections with adults to achieve permanency. Advocates urge policy makers to initiate permanency planning before youth leave care through the case planning process. More research is needed on facilitating healthy relationships between foster youth and their family members. Permanency planning for foster youth involves determining a permanent plan before they leave care, which can include goals such as returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. Another planned permanent living arrangement (APPLA) may be chosen if none of these goals are feasible, with a compelling reason required. APPLA was introduced in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to provide a stable, permanent arrangement for children in foster care. Permanency planning for foster youth involves determining a permanent plan before they leave care, which can include goals such as returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. Another option, planned permanent living arrangement (APPLA), should involve a specific adult or couple caring for the young person, living with them permanently. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is sometimes used as a default permanency goal, and that certain settings like group care should only be considered if a family setting is not feasible. In December 2010, the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper discussing policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care, emphasizing the importance of achieving permanency goals. The white paper discussed policy options related to APPLA, including eliminating it as a case plan goal or restricting it to older teenagers after intensive family finding. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA, with additional requirements for those with this plan during annual hearings and periodic reviews. The periodic review of a child's status in foster care ensures the state agency continues to seek a permanent family for children with an APPLA designation. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood through mentoring opportunities. Proposed changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by including steps for a permanent living arrangement upon emancipation. The transition planning process for youth aging out of foster care includes documentation of steps to find a permanent placement with adult connections. Some states require intensive efforts to ensure young people have adult connections. In Texas, youth receive assistance in identifying caring adults for support after leaving care. Foster Club's Permanency Pact aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood. The Permanency Pact by Foster Club helps youth aging out of foster care connect with caring adults for lifelong support. Efforts to support permanency include Adoption Opportunity Grants for older youth, focusing on open adoption and securing permanent connections. Federal grants could fund mentoring programs for current and former foster youth to achieve permanency. The Department of Justice has funded mentoring programs for teens in care, with legislation introduced in Congress to authorize permanent funding for grants. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety and well-being of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention. Youth in foster care, especially those who run away, are vulnerable to trafficking, and there are limitations in the capacity of child welfare agencies to respond to their needs. The response of child welfare agencies to sex trafficking victims is limited due to various factors such as inadequate training, resources, and high caseloads. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across different sectors to address child sex trafficking. Congressional hearings have discussed the challenges and opportunities for child welfare agencies in combating child sex trafficking. Child welfare agencies have made efforts to combat child sex trafficking, leading to the passage of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183). The act amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. These procedures must be developed in consultation with various organizations and implemented within two years of the bill's enactment. Additionally, state agencies are required to report to law enforcement authorities within two years of the act's enactment. Child welfare agencies must report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours. State agencies must annually report the total number of sex trafficking victims to HHS. HHS must then report this information to Congress and the public. HHS is also required to submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide services for victims. Additionally, HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking must advise the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on policies to improve the response to domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system. Congress should monitor states' implementation of requirements, including providing guidance to child welfare agencies, serving youth not in foster care, reporting victims to the federal government, and identifying best practices for victim services. State agencies are mandated to serve child and youth victims already in the child welfare system. Pending legislation like H.R. 5081 would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Stakeholders have called for more targeted services for children in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) directs state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care and determining the reasons for their disappearance. This law emphasizes the need for a coordinated response and involvement of other entities when a child goes missing. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, determining reasons for their disappearance, and addressing factors contributing to their absence. Agencies must report information to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authorities. This law highlights the importance of a coordinated response and involvement of other entities in cases of missing children. The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) guidelines from 2005 recommend that state child welfare agencies have procedures in place to recruit, retain, and train a competent workforce, involve various stakeholders in decision-making, examine foster care facilities with high runaway rates, and take corrective action as needed. States also need to define \"missing\" children and consider reporting all missing children to law enforcement, including those whose whereabouts are known but are not at their foster care placements. States may need to restrict reporting missing children from care to situations where law enforcement can provide the most assistance, as they may have competing demands and limited resources. Law enforcement agencies may not respond as vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, due to various factors. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and the courts could help prevent children from going missing, but federal child welfare policy only provides general requirements in this regard. The CWLA Best Practices and NCMEC guidelines encourage collaboration between law enforcement and child welfare agencies to define roles and share definitions of missing children. State child welfare agencies report missing children from foster care to HHS through AFCARS, but there is limited tracking for children missing for other reasons. States may need to improve tracking to locate children who are no longer in their care. Child welfare stakeholders have concerns about limitations on foster youth participating in normal activities due to safety policies. Restrictions include no sleepovers, dating, phone use, driving, working, school trips, and sports without background screenings. Youth's desire for independence may lead to risky behaviors. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addresses concerns about limitations on foster youth participating in normal activities. It includes provisions for promoting normalcy and establishing a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents to enable youth in care to engage in age-appropriate activities. Congress will monitor the law's implementation one year after enactment. The law requires child welfare agencies to provide training to foster parents on children's developmental stages and the reasonable and prudent parent standard. States must revise licensing standards for foster homes to reflect provisions around normalcy. Concerns exist about the lack of adequate housing for youth aging out of foster care, with studies showing varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth. Former foster youth face challenges with housing, with studies showing that 24% of 23-year-olds have experienced homelessness. Some resort to couch surfing, lacking permanent housing. Individual characteristics, involvement with the child welfare system, and the housing market all impact their housing status. Lack of housing can lead to difficulties in education and employment. While states can allocate funds for room and board, it may not be sufficient. Former foster youth may have access to housing programs provided by nonprofit organizations, housing developers, or property management agencies. These programs offer various housing options such as single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. Most programs focus on independent living support and require youth to be employed or in school. However, none of the programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. States that offer extended foster care options can house youth in foster homes or independent living settings, but they face challenges in finding suitable accommodations. Some states face challenges in finding appropriate housing options for current and former foster youth in college, especially during school breaks when college facilities are closed. California law requires public universities to review housing issues for emancipated foster youth living in college dormitories. The Higher Education Act addresses housing concerns for youth in foster care by authorizing services, including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. The Higher Education Act allows for temporary housing for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13, especially during academic breaks. Additionally, owners of properties with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits can designate units for low-income students who were in foster care. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care are at higher risk of disconnection. Those who age out of care have low employment rates and earnings. A study in three states showed that at age 24, only three out of five emancipated youth were employed, earning significantly less than their counterparts nationally. Young people in foster care face challenges in education, with lower earnings compared to their peers. By age 26, only about 7% of foster care alumni attained a degree, highlighting the need for additional support in completing their education. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in foster care, requiring state agencies to provide necessary support in each child's case plan. The law mandates that state child welfare agencies consider the proximity of a child's school when placing them in foster care. Educational records must be included in the child's case plan, and efforts should be made to keep the child in their current school or enroll them in a new one if necessary. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin.\" Additionally, states must ensure that children in foster care receive necessary educational support. The law requires states to ensure that children in foster care who have reached the minimum school attendance age are enrolled in school or have completed high school. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the educational needs of foster youth, with recent legislation seeking to improve access to education for these vulnerable populations. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children and youth in foster care through federal education statutes. For instance, S. 1094 would require state education agencies to ensure that children in foster care remain in their current school or enroll them in a new school if it's in their best interest. The bill also mandates policies for transferring school credits and providing supportive educational services for foster youth under the Higher Education Act. The federal Trio programs provide services like mentoring and tutoring for foster youth and homeless children. These programs aim to identify potential post-secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds, prepare them for higher education, and provide support services while in college. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care, and to provide them with information about available federal educational resources. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is a key source of funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of these services and the outcomes of foster youth after leaving care. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) will provide a national perspective on how former foster youth transition to adulthood, but full implementation may take several years. This program is the primary funding source for independent living services for transition-age youth in and recently emancipated from foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides $140 million annually to states for independent living services for transition-age youth in foster care. States must provide a 20% match to receive funds, and many states spend additional money on services beyond the match. Research on the effectiveness of these programs is limited, but evaluations are conducted on innovative programs funded by the CFCIP. The Urban Institute and partners conducted an evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth funded by P.L. 106-169. The evaluation aimed to assess the programs' impact on educational attainment, employment rates, interpersonal skills, pregnancy rates, and delinquency. 1,400 foster youth in California and Massachusetts were assigned to different programs and surveyed at three points over two years. In-person interviews were also conducted with various stakeholders. The evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth in California and Massachusetts found no significant impacts overall. However, the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care showed positive impacts on education outcomes. The program aims to help youth achieve educational success, avoid risky behaviors, and gain employment. The Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care aims to empower youth to make positive decisions about their lives. Social workers oversee a small caseload of youth, providing support with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses and applying for college. The program emphasizes educational and employment outcomes, with youth more likely to enroll in and stay in college. The evaluation of the Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care found that youth who remained in care were more likely to receive help in educational assistance, employment assistance, money management, and financial assistance for housing. The program showed promising results in education outcomes, but did not significantly impact outcomes in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or independent living preparedness. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and the role of classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of foster youth, providing insight into their outcomes. States have reported information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act. The Act mandated the development of outcome measures to assess state performance in operating independent living programs. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to track demographic and outcome information of foster youth. States collect data on youth receiving independent living services and report on their outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive services. States track youth receiving independent living services at ages 17, 19, and 21, with the option to sample youth to reduce data collection burden. Financial penalties are imposed on states that do not meet data submission requirements."
