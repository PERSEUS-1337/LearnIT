    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Urban Watershed Model Restoration Act\". Anacostia River Watershed Restoration and Protection Pilot Program is established. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will develop a pilot program in the Anacostia River watershed to demonstrate methods for urban watershed restoration and community redevelopment. The program aims to meet water quality objectives and reduce environmental health risks through coordination with various government programs. The program in the Anacostia River watershed aims to support monitoring efforts, develop environmental indicators, provide grants to community groups, establish restoration goals, maintain public input, offer education on environmental resources, and promote community involvement in decision-making processes. The Anacostia River watershed program aims to develop consensus strategies for watershed restoration, maintain a biennial work planning process, demonstrate new technologies for stormwater management, participate in urban habitat improvement projects, assist in toxics reduction, and implement on-the-ground restoration projects. The Anacostia River watershed program includes implementing on-the-ground restoration projects and maintaining the Biennial Work Plan for the watershed. The Administrator may set aside funds for challenge grants, with the EPA covering at least 75% of the costs. The Administrator will coordinate with other Federal agencies for the pilot program, reporting to Congress annually on activities and results. $750,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2000-2004 for the program."
