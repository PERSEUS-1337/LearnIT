The Act emphasizes the cost to society and the potential prevention of injuries through universal helmet use. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 emphasizes the importance of promoting bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16 through grants for programs that enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, and educate on safety. Grants allow for flexibility in program design to increase helmet usage. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 requires bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after enactment to conform to interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, with a final standard to be established within 60 days. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 mandates that bicycle helmets meet interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90 until a final standard is established within 60 days. The final standard must address helmet security, child injury risks, and may include additional provisions. The Consumer Product Safety Act sections 7, 9, and 11 do not apply to this process. Non-conforming helmets are considered in violation of safety standards until the final standard takes effect. The curr_chunk states that any standard under subsection (c) is considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is authorized to receive appropriations of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 for a grant program. An \"approved bicycle helmet\" is defined as meeting interim and final standards described in the Act."
