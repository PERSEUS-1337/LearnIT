    "content": "The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" establishes National Science Foundation research grants for coastal engineering and shoreline protection. Additionally, it includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose artificial reef and habitat restoration projects instead of fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. The amendment allows publicly owned shores with insufficient public access to be considered privately owned for shoreline protection projects. Cost sharing rules are updated to include these shores. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules for implementation to ensure public access. The Secretary will ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore with assistance, allowing exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Funds are available for a pilot program and projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control without further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for projects related to beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for carrying out these projects in accordance with cost-sharing requirements and other applicable regulations. Transactions involving the funds in the account must be reported annually to Congress. Any excess funds not needed for current withdrawals are to be invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States by the Secretary of the Treasury.

Obligations in the account can be acquired at the issue price or market price, and can be sold at the market price. Interest and proceeds from the sale or redemption of obligations held in the account are credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly carry out a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and waterways. Information collected will include wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, and water quality. The pilot program for a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States includes tracking water quality, fishing boat locations, oil spills, beach erosion, weather, sediment observation, and coastal mapping. Federal cooperation involves the Geological Survey, Navy, and EPA. Regional test projects will be established in Southern California and another location. Coordination with existing efforts will not be replaced. The program aims to coordinate efforts and gather new information on ocean conditions without duplicating existing monitoring efforts by Federal, State, and local entities. $4,000,000 from the Beach Nourishment Account will be available annually from 2001 to 2006, with $2,000,000 allocated for each of the 2 regional test projects mentioned in the section."
