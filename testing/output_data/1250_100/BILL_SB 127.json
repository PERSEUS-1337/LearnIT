    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, there is a lack of support for individual homeowners with groundwater wells who cannot afford necessary improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, and connecting to local water systems. The board will establish a program to offer loans and grants to local agencies and eligible applicants for purposes such as extending service lines, paying fees for connections, and closing abandoned septic tanks and wells for health and safety reasons. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury to provide funding for improving existing groundwater wells, installing water treatment systems for contaminated groundwater, and adopting necessary regulations. The fund includes moneys repaid from grants or loans, as well as interest earned on the fund. An eligible applicant for a loan from the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, be unable to secure financial assistance from private lenders, and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. The loan must be repaid within 20 years with a 1 percent interest rate, secured by a mortgage on the residence, and the recipient must maintain homeowner's insurance. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. Eligible grant applicants must have a household income below 60% of the statewide median, own the residence, and be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders. Grant recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. $10 million is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. The act is urgent for public safety due to the need for access to clean water during a drought. It defines a \"water project\" and establishes procedures for challenges to environmental impact reports or project approvals. The Judicial Council must adopt a rule of court by July 1, 2016, to expedite actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water projects. The draft and final reports must include a notice about the procedures for judicial challenges. The draft and final environmental impact reports must include the full text of the section. Within 10 days of releasing the draft report, an informational workshop must be conducted. A public hearing must be held within 10 days before the end of the comment period. Commenters can request nonbinding mediation within five days after the comment period closes. The lead agency must select mediators with expertise in land use and environmental law or science. Mediation sessions will address areas of dispute raised by commenters. Any agreed-upon measures must be adopted as a condition of approval. Written comments submitted after the public comment period will only be considered if they address new issues raised by the lead agency's response to comments. The lead agency must address new issues raised in response to comments, provide new information released after the draft report, disclose changes made to the project post-public comment period, propose conditions for approval, and file the required notice within five days of the last project approval. The lead agency is responsible for preparing and certifying the record of proceedings, with costs covered by the applicant. Within three business days of releasing the draft environmental impact report, the lead agency must make it and all related documents available to the public in an electronic format. Any additional documents related to the report must also be shared within five business days of their preparation or receipt. The lead agency must make an index of copyright protected documents available in electronic format by the release of the draft environmental impact report. Written comments on the project should be submitted in electronic format and made available to the public within five days. Comments not in electronic format must be converted and shared in electronic format within seven days. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must provide a certified record of proceedings to the superior court for resolution of any disputes. If there is a dispute over the content of the record, the superior court will decide, and a party can file a motion to augment the record when filing their initial brief. In granting relief in an action brought under this division, the court shall not stay construction of a water project unless there is an imminent threat to public health or important unforeseen artifacts or values at the project site. If so, only specific activities posing a threat will be enjoined. An action to challenge a decision of the lead agency for project approval is subject to specific requirements. No reimbursement is needed for this act as local agencies can raise charges to cover mandated services."
