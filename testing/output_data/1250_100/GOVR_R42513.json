    "content": "Recent events have reignited congressional interest in safe management of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. The Fukushima Dai-ichi incident in Japan and the termination of the Yucca Mountain project have increased concerns. This report focuses on the current situation of spent nuclear fuel storage in the United States, emphasizing the need for a geological repository for long-term disposal. The Yucca Mountain repository project in Nevada was terminated in 2009, sparking debates on extended storage for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). There is no clear consensus on interim storage solutions, with key questions on strategies, locations, and management structures. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future released a final report in 2012, following extensive efforts and public input. Views on the safety of the current SNF storage situation vary among different organizations. Some analysts suggest constructing an interim centralized storage facility at a volunteer location after sufficient cooling of spent nuclear fuel. The primary storage technologies in the United States are wet pool storage and dry cask storage. Senator Dianne Feinstein emphasized the need to rethink how spent fuel is managed during a hearing in March 2011. Senator Feinstein urged for a policy change to expedite the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from wet pools to dry cask storage, citing concerns about long-term storage in pools and referencing a study by the National Academy of Sciences. Senator Feinstein expressed concern about spent fuel management and the need for a more rapid shift to dry cask storage. The NRC and a House Appropriations Subcommittee also highlighted the importance of consolidating spent fuel for safety and security. While consolidated interim storage has support, specific location proposals face opposition. The issue of spent fuel storage is interconnected with broader nuclear power plant operations, reprocessing, and permanent repository establishment. This report focuses solely on spent fuel storage and does not delve into these related issues. Worldwide, there are 436 operational nuclear power reactors in 32 countries and 122 permanently shut-down nuclear power reactors. No country has established a permanent disposal site for high-level nuclear waste, relying on long-term storage instead. The United States operates a geological repository for plutonium-contaminated waste in New Mexico, known as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The WIPP site does not accept spent nuclear fuel or high-level waste, but is considered a model for waste disposal. The United States does not have a permanent disposal site for high-level nuclear waste, relying on long-term storage instead. A recent survey found that all countries store substantial amounts of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in pools or dry cask facilities. Despite the focus on the proposed Yucca Mountain repository, long-term storage of SNF will be necessary due to delays in opening a permanent geologic repository. The United States relies on long-term storage for high-level nuclear waste as there is no permanent disposal site. The Yucca Mountain repository program was terminated, leading to the need for commercial interim storage until at least 2056. The NWPA sets a limit on the first repository, with 90% allocated to commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Yucca Mountain repository may exceed its legal limit due to the amount of stored spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Department of Energy suggests the repository could hold more than the limit and could accommodate a larger inventory. Consideration for safe long-term storage of nuclear waste is crucial, even if a permanent disposal site is not established. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recommends including long-term interim storage of spent nuclear fuel in fuel cycle design. Concerns about permanent geologic repositories have led to discussions on long-term storage options since the 1970s. Various programs and amendments have been proposed, including the establishment of a Monitored Retrievable Storage Commission and a Nuclear Waste Negotiator. Congressional attempts in the 1990s to establish a temporary consolidated storage site were unsuccessful. Analysts recommend interim storage of spent nuclear fuel for at least 100 years due to its long-term radioactivity. While stored fuel poses risks, there have been no significant public exposures or health impacts from any releases of radioactivity. Significant concerns have been raised about potential releases from stored spent nuclear fuel, especially after the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident in Japan. Extended storage raises worries about long-term site safety, including risks from extreme weather and sea level rise. The NRC found that sea level rise is not a credible threat to existing nuclear waste storage. The federal government faces a growing liability for failing to accept waste from commercial utilities under the 1987 NWPA, resulting in approximately $1 billion in claims paid. Claims for SNF storage costs have been ongoing since 2000, with estimated future costs of $500 million per year. Concerns about nuclear waste management have hindered investment in new nuclear power plants, leading to industry stagnation and high capital costs. The buildup of spent fuel at reactor sites and lack of progress on final disposition could hinder the growth of the domestic nuclear power industry by discouraging investment in new plants. Public acceptance of nuclear energy may depend on a credible promise of a geologic repository becoming available. Without a new, credible regime for disposing of nuclear waste, expansion of nuclear power is unlikely. The current impasse in the U.S. nuclear waste program is seen as a hindrance to the industry's growth and has already proven damaging and costly. The current impasse in the U.S. nuclear waste program is proving damaging and costly, with potential long-term consequences. States have imposed their own controls on spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management, hindering the growth of the domestic nuclear power industry. This issue not only affects energy supply options but also state-federal relations, public confidence in the federal government, and America's global standing in nuclear safety and security. The commercial nuclear fuel consists of uranium oxide pellets in zirconium alloy tubes, arranged in fuel assemblies. Boiling water reactors have lighter fuel assemblies compared to pressurized water reactors. Both reactor types are light water reactors using low-enriched uranium for electricity production through nuclear fission. The fission process in nuclear power plants generates electricity by heating water to produce steam that powers a turbine generator. Fuel rods are replaced every 18 months to maintain power production levels due to the accumulation of radionuclides that interfere with the fission process. Spent nuclear fuel assemblies are removed from the reactor core after approximately 4\u00bd years of operation for storage and eventual disposal. Commercial nuclear power plants in the United States generate around 2,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) annually. This report focuses on commercial SNF, which is different from other types of SNF generated by DOE production reactors, research reactors, and naval propulsion reactors. The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has produced about 27 metric tons of SNF, stored at the Idaho National Laboratory. The United States has a small amount of Department of Energy (DOE)-owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF), which is less than 4% of the commercial SNF stored in the country. This noncommercial SNF includes various designs and sizes, similar in radioactivity hazard to commercial reactor fuel. Technical issues related to long-term storage apply to both types of fuel. SNF is stored in wet pools (73%) and dry casks (27%) in the U.S., with commercial nuclear power plants required to store SNF for at least a year in spent fuel pools for initial cooling. The United States stores spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in wet pools and dry casks. Wet storage pools have thick concrete walls, stainless steel liners, and deep water to shield workers and cool the SNF assemblies. The water chemistry is controlled to prevent corrosion. Each reactor design has unique pool storage basins. Commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. use a combination of wet pool and dry cask storage for SNF. Commercial nuclear reactors in the United States use light water reactors, specifically boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). Some spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored in the U.S. was generated by reactor types not currently used in the country. The storage pool for the GE Mark I BWR is located inside the same containment structure as the reactor. The SNF storage pools in BWR Mark I reactors are located above ground level, with capacities ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 assemblies. U.S. spent fuel pools are typically filled up to three-quarters capacity. Fukushima Dai-ichi site had a separate wet storage pool building with 6,000 spent fuel assemblies. U.S. reactor facilities do not have additional wet storage buildings for SNF consolidation like Fukushima Dai-ichi. Power is needed for makeup water circulation in wet pools to prevent fuel exposure. Dry casks are used to store recently discharged SNF to prevent boiling off of cooling water. These casks are cylindrical in shape, with an inner steel canister storing the SNF assemblies. They are stored vertically on concrete pads or horizontally in storage bunkers. The largest dry casks in the U.S. can hold up to 40 PWR or 68 BWR spent fuel assemblies. The Transportation, Aging, and Disposal Canister System is proposed by the DOE for SNF storage. The Transportation, Aging, and Disposal (TAD) Canister System by DOE can hold up to 21 PWR or 44 BWR spent fuel assemblies in dry casks. There are over 50 types of dry casks approved by NRC for use in the U.S., regulated under 10 C.F.R. 72. Dry storage units are passively safe, requiring no power for cooling, unlike wet storage pool systems. The robustness of dry cask storage was demonstrated during an earthquake near the North Anna nuclear power plant in 2011, with no significant impact on the storage casks or spent nuclear fuel. NRC issues general and site-specific licenses for dry storage facilities, with regulations outlined in Part 72 for storage on or off a reactor site. The first commercial dry storage system in the U.S. was established at the North Anna plant in 1986, utilizing vertical casks and horizontal modules. The use of dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel has increased rapidly since 1986. In 2010, 8,606 assemblies were transferred to dry cask storage, almost four times the average annual transfer rate since 1986. The amount of fuel stored in wet pools compared to dry systems decreased from 91% in 2002 to 73% in 2011. Storage in dry systems increased by 286% during the same period. The trend towards more dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel is likely to continue due to the need for storage and changing economic value. Spent nuclear fuel is stored at 77 different sites in the United States, including licensed operating commercial nuclear power reactors, DOE-operated sites, former operating nuclear reactor sites, and proposed reprocessing plants. Practically every site that has hosted a commercial nuclear reactor also serves as a storage site for spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has proposed plans for the storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) for up to 300 years, even if a permanent geologic repository is not decided upon. Currently, approximately three-quarters of the 67,450 MTU of commercial SNF in the United States is stored in wet pools at reactor sites. Dry cask storage is used at 55 locations for part of the storage, while 27 sites rely solely on wet pool storage. There are 63 SNF storage sites with operating commercial nuclear power reactors, and 14 sites where SNF is stored without an operating reactor. Most spent nuclear fuel (SNF) generated at reactors has not been moved to another site for storage. SNF storage is mainly located at or near the operating nuclear reactor sites. Some sites where reactors have been shut down store SNF, leading to higher storage costs due to lack of shared overhead expenses. Additionally, SNF is stored at facilities where a reactor has ceased operating but other reactors at the same site continue operating. The majority of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is stored at or near operating nuclear reactor sites, with some stored at sites where reactors have shut down. Concerns arise when SNF is stored in dry cask storage without a wet storage pool, potentially hindering future repackaging efforts. The Blue Ribbon Commission emphasized the need for consolidated storage capacity to address stranded SNF. Most SNF storage in the US is concentrated in the Midwest and on the East Coast, with over 80% stored east of the Mississippi River. The majority of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is stored at or near operating nuclear reactor sites, with some stored at sites where reactors have shut down. Nearly 84% of the SNF is stored in eastern sites compared to approximately 17% stored in western sites. The distribution of SNF by mass and number of assemblies varies between eastern and western sites, with a higher percentage of SNF stored in wet pools at eastern sites. The East has a greater share of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in dry cask storage at western sites, with operator preference being a factor. The top five states with the largest total amount of SNF stored by metric tons of heavy metal content are Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, New York, and North Carolina. Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, and Alabama have the largest amount of SNF stored in wet pools, while South Carolina, Illinois, Virginia, and Pennsylvania have the most SNF in dry storage systems. The top five states with the largest amount of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) stored by metric tons of heavy metal content are South Carolina, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and California. The rankings change depending on the number of SNF assemblies, with Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina having the largest total amount of SNF stored. Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Alabama, and North Carolina also have the most SNF stored in wet pools, while Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia have the most SNF in dry storage systems. The total amount of SNF in storage in the United States increases by approximately 2,000 MTU per year. The Department of Energy (DOE) historically accepted significant amounts of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from commercial nuclear power plants for storage and reprocessing. This included SNF from the Three Mile Island incident and reprocessing efforts in New York and Illinois. A small amount of commercial SNF was also shipped to the West Valley site in New York for reprocessing in the 1970s. The resulting high-level waste and contaminated facilities remain at the site. The DOE is responsible for storing SNF at four sites, including Fort St. Vrain, Idaho National Laboratory, Savannah River Site, and Hanford Reservation. Decommissioning and environmental remediation at the West Valley site will cost $3.7 billion and continue until at least 2020, with indefinite long-term stewardship required. The report does not estimate storage capacity or safety of re-racking SNF in denser configurations. Commercial SNF is different from DOE-owned inventory in terms of enrichment level, cladding, and condition. The DOE-owned inventory of nuclear materials includes SNF from research reactors, some of which has been reprocessed while others remain stored as solid SNF. The Savannah River Site and Hanford site have a variety of irradiated nuclear materials, including different types of fuel assemblies. DOE continues to produce and accept SNF, with some materials intended for disposal in a permanent geological repository. The SNF at DOE sites, like Hanford and Idaho, includes surplus material from reactors used for nuclear warheads production. This includes SNF from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion program and research reactors, with some materials reprocessed for high-enriched uranium. The DOE sites also store SNF debris from the Three Mile Island reactor meltdown in 1979. Commercial power reactor SNF is different in size and enrichment level compared to SNF stored at DOE sites. The SNF stored at DOE sites came from various sources such as commercial power reactors, test reactors for academic research, and medical isotopes. By the late 1980s, some SNF had deteriorated due to inadequate storage conditions. DOE implemented plans to secure the material through packaging and processing, following recommendations from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. DOE-owned spent fuel differs from commercial spent fuel in design and construction, with thin cladding for reprocessing purposes. Stabilization efforts for DOE-owned SNF have been ongoing due to its less robust nature compared to commercial SNF. The DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is less robust than commercial SNF, with thinner and less corrosion-resistant cladding. Approximately 198 MT of DOE-owned SNF and reactor-irradiated material is stored in wet and dry storage configurations at various sites. Different storage methods are used at different sites, with Hanford and Fort St. Vrain using dry casks, SRS using wet storage pools, and Idaho employing both methods. DOE is also responsible for high-level waste (HLW) from reprocessing SNF, which must be accounted for separately from commercial sites to assess the total HLW inventory in the United States. Hanford's HLW is stored in underground tanks awaiting treatment. The high-level waste (HLW) from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel (SNF) at various DOE sites is stored in underground tanks or vitrified into glass inside stainless steel canisters. The HLW at different sites like West Valley, SRS, and Idaho is awaiting treatment for disposal. The details of HLW storage, treatment facility construction, and operations are complex and beyond the scope of this report. DOE may use the SRS reprocessing \"H-canyon\" to process materials for recovery of nuclear materials or for safety reasons. The 29 MTU of SNF at the Savannah River Site comprise about 1.2% of the DOE-owned SNF, and about 0.04% of the total SNF stored in the United States. After reprocessing, the SNF would be converted to a small amount of fissile material and a larger volume of liquid acidic radioactive waste. This waste would be processed into borosilicate glass logs inside stainless steel canisters for disposal in a permanent geological repository. Evaluating hazards and risks accurately is essential for SNF management and regulation, with primary near-term hazards from radioactivity and long-term hazards from plutonium and uranium. Spent nuclear fuel poses significant hazards due to radioactivity, plutonium, and uranium. The distinction between hazard and risk is crucial in evaluating management options. Risk depends on factors like containment and exposure, with regulation requiring an assessment of probability and consequence. Some argue for high protection levels due to the potential consequences of hazardous events. Spent nuclear fuel requires high protection levels against threats to prevent risks to human health and the environment. Cooling and shielding are necessary during storage after discharge from a reactor, with SNF typically needing three to five years of wet pool storage before transfer to dry cask storage. Concerns have been raised about the safety of current SNF management practices, especially for long-term storage methods. NRC and others have considered SNF storage relatively safe with reasonable precautions. The hazards of spent nuclear fuel storage can lead to various risks under different conditions, including loss of power, external threats like hydrogen explosions, long-term degradation, and leakage of contaminated water. After the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident, concerns about fuel uncovering and water loss were raised. After the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident, concerns arose about fuel uncovering and water loss at the Dai-ichi plant. A report by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations stated that no significant fuel damage occurred, potentially caused by debris from reactor building explosions. The NRC issued a notice for reactor operators to review and take actions to prevent similar problems, emphasizing low spent fuel pool water levels in Units 3 and 4. After the Fukushima Dai-ichi incident, the Government Accountability Office recommended assessing existing storage facilities for long-term storage requirements. NRC dispatched inspectors to U.S. reactors and spent fuel storage sites, finding no significant vulnerabilities at most sites. For sites with the oldest spent nuclear fuel, the impact of an extended loss of power would be minimal due to radioactive decay. The NRC predicted minimal loss of power impact on spent fuel storage due to radioactive decay. Concerns raised after Fukushima Dai-ichi incident, but initial results show little damage to spent fuel in storage pools. Analysts worry about zirconium cladding fire risk if fuel is left uncovered. National Academies/National Research Council concluded a loss-of-pool-coolant event could trigger a zirconium cladding fire. The NRC has issued orders to address the risk of a zirconium cladding fire in spent fuel storage pools, but some believe the risk is significant, especially if the pools were drained of water. Concerns have been raised about the design of some reactors where the storage pool is located inside the same containment structure as the reactor, potentially posing safety risks. Many express safety concerns about the design of reactors with spent nuclear fuel storage pools located well above ground level. The Fukushima incident highlighted risks such as loss of power affecting cooling systems and monitoring. The height of these pools poses challenges for access and potential structural failures. After 9/11, concerns about terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools were raised. After 9/11, concerns were raised about terrorist attacks on spent nuclear fuel pools due to their structural vulnerabilities and high levels of radioactive materials. The NRC issued confidential orders and conducted site-specific evaluations resulting in incremental improvements to safety measures. However, unlike Germany, there was no large-scale shift of spent fuel out of wet pools into dry casks or hardened storage facilities in the US. The potential threat to spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage safety includes degradation of cladding and fuel elements. SNF cladding vulnerability varies by fuel rod type, with U.S. light water reactor fuel rods proving more durable than other forms. The NRC has stated that cladding is highly resistant to failure under pool storage conditions. The integrity of stored spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is being evaluated through long-term research projects recommended by various organizations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has concluded that dry cask storage provides additional confidence in the long-term storage of SNF, as long as proper procedures are followed to ensure dryness and inerting of the canister or cask. Monitoring of closure seals is actively conducted to address any potential issues. The issue of cladding integrity is also under reevaluation as part of extended storage and transportation reviews. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has identified tritium-contaminated water releases at various sites, including commercial and DOE sites like Brookhaven National Laboratory, Hanford, and Savannah River Site. Tritium contamination from spent fuel storage pools raised concerns, leading to the establishment of a Tritium Contamination Task Force in March 2010. Despite documented releases of radioactivity, there is no evidence of significant public exposures or health impacts. The NRC addressed concerns about contamination of groundwater from leaking spent nuclear fuel storage pools. NRC issued instructions to licensees and established releases to groundwater as a significant performance indicator. Litigation is ongoing regarding NRC's Waste Confidence Rule. The NRC's Waste Confidence Decisions established that spent nuclear fuel could be safely stored for at least 60 years beyond the end of a reactor's operating life. The nuclear power industry is confident in the existing dry cask storage technology for long-term storage. The NRC's Waste Confidence Decisions established that existing dry cask storage technology is sufficient to sustain storage for at least 100 years at reactors and central interim storage. The implications include no requirement to discuss environmental impact of spent fuel storage beyond the reactor operating license period. Some states and industry groups have challenged NRC's rule, with plans to consider updating the Waste Confidence Rule in 2019. The NRC plans to update the Waste Confidence Rule in 2019 after preparing an Environmental Impact Statement. Resources have been shifted to evaluate extended long-term storage of radioactive material. Efforts are being made to ensure the safety of extended spent nuclear fuel storage. U.S. NRC Chairman Greg Jaczko is confident in addressing policy issues related to regulating interim and extended spent fuel storage. The Commission is conducting a comprehensive review to identify regulatory improvements and policy changes for safe extended storage. The NRC is analyzing extended storage and transportation of radioactive waste until approximately 2250, totaling 300 years for the oldest waste. Funding for the Yucca Mountain repository has been a point of contention, with no allocation in the FY2012 and FY2013 budgets. The Commission is focused on ensuring safe long-term storage and transportation of spent nuclear fuel. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed funding for NRC and DOE for Yucca Mountain activities. Recent budget shifts at DOE and NRC will be analyzed for years to come. The Fukushima Dai-ichi incident has prompted a reexamination of SNF storage options. NRC established a task force to review regulatory requirements in light of the Fukushima Dai-ichi site. The task force delivered recommendations in July 2011 for SNF storage. The NRC task force has made specific recommendations for SNF storage safety, focusing on backup power reliability and monitoring capabilities. They have not found any issues that undermine confidence in plant safety, but are likely to recommend actions to enhance safety and preparedness. The options for SNF storage depend on how and where it is stored, as well as the management and oversight structure. The basis for determining reasonable storage options relies on assumptions and policy choices, especially the timeline for a permanent geologic repository. The report discusses the uncertainty surrounding the opening date of a disposal repository and the need for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). It mentions various factors that could impact SNF storage options, such as reactor license renewal, climate change, and technical developments. The two main storage options are wet storage pools and dry cask, with dry cask storage generally considered safer. The safety of wet storage pools is debated, while the added safety of dry casks is acknowledged. The report discusses the uncertainty surrounding the opening date of a disposal repository and the need for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). It mentions various factors that could impact SNF storage options, such as reactor license renewal, climate change, and technical developments. The two main storage options are wet storage pools and dry cask, with dry cask storage generally considered safer. The safety of wet storage pools is debated, while the added safety of dry casks is acknowledged. Wet storage pools provide radiological shielding and cooling for intensely radioactive SNF, while dry casks provide shielding and cooling for SNF discharged from reactors one to five years ago. Dry cask storage includes preparation for transportation to a repository or consolidated storage facility. The approval for transportation canisters for managing SNF storage using dry casks remains uncertain. The TAD program aimed to use sealed canisters for spent fuel assemblies from nuclear reactors until disposal in a deep geologic repository. Potential new fuels may require further review for extended storage. Some express concern about the safety of wet pool storage of SNF, but utilities continue to use it due to perceived safety, legal permission, and cost considerations. Operators aim to maximize wet storage before moving to dry casks to avoid unnecessary expenses. Shifting to dry cask storage is considered only when wet pool space is exhausted, following approved procedures. Shifting to dry cask storage is warranted to ensure safety and reduce risks associated with dense packing of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in wet pools. Concerns about the adequacy of protection in wet storage pools, especially after the Fukushima Dai-ichi disaster, have led to arguments for transferring SNF to dry casks as soon as it has cooled. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) considers SNF storage generally low risk if proper precautions are taken. The NRC believes both spent fuel pools and dry casks provide adequate protection for public health and safety. The National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council suggests that dry cask storage may have safety and security advantages over pool storage, especially in the event of a terrorist attack. The NRC may consider earlier transfer of fuel from pools to casks based on plant-specific vulnerability analyses. The NRC believes both wet storage pools and dry casks provide reasonable assurance of public health and safety. The NRC will continue to evaluate plant-specific assessments to determine if any changes to its spent fuel storage policy are necessary. NRC Chairman Greg Jaczko mentioned the difference between wet pools and dry casks in a recent interview. Greg Jaczko and another NRC official compared the safety of dry cask storage to wet pool storage, with differing opinions on the risks involved. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board stated that spent fuel can be safely stored in dry casks for short-term storage and transportation. Debate continues on the merits of wet pool storage versus dry casks, with arguments on the risks and safety of each technology. The Fukushima Dai-ichi plant experienced damage to wet storage pools inside reactor buildings due to hydrogen explosions and structural collapse, but the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) remained largely unharmed. Debate surrounds the safety of wet pool storage versus dry cask storage for SNF, with some advocating for transfer to dry storage after a cooling-off period. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has determined that transferring SNF to dry storage is not necessary. The NRC has determined that transferring spent nuclear fuel (SNF) to dry storage is not necessary for safety assurance. Additional monitoring and safeguards have been ordered for SNF storage, potentially increasing the shift from wet pools to dry storage. This shift could triple the amount of SNF in dry cask storage, requiring over 2,700 new dry casks. The NRC has determined that transferring spent nuclear fuel to dry storage is not necessary for safety assurance. A recent review by the NRC Office of Inspector General found that NRC lacks a consistent system for inspecting dry cask storage, which is expected to be the predominant method for SNF storage by 2025. The NRC is implementing improvements in the dry cask inspection program to ensure effective oversight and inspections. The Near-Term Task Force recommended enhancing spent fuel pool capabilities and addressing site blackout issues, with no immediate risk identified from continued operation and licensing activities. The staff review recommended deferring action on task force recommendations related to SNF management, considering alternative storage locations to reduce costs and improve safety. The most debated option is centralized storage for stranded SNF, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission. The current U.S. inventory of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is over 67,000 MTU and growing by about 2,000 MTU annually. Future SNF inventory levels depend on reactor operations, license renewals, and new reactor construction. A 1995 DOE study projected SNF storage to reach around 86,000 MTU by 2030 unless new reactors are built. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham cited security concerns post-9/11 as a reason to relocate high-level waste from reactor sites. The U.S. inventory of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is increasing annually, with current levels over 67,000 MTU. Security concerns post-9/11 have prompted discussions on relocating high-level waste to Nevada surface storage. The need for at-reactor storage of SNF for cooling before transfer to dry cask storage or transport is highlighted. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) allows for one consolidated interim storage facility with limited capacity, with concerns that interim storage could become permanent. The Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) recommends modifying the NWPA to allow for multiple storage facilities as needed. The Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) supports consolidated interim storage for nuclear waste, citing benefits such as reduced costs, improved safety, and increased confidence in nuclear power. This recommendation aligns with MIT's suggestion for centralized storage sites and the advice of the National Commission on Energy Policy to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act for interim storage and federal waste disposal responsibility. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's waste confidence rule is satisfied by interim storage and federal responsibility for waste disposal. Legislation proposed by Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mary Landrieu aims to establish up to two interim nuclear waste storage sites, with provisions to support DOE in paying local governments for hosting facilities. Concerns about consolidated interim storage include potential delays in finding willing host communities and the risk of storage sites becoming de facto repositories. Many agree on the need to consolidate storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from shut down facilities to reduce the number of storage sites and overhead costs. This consolidation could involve transferring SNF to new or existing storage sites, potentially adding new sites to the map. Wet storage may be temporarily needed before transferring SNF to dry cask storage. Consolidating SNF inventories helps reduce but not eliminate risks associated with multiple moves for transportation. Consolidating current inventories of SNF reduces the need for spent fuel at sites. SNF will continue to be stored at sites with operating reactors for cooling before moving. Moving SNF to a consolidation site reduces the number of sites needing security, potentially lowering storage costs. There may be some additional risk in transporting SNF to a consolidated site, but the US has experience in safely transporting SNF. Comparing risks and costs of storing SNF at reactor sites versus transferring to another location is necessary. The United States previously shipped nuclear materials, including weapons-grade uranium, with the expectation of return. Various options for management and oversight structures exist, involving government and quasi-governmental entities. Three federal agencies have been responsible for high-level nuclear waste management, including DOE, EPA, and NRC. Civilian SNF analysis has been transferred to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy after the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program. Various institutional structures and models have been proposed for management. Various institutional structures and models have been proposed to manage nuclear waste, including the establishment of a government corporation with a bipartisan board of directors. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a new federal corporation dedicated solely to implementing the waste management program. Some critics view the waste management program as the centerpiece of the BRC's recommendations but falling short of a market-based private SNF management system. Suggestions include using DOE nuclear weapons facilities for SNF storage and investing in new reprocessing technologies. The debate includes establishing a consolidated storage facility for commercial SNF at a DOE site like the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Consideration of federal government experience in operating disposal repositories and reprocessing efforts is recommended as Congress reviews alternative nuclear waste management structures. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) has been proposed as a solution for SNF storage and disposal, but studies have shown it to be not cost-effective and to pose environmental and nonproliferation concerns. While some advocate for further research on more efficient reprocessing technologies, current studies suggest that light water reactors using the once-through fuel cycle are the preferred option for the U.S. in the near future. Advocates for reprocessing emphasize the need for government-funded research rather than immediate deployment. The conclusion that spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is not currently viable as a cost-effective alternative to storage and disposal does not mean that viable processing technology could not be developed in the future. Concerns about proliferation policy impacts led to a halt in reprocessing by President Gerald Ford in the 1970s, which was later reversed. Currently, there are no plans for commercial reprocessing due to lack of commercial viability. Proponents advocate for government-funded research on new processing technologies. The Obama Administration and the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety support research into new spent nuclear fuel processing technologies to address waste management and proliferation concerns. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommends increased federal funding for the NRC to develop a regulatory framework for advanced nuclear energy systems to lower barriers to commercial investment. The nuclear industry emphasizes the need for NRC rulemaking to ensure successful licensing of new systems. The nuclear industry emphasizes the need for NRC rulemaking to establish a licensing process for spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. Despite concerns about wet pool storage safety, regulatory controls and economic incentives are believed to ensure safe storage. Dry cask systems are preferred for long-term storage due to cost advantages, with their use likely to increase compared to wet pools. The trend of increasing dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel is driven by cost advantages and a longer storage time horizon. The current situation may change if Congress adopts recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, including the potential for centralized consolidated storage sites. The Senate Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2013 includes provisions to fund efforts to implement these recommendations, such as a pilot program for consolidated interim storage facilities. Consent from state governors and local governments would be required for any consolidated storage site.
