    "content": "The service sector encompasses a wide range of economic activities that involve providing human value-added in various forms. These activities are intangible, cannot be stored, and must be consumed at the point of production. Examples of services include retail trade, transportation, information, banking, education, healthcare, and more. Services are becoming increasingly important in the U.S. economy. The service sector is a significant part of the U.S. economy, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP in 2010. Financial services are crucial for capital flow, delivery services ensure goods availability, and distribution services make goods accessible to consumers. U.S. trade in services plays a smaller role than trade in goods, accounting for 30% of total exports and 17% of total imports in 2010. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. This data provides a more accurate measurement of trade in services compared to cross-border trade data. The seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted more than a quarter century ago with the Trade Act of 1974 instructing the Administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Developing countries were initially reluctant to have services covered by international trade rules, but eventually, services were included as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations launched in 1986. During the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, services were included, leading to the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty highlights challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services, including targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing between legitimate and protectionist regulations, and adapting to technological advancements like the internet enabling tradable services. The GATS was created during the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986 to address challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services. It recognizes that most services transactions occur inside borders and barriers to trade in services are within customs barriers. The GATS divides modes of delivery into four categories, with concessions in opening up services markets being mode-dependent. The four modes of delivery are: Cross-border supply (mode 1) where the service crosses the border from one country to another. The GATS, created during the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, addresses challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services. It divides modes of delivery into four categories: Cross-border supply (mode 1), Consumption abroad (mode 2), Commercial presence (mode 3), and Presence of natural persons (mode 4). The GATS provides a multilateral framework of principles and rules for government policies affecting trade in services among 153 WTO members. The GATS preamble outlines its purposes and principles, including trade expansion for economic development, progressive trade liberalization, and member governments' right to regulate services. The GATS is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services. Part II presents principles and obligations that apply to all service sectors, emphasizing most-favored-nation treatment. The GATS establishes principles and obligations for member countries regarding trade in services, including non-discrimination, transparency, fair administration of rules, and market access. Exceptions include temporary restrictions for balance of payments difficulties and national security purposes. Market access and national treatment obligations are outlined in Part III of the agreement. The GATS establishes principles and obligations for member countries regarding trade in services, including non-discrimination, transparency, fair administration of rules, and market access. Part III of the agreement requires national treatment for service providers from other member countries and allows for negotiations to reduce barriers to trade in services. National treatment and market access obligations apply only to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments. The GATS includes technical elements like new negotiations to expand coverage, handling conflicts in dispute settlement, and annexes on various services sectors. Negotiations on financial and telecommunication services were ongoing. Negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery were ongoing. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with limited results, while negotiations on maritime services concluded in June 1996 without resolution. WTO members make commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors under the GATS. Each member must submit a schedule of commitments during negotiations, which is a key element of the Doha Development Agenda round. The Schedule of Commitments (SC) under the GATS is a detailed document that outlines market access and national treatment restrictions for different service sectors. It is divided into four columns, with the first listing the sector, the second and third detailing restrictions for each mode of delivery, and the fourth listing additional commitments. The SC is split into horizontal commitments that apply to all sectors and sector-specific commitments. WTO members must identify exceptions for each sector, making the SC a lengthy document. The negotiations on services in the DDA aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and reduce limitations on market access and national treatment. Article XIX of the GATS required WTO members to start new negotiations on services within five years of its entry into force. This involved resolving conceptual and procedural issues. The GATS mandates negotiations to address issues such as government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. The new services negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to political climate. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the negotiations, focusing on progressive liberalization of trade in services while recognizing members' right to regulate the sector. The negotiations under the GATS focus on the sovereign right of members to regulate the services sector and introduce new regulations. All service sectors and modes of delivery are subject to negotiations, with a deadline extended to the end of the DDA. Special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services are open to all WTO members, using a \"request-offer\" format for negotiating new commitments. Special attention is given to the needs of developing countries, with modalities adopted in 2003. Members also negotiate on how to give credit for autonomous liberalization in trade barriers on services. After a false start in Seattle, WTO members launched the DDA in November 2001. The Ministerial Declaration set deadlines for market access requests and offers. Services negotiations stalled, but a negotiating framework was agreed upon in July 2004 to revive the round. The July 2004 framework set deadlines for initial offers and revised offers in response to complaints about missed deadlines and low-quality offers. Services were briefly mentioned, signaling their importance to the U.S. business community. Negotiations on rules are conducted by working groups, with members using the request-offer format for national treatment and market access commitments. Each member submits a \"wish-list\" of commitments they want others to offer, followed by responses to these requests. The WTO services negotiations involve members making commitment offers in a request-offer format. Negotiations are conducted through bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral discussions. The process aims to reach consensus on acceptable commitments. The negotiations have faced delays and challenges, with the DDA negotiations being suspended in 2006 and resumed in 2007 due to disagreements on modalities for agriculture trade. The United States and chief trading partners have been negotiating in agriculture trade since 2007. Despite efforts to reach a consensus on basic objectives, they have not succeeded. The main goal for the U.S. is to secure market access commitments from trading partners, with a focus on liberalizing market access and national treatment commitments made during the Uruguay Round. The Uruguay Round market openness commitments were not as liberal as the existing market environment. The United States urges countries to raise binding levels to prevent slippage. Government regulation is prevalent in services trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. Service sectors are regulated by various government agencies at different administrative levels, requiring service providers to be aware of regulatory procedures. U.S. service providers face challenges due to lack of transparency in regulations in developing countries. The United States is pushing for WTO members to establish clear domestic procedures for licensing, inform the public about regulations, and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on foreign investment. Establishing a local presence is crucial for conducting business across various sectors. The United States is pushing for WTO members to eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment in various sectors, including financial services, insurance, telecommunications, and road freight transport. They are also requesting commitments to improve market access, transparency in regulations, and fairness in applying regulations. The United States is requesting increased market access and commitments from WTO members in various sectors, including express delivery services, energy services, and environmental protection services. They are also seeking third-party access to energy transportation facilities and increased access to markets for services related to wastewater treatment, waste management, and biodiversity protection. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services, including retail, wholesale, and franchising. They also seek access for higher education, training, and professional services like lawyers and accountants. Requests include removing citizenship requirements, ownership restrictions, and associations with local professionals. The United States has requested increased market access for computer and related services, including computer consulting, software development, data processing, and systems integration. They also seek improved market access commitments for audiovisual and advertising services. The U.S. presented initial and revised offers to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The U.S. defends its offers by stating that its services markets are already open and looks for WTO members to meet its standards. The United States offers horizontal commitments in various areas, including temporary entry of personnel, with specific groups allowed entry for limited durations. Some U.S. WTO-trading partners have reservations about these offers. The United States allows temporary entry for specific groups, such as fashion models and service providers in specialty occupations, as well as personnel engaged in business establishment and land acquisition. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed similarly to U.S. residents, with exceptions. The U.S. has offered commitments in sectors like business services, including professional, accounting, taxation, and architectural services, with exceptions mainly related to state restrictions on foreign service providers. The United States has offered commitments in various services sectors, including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, delivery services, telecommunications, retail trade, education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, transportation services, energy services, and construction. Developing countries have criticized the U.S. for not offering broader commitments, arguing that the sectors covered may not be useful to them. The European Union has criticized the United States for not offering to open maritime services and postal services to foreign competition. Developing countries and some developed countries have focused most of their criticism on U.S. commitments and offers under the mode-4 category of delivery. India argues for access for software specialists, computer experts, and information technology engineers. The negotiations for completing the DDA have been delayed, with deadlines for procedural steps rescheduled due to the complexity of the negotiations. Negotiators face challenges in the DDA negotiations, with the \"request-offer\" format causing a stall. The US and EU proposed \"benchmarks\" for targeted sectors, met with opposition from developing countries. Developing countries argue it's too late to change the negotiation format mandated for the DDA. Some developing countries are concerned that benchmarks in negotiations may favor sectors favored by developed countries. The US services business community worries that focusing on benchmarks could cause delays. Canada, supported by the US and other developed countries, proposed changes to jumpstart negotiations on services. The US suggested countries identify concessions before agriculture and non-agricultural negotiations are completed. Developing countries reject this proposal and want to maintain the current sequencing. The criticism of the approach to market access commitments in negotiations has been that it could hinder liberalization. The \"negative list\" approach preferred by the United States has caused controversy, particularly regarding mode-4 delivery of supply personnel. Developing countries have criticized the US on this issue, leading to tension between the US business community and government. The controversy surrounding mode-4 delivery of services in the US is criticized by developing countries, particularly regarding visa restrictions on temporary workers. India has called for more transparency and criticized the US for not offering more commitments in this area. The U.S. business community has urged for greater transparency in U.S. immigration regulations related to temporary entry of personnel, particularly in the context of mode-4 delivery of services. Congressional committees have objected to visa policy changes being included in trade agreements, emphasizing the need for separate consideration. The business community argues that flexibility in mode-4 offers is essential for successful negotiations with developing countries. Negotiations on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures in services have not made much progress. Developing countries, especially in East Asia, prioritize these issues but face challenges in resolving key questions. A World Bank assessment found that many WTO members, especially developing countries, have made limited changes to their commitments under the Uruguay Round, resulting in offers that are more restrictive than actual policies. The WTO members have been hesitant to lock in trade in services, preferring the option to apply more restrictions without violating commitments. Negotiations were suspended in 2006 due to disagreements among key members, and progress has been slow, especially due to the divide between developed and developing countries in the services sector. The halting progress in the agriculture and NAMA negotiations in the DDA has hindered services negotiations. Developing countries link their offers to reductions in agriculture subsidies by the US and EU. The complexity of services negotiations, with diverse economic activities and trade barriers, adds to the challenge. The prospects for the services negotiations at the WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in 2005 are uncertain. Factors such as political will, willingness to compromise, and resolution of agriculture and market access issues will determine the outcome. Trade ministers were expected to accelerate negotiations to conclude by the end of 2006. In the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, WTO members reaffirmed their commitment to complete the services negotiations by the end of 2006. Annex C provides modalities for the negotiations, but by 2007, countries were still divided on objectives. Developed countries wanted binding commitments on trade in services, while developing countries resisted without greater reductions in agriculture subsidies. WTO Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in 2008 to address these issues. The 2008 \"signaling\" conference aimed to gauge participants' offers and expectations in agriculture and NAMA negotiations. Little progress was made, with limited results from 2009 \"cluster\" meetings. Services negotiations in 2010 were hindered by reluctance to increase liberalization levels. Senator Grassley expressed concern over the stalled Doha services negotiations."
