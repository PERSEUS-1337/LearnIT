    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, such as Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern, potentially leading to regional and global proliferation consequences. Tensions between Israel and Iran could escalate into a wider conflict. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts for Israeli-Arab peace. While the image of the United States in the Middle East has improved under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy remains. Efforts like Muslim world outreach and attempts to close Guantanamo have not limited the influence of actors like Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and failures in the peace process between Israel and Palestine have reduced U.S. influence. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility in resolving disputes. The Middle East also faces challenges from the global financial crisis, poverty, inequality, unemployment, and water scarcity. Human rights violations and lack of democracy are common criticisms in the region. The United States advocates for economic and political reform in the Middle East to address challenges with democracy and human rights. Congressional considerations include responding to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to peace. Budget constraints raise questions on supporting regional initiatives like foreign aid, democracy promotion, and development assistance. Congress may need new tools to change the behavior of radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Policymakers must balance counterterrorism strategies to address vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. There is a growing international consensus to adopt stricter economic sanctions against Iran to compel it to compromise on its nuclear development. Measures by the UN Security Council, EU, and several countries complement US laws to curb Iran's alleged WMD programs and support for militant groups. The U.S. and major allies support sanctions targeting Iran's energy sector to isolate it from the international financial system. Efforts began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act, which penalizes foreign companies doing business with Iran's energy sector. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 expanded these measures to restrict Iran's gasoline imports and access to the U.S. market. The enactment of CISADA in response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 led to sanctions on Iran's energy sector by major economic powers, including the EU, Japan, and South Korea. These sanctions are impacting Iran's economy, with many international firms exiting the Iranian market. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties. U.S. foreign aid has played a significant role in strengthening these ties. Critics of U.S. aid policy, particularly in the Middle East, have raised concerns. Critics argue that U.S. aid to Israel exacerbates tensions in the Middle East by indirectly causing suffering to Palestinians. Congress and successive administrations have affirmed their commitment to strengthening Israel's security and maintaining its qualitative military edge. The Obama Administration requested $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel in FY2011, with a focus on co-research and development of missile defense systems as a potential issue for the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress may address U.S.-Israeli missile defense cooperation, with Congress appropriating funds for Iron Dome. Since 1948, U.S. aid has supported peace treaties and the peace process in the Middle East, deemed a national security interest by President Obama in 2009. The lack of peace has affected U.S. relations with countries in the Middle East and provided extremists with a cause. Calls for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to short-lived talks. Settlements remain an obstacle to negotiations, with Israel continuing activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Administration offered incentives for a settlement freeze but abandoned the effort in December. In December, the Administration abandoned efforts to halt Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Final status issues in negotiations include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role in U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel. Resolutions have been introduced to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy there. Appropriations legislation emphasizes Congress's commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Obama Administration maintains that Jerusalem is a final status issue for negotiation, while also requiring a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and conditions for a new Palestinian state. U.S. aid to the Palestinians supports combating terrorism, promoting stability in the West Bank, and meeting humanitarian needs in Gaza. Congress may provide additional assistance to Israel and the Palestinians in the event of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. U.S. aid policy towards the Palestinians during the 111th Congress has focused on self-governance, meeting humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip, and preventing destabilization. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza has averaged over $600 million, including direct budgetary assistance and security assistance for the Palestinian Authority. Additional humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees has been provided through UNRWA, averaging over $200 million annually since 2007. The Obama Administration notified Congress of proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion. The sales include fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, upgrades of existing aircraft, and related weaponry. The hope is that these sales will help sustain stability in the region. The Obama Administration notified Congress of proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion, including fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, and related weaponry. The proposed sales raise policy questions about regional security balance, effects on Israel's security, and strengthening Saudi Arabia vis-\u00e0-vis Iran. Concerns about human rights, terrorist financing, and religious extremism persist, while Saudi leaders remain wary of embracing Iraq's government and engaging Israel. In the 111th Congress, committees reviewed proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia, with concerns raised by 198 members of Congress. The Obama Administration aims to strengthen the U.S. military partnership with Saudi Arabia while preserving Israel's military edge. Additionally, there is an initiative to supply Israel with advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The 112th Congress may seek additional oversight of U.S. military training, arms sales, and counterterrorism cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The U.S. has been involved in training and arming the Saudi military since the 1940s, with ongoing support programs. Congress can block or modify arms sales, subject to presidential veto, even after the 30-day review period outlined in the Arms Export Control Act. New programs for Saudi security forces and infrastructure are also being implemented. The 112th Congress may focus on enhanced oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia and U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks on the U.S., including the failed bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009 and the attempted bombing of air cargo flights in 2010. Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue linked to AQAP, has been involved in radicalizing individuals to carry out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to combat terrorism. Options include using drones and placing military units under CIA control. Congress may assess the balance between counterterrorism efforts and stabilizing Yemen as it becomes a prominent battlefield against Al Qaeda-affiliated groups. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the United States providing an estimated $290 million in total aid in FY2010. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation's sustainability is a key question for lawmakers and policymakers, as disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists. Disagreements arise in Yemen over releasing alleged terrorists to appease tribal leaders and domestic politicians opposing U.S. involvement. Iraq's political system sees peaceful competition and attempts at cross-sectarian alliances, but infighting persists over key positions, delaying government formation. U.S. intervention in 2010 helped break the deadlock, leading to the agreement on senior government positions. However, the new government may struggle to reach consensus on major issues. The new government in Iraq is struggling to reach consensus on major issues, with concerns about U.S. influence waning and dominance by parties aligned with Iran. There are fears of conflict between the Kurdistan Regional Government and nationalist Arabs, contributing to uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis. Experts question whether stability will continue after the U.S. forces depart in 2011, with some warning of Iraq becoming a \"failed state\" without U.S. troops remaining. Iraqi Security Forces may not meet benchmarks by the end of 2011, raising concerns about the country's future. The U.S. government aims to secure a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq and define terms of security cooperation. Some Iraqi parties oppose this partnership, complicating efforts. The transition from military to civilian leadership in Iraq is underway, with a focus on expanding civilian personnel and economic assistance. Economic support to Iraq has decreased since 2003-2007, with $382.5 million in Economic Support Fund assistance in FY2010. The FY2011 request aimed to maintain this level of economic aid. The FY2011 funding for Iraq under the Continuing Appropriations Act aimed to maintain economic aid at the FY2010 level. Concerns persist about Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces. The transition to a civilian-led presence in Iraq provides new avenues for congressional oversight. Congress may review proposed arms sales to support U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention due to issues raised by diaspora communities, such as Greek-Americans and Armenian Americans. Congressional concern increased after Turkey's actions against U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and a violent confrontation with Israeli commandos. Legislation in the 111th Congress called on the Administration to urge Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.Res. 252, calling on the Administration to affirm the U.S. historical record on the Armenian genocide. The House also passed H.Res. 1631, which called for the protection of Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. Congressional interest in Turkey may focus on the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church, the genocide resolution, and potential defense appropriations for missile defense systems in Turkey. The 112th Congress may hold oversight hearings on possible political and policy changes in Turkey following the 2011 national election. U.S. policy towards Syria, including efforts to distance Syria from Iran, is also of interest. The Obama Administration sought to engage Syria diplomatically, sending high-level delegations and easing some sanctions. Critics argue that despite these gestures, U.S. sanctions against Syria have remained in place since 2009. The Obama Administration's shift in tactics towards Syria includes applying more pressure on the Syrian government to play a constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. This change comes after two years of unsuccessful attempts to engage Syria diplomatically and restart Israeli-Syrian peace talks. There is renewed international concern about Lebanon due to Hezbollah's threats to destabilize the country. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions against the Asad regime, while some lawmakers advocate for continued U.S. engagement with Syria. Lawmakers introduced H.R. 1206, the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act, to impose sanctions on those aiding Syria's access to weapons of mass destruction and investing in its energy sector. There is debate over confirming Robert S. Ford as Ambassador to Syria, with supporters arguing for increased U.S. presence and opponents viewing it as a concession to the Syrian regime. Current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the unity government, limit Iranian and Syrian influence, and contain Hezbollah. The United States has provided economic and military assistance to Lebanon since Syria's withdrawal in 2005. The U.S. supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. Prime Minister Hariri's government faces challenges due to pending STL indictments and increased sectarian tension. Hezbollah rejects potential indictments, leading to questions about U.S. support for Hariri and the STL. Hezbollah's escalating rhetoric and Hariri's changing statements may affect the government's legitimacy. The United States has provided economic and military assistance to Lebanon since Syria's withdrawal in 2005. Prime Minister Hariri's government faces challenges due to pending STL indictments and increased sectarian tension. Any changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance, especially if Hezbollah gains more power. The U.S. Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for foreign assistance to strengthen the Lebanese state and deter non-state actors. In August 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli unit near the Blue Line, resulting in casualties. Some members of Congress halted funding for Lebanon over concerns about U.S. equipment use against Israel, but the hold was lifted after consultations with the State Department. The incident in Lebanon raised questions about future U.S. assistance. The 112th Congress may support a more democratic government in Egypt. Egypt is a key partner for the U.S. in regional affairs and the Arab-Israeli peace process. Political liberalization in Egypt could have a ripple effect in the Middle East. Some prefer a stable, autocratic Egypt for U.S. interests, fearing the Muslim Brotherhood's rise to power. In the November and December 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats. The State Department expressed concerns about election irregularities, including disruption of opposition campaigns and interference by security forces. Congress has provided Egypt with $1.5 billion in aid annually, with funding for democracy promotion as a possible tool for reform. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial, with the Egyptian government opposing foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform. US aid towards democracy and governance activities has decreased over the years, with $25 million allocated in FY2010. Some analysts suggest the Obama Administration may de-emphasize democracy assistance to ease tensions with Egypt. Some critics argue that U.S. funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been ineffective and should be redirected to areas that have a more immediate impact on the daily lives of Egyptians. There are calls for U.S. aid to be conditioned on improvements in Egypt's human rights and religious freedom record. Despite efforts to combat Al Qaeda since 9/11, the organization and its affiliates remain a persistent threat, with operatives determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities. Recent events indicate that Al Qaeda supporters are using the Internet for sophisticated ideological outreach. Al Qaeda supporters are conducting sophisticated ideological outreach online, promoting independent, low-cost operations. This trend complicates counterterrorism efforts by spreading Al Qaeda's ideology widely and making threats less predictable. U.S. policymakers face dilemmas in the Middle East as they balance counterterrorism goals with other strategic priorities. The costs, benefits, and limits of sustained military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have been demonstrated over the past decade. Al Qaeda continues to criticize U.S. military presence in the region despite ongoing withdrawals from Iraq. Limited operations against Al Qaeda figures persist. The ongoing withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq has raised concerns about limited operations against Al Qaeda and counterterrorism assistance programs. U.S. support for democratic reform in countries like Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank has faced criticism for empowering Islamist parties. Despite increased outreach to Muslims, public opinion polls show skepticism towards U.S. intentions. Some suggest a more direct approach to destroy Al Qaeda, while others advocate for a containment strategy. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy through hearings and legislation like the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009. The 112th Congress may further evaluate U.S. strategy and engagement with Muslim countries, including maintaining partnerships in Iraq and defeating Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy, including defeating Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel, securing counterterrorism cooperation in the Gulf, and peace between Israel and its neighbors. Relevant Congressional Research Service Reports on Iran sanctions, preserving Israel's military edge, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process were also highlighted.
