    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating scientific and technological breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing processes. Nanotechnology is expected to have a significant positive impact on security, economic well-being, and health in the United States. To maximize these benefits, the U.S. must maintain world leadership in nanotechnology despite competition from other nations. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the U.S. in 2003. To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the United States must invest in educating students in secondary schools and higher education to conduct research and develop nanotechnology applications. This Act aims to strengthen the capacity of schools and institutions by providing grants for necessary tools and training for students and teachers in nanotechnology careers. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which likely defines key terms related to nanotechnology. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to nanotechnology, including \"eligible institution\" as a school offering advanced science courses, \"institution of higher education\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as specialized equipment. The curr_chunk defines \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the US with at least 50% US materials. The curr_chunk authorizes a program. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to provide grants to eligible institutions for teaching nanotechnology. Grants can be used for equipment, software, educational services, faculty development, and teacher education. The National Science Foundation will provide grants to eligible institutions for teaching nanotechnology, with limitations on fund usage for software, educational services, and teacher education. Applications must be submitted to the Director for eligibility, with funds only allowed for undergraduate programs in community colleges or higher education institutions. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting grant applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Eligible institutions will be selected based on geographic diversity, with a focus on historically Black colleges, minority institutions, and institutions in participating states. The Director may not award a grant to an eligible institution under this Act unless the institution agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount. The matching requirement can be waived for institutions with no or low endowment. If a branch or institution receives a grant over $100,000 under this Act, they are not eligible for another grant until 2 years later. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Institutions receiving grants must submit a report on fund usage within a year. The Director reviews these reports annually and evaluates the program every third year. A report to Congress with recommendations is submitted six months after each evaluation. The program under this Act requires ongoing Federal support as needed. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
