    "content": "Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states that the President receives a set salary of $400,000, with an additional $50,000 allowance for official expenses. Any unused allowance reverts back to the U.S. Treasury. Upon leaving office, the President receives a pension equal to the salary for Level I of the Executive Schedule. The President's salary is set by the Constitution at $400,000 with an additional $50,000 allowance for expenses. Any unused allowance goes back to the Treasury. The salary has been adjusted five times since 1789, with the most recent increase in 1999. In 1949, Congress passed legislation to increase the salary to $100,000 per annum, a $25,000 increase from the previous rate. In 1949, Congress passed legislation to increase the President's salary to $100,000 per annum, a $25,000 increase from the previous rate. Senator Herbert O'Conor provided a brief history of the proposal during Senate consideration of S.103, which had been developed over 1 \u00bd years by a subcommittee appointed in July 1947. The bill represents the best judgment of the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the executive branch. The Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries recommended increasing the President's salary from $100,000 to $200,000 in 1969. Congress passed H.R. 10, and President Johnson signed the bill into law on January 17, 1969, with the salary increase effective when Richard Nixon was inaugurated on January 20, 1969. Speaker John McCormack emphasized the urgency of increasing the President's salary before noon on January 20, 1973, to ensure the next President could benefit from it during their term. This action was discussed with key leaders and committee members to meet the deadline. During consideration of H.R. 10 on January 6, 1969, House Majority Leader Carl Albert emphasized that the legislation to increase the President's salary was initiated by Members of Congress, not the President. Senator Hiram Fong expressed the need for thorough discussion by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service before passing the bill on January 15, 1969. The Committee on Post Office and Civil Service should thoroughly discuss the proposed legislation to increase the President's salary. The salary was increased to $400,000 per annum when Congress passed H.R. 2490, signed into law by President Clinton on September 29, 1999. The House Subcommittee on Government Management held a hearing on the matter on May 24, 1999, with various individuals testifying. Several high-ranking officials and public interest groups supported a substantial increase in the President's salary to reflect the prestige of the office. The Congressional Accountability Project opposed the increase, citing concerns about raising the salaries of other top officials. No legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress to increase the salary of President Barack Obama, and no legislation has been introduced for the President taking office in 2013.
