FINDINGS.\"\n\nSummarized: Section 1 presents the findings. \"Congress finds that Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, born in 1919 in Georgia, was a standout athlete at UCLA before becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball in 1947. He won the National League's Rookie of the Year Award in his first season and was later voted the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1949. Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\" Jackie Robinson's achievements extended beyond athletics to influence civil and human rights in America. He was the first black player in Major League Baseball, gaining rapid popularity for his fortitude, integrity, and athletic ability. Robinson later became vice president of Chock Full O' Nuts and co-founded the Freedom National Bank of Harlem. Jackie Robinson's legacy extends beyond athletics as he co-founded the Freedom National Bank of Harlem and influenced political leaders. He worked with various organizations to improve the lives of Americans and his principles are upheld by the Jackie Robinson Foundation, providing educational opportunities for low-income families. His personal achievements have had a lasting positive impact on civil rights in the United States. The President is authorized to present a gold medal to Jackie Robinson's family in recognition of his contributions. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike the medal with suitable emblems. Duplicates in bronze may be sold to cover costs. The medals are considered national medals. Authorization of appropriations is granted. SEC. 5. Authorization of Appropriations: Up to $30,000 from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund is authorized for the medal cost. Proceeds from bronze medal sales will go to the Fund. SEC. 6. Sense of Congress: Congress suggests a national day to honor Jackie Robinson's achievements, with the President issuing a proclamation. This was passed by the Senate on October 17, 2003. A congressional gold medal is to be awarded posthumously to Jackie Robinson for his contributions to the Nation. Congress also suggests a national day in recognition of him."
