    "content": "The Housing Trust Fund (HTF), administered by HUD, provides formula funds to states for affordable housing activities. Established by HERA in 2008, it focuses on rental housing production. Funds must benefit low-income households, funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was created in 2008 with funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Initially, there were concerns about the GSEs' finances, leading to a suspension of contributions to the HTF. In 2014, contributions resumed, with $174 million transferred to the HTF in 2016. HUD allocated funds to states for affordable housing activities. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was established in 2008 with funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many states and localities have their own housing trust funds, providing dedicated funding for affordable housing activities. Real estate transaction fees are a common funding source. Nearly 700 state, city, and county housing trust funds have been created in 47 states. Prior to the federal HTF, advocacy groups pushed for a national affordable housing trust fund. In 2008, the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was established with funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Advocates wanted new resources for affordable housing activities at the national level, separate from existing federal programs. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) created the HTF and the Capital Magnet Fund, with dedicated funding sources to avoid annual appropriations uncertainties. The Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund were established in 2008 with funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Contributions were suspended for several years, but the Housing Trust Fund received its first funding in 2016. Both funds are funded through contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises chartered by Congress to provide liquidity in the mortgage market. They set aside 4.2 basis points for each dollar of unpaid principal balance for new business purchases. The Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund were established in 2008 with funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Contributions were suspended for several years, but the Housing Trust Fund received its first funding in 2016. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac set aside 4.2 basis points for each dollar of unpaid principal balance for new business purchases. Contributions are divided with 25% going towards ongoing costs of the Hope for Homeowners program, 65% to HUD for the Housing Trust Fund, and 35% to Treasury for the Capital Magnet Fund. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prohibited from passing the costs of the contributions on to mortgage lenders. The Federal Housing Finance Agency can suspend contributions if it finds they are contributing to financial instability or preventing successful completion of a capital restoration plan. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship under FHFA due to financial concerns. The Treasury provided support through senior preferred stock purchases. Contributions to affordable housing funds were suspended until 2014 when FHFA directed the GSEs to set aside funds. This was lifted in 2015 due to profitability, with funds required to be transferred within 60 days. In 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were directed to contribute to affordable housing funds within 60 days. Some praised the decision for more affordable housing, while others criticized it due to concerns about the GSEs' financial status. FHFA stated that contributions may be suspended if needed, and HUD published rules for the Housing Trust Fund in 2009 and 2010. The Housing Trust Fund program requirements were published by HUD in 2010 and an interim rule in 2015. The program administers GSE contributions for formula grants to states, DC, Puerto Rico, and insular areas based on factors like shortage of affordable rental units for low-income households. The Housing Trust Fund program administers formula grants to states based on factors like shortage of affordable rental units for low-income households. The grant amount is determined by factors such as the ratio of low-income renter households with housing challenges in a state compared to all states, multiplied by the relative cost of construction. HUD has discretion in weighting these factors. In its interim rule, HUD prioritizes housing for extremely low-income households in the formula factors for awarding grants from the Housing Trust Fund. States receive a minimum annual grant of $3 million, with HUD providing an alternative method if funding is insufficient. States designate an entity to administer the funds, which can be a housing finance agency or another qualified instrumentality. Subgrantees, including state agencies or local units, can also administer the funds. Grantees and subgrantees must submit plans to HUD detailing the distribution of Housing Trust Fund funds to recipients, who must have relevant experience in affordable housing projects. The Housing Trust Fund provides grants for affordable homeownership housing, down payments, closing costs, and interest rate subsidies. Recipients need financial expertise and must meet certain income criteria. States primarily use the funds for rental housing but can assist first-time homebuyers. The focus is on extremely low-income families, with funds used for grants, equity investments, and loans. Housing standards must be met for quality, accessibility, and energy efficiency. The Housing Trust Fund provides grants for affordable housing, with at least 80% of funds allocated for rental housing activities. Grantees can use up to one-third of their annual grant for operating assistance, but there are concerns about potentially shifting funds away from rental housing production. The Housing Trust Fund allows recipients to use up to one-third of funding for operating costs. Up to 10% of a state's grant can be used for owner-occupied housing expenses. Home buyers must be first-time buyers and complete financial counseling. The assisted housing must be \"modest\" and have resale or recapture provisions. The Housing Trust Fund allows recipients to use up to one-third of funding for operating costs. Recapture provisions allow for the sale of the house if not used as a principal residence during the affordability period. HTF funds cannot be used for political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling services, or travel expenses. All funds must benefit extremely low-income or very low-income households. HUD sets a 10% limit on administrative costs for program funding. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) sets income limits for households, with VLI households defined as having incomes no higher than 50% of area median income. HUD requires that at least 75% of HTF funds benefit ELI households or those below the poverty line. HTF-assisted housing must meet affordability requirements, including maximum rents and affordability periods. HUD specifies usage requirements for HTF funds based on total funding provided. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) sets income limits for households, with VLI households defined as having incomes no higher than 50% of area median income. HUD's interim rule specifies maximum rent limits for HTF-assisted rental units based on income levels. Some advocates argue that rents should be based on tenants' actual incomes rather than a percentage of area median income to prevent hardships for extremely low-income households. HUD notes that there is no separate source of appropriated funds for operating assistance for HTF units. Fixed rents are deemed necessary for underwriting and financing rental developments using HTF funds. HTF-assisted housing must remain affordable for a specified period of time, with rental housing required to remain affordable for 30 years. States or state-designated entities must develop allocation plans for distributing grant money from the Housing Trust Fund. The allocation plan for distributing grant money from the Housing Trust Fund must describe state's housing needs, distribution of funds, performance goals, and public comment consideration. Grantees must detail geographic distribution, prioritized populations, program requirements, and subgrantee funding in their plans. Subgrantees receiving HTF funds must submit allocation plans consistent with the state's plan, detailing priority factors and population segments. Grantees and HUD oversee fund usage, with states responsible for proper fund use and reimbursement for misuse. Improperly used funds will result in reduced future grants unless repaid. Grantees must inspect HTF-assisted properties at completion and periodically for rental housing, maintain records, and monitor subgrantees for compliance. Grantees and subgrantees must submit annual performance reports to HUD detailing HTF fund usage and compliance. HUD reviews grantees' performance annually and can take actions for noncompliance, including withholding funds or terminating assistance. HTF funds must be committed within two years and spent within five years, or they will be recaptured by HUD. The GSEs began contributing to the HTF in 2015, with funds transferred in 2016. In early 2016, $174 million was transferred to the Housing Trust Fund, reflecting a required sequestration of mandatory spending. HUD announced state formula allocations in May 2016, with most states receiving a minimum of $3 million. Fifteen states received higher allocations, with California receiving the largest at $10 million. Current issues related to the Housing Trust Fund are discussed, including arguments for and against it, the status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, legislative proposals for additional funding, and proposals to limit funding. The national affordable housing trust fund has been a controversial topic, with supporters advocating for it to address a shortage of affordable housing for low-income households. Opponents have raised concerns about funding and potential uses. Supporters argue that the fund is necessary to produce rental housing affordable to those with the lowest incomes, as there is a shortage of such housing units. Most federal affordable housing programs aim to make existing housing more affordable for low-income households through rental assistance. However, current funding is insufficient to serve all eligible households, with only a quarter of low-income rental households receiving assistance. Programs supporting housing production for low-income households may not reach extremely low-income individuals, and competition for funds may limit the production of rental housing. For example, the LIHTC program develops rental units for households with incomes at or below 50% or 60% of the area median income, while the HOME program must benefit eligible households. Opponents have concerns about the Housing Trust Fund, arguing that it duplicates existing federal funding for affordable housing programs like the HOME program. They also raise issues about funding being provided outside of the normal appropriations process. Some critics argue that rental housing activities funded by the Housing Trust Fund should be subject to congressional oversight through the appropriations process. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of funds for lobbying or political activities. There is also criticism of requiring contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the housing funds while they are still under government conservatorship and have not fully repaid Treasury for past financial support. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under government conservatorship, have agreements with Treasury allowing them to draw funds if needed. The capital buffer they can hold decreases yearly, potentially leading to drawing funds from Treasury. If they do so, contributions to the Housing Trust Fund would be suspended for that year. Discussions on reforming the housing finance system aim to reduce the government's exposure to mortgage-related losses. This includes considering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's support for affordable housing and the Housing Trust Fund. In the 113th Congress, different housing finance reform bills were proposed in the House and Senate. The House's PATH Act would have phased out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without a government guarantee, abolishing the Housing Trust Fund. The Senate's Johnson-Crapo bill would have also phased out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but included federal reinsurance on eligible mortgage-backed securities, retaining the Housing Trust Fund with contributions from a fee on securities. In the 114th Congress, no comprehensive housing finance reform legislation has been considered by committee. However, the Housing Trust Fund is likely to be part of the debate regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's status in the future. Affordable housing advocates have searched for new sources of funding for the Housing Trust Fund, including contributions from the GSEs and proposals for changes to the mortgage interest deduction. In the 114th Congress, bills like the Common Sense Housing Investment Act and the Pathways out of Poverty Act aim to provide funding to the Housing Trust Fund by making changes to the mortgage interest deduction. The Ending Homelessness Act of 2016 proposes $1 billion per year in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund has received funding from various sources in previous Congresses, including the general fund of the Treasury and funds related to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). However, no funding for the Housing Trust Fund has been included in annual appropriations acts or enacted legislation to date. Some in Congress criticize the fund as duplicative or express concerns about its funding mechanism. Some in Congress have concerns about the Housing Trust Fund's funding sources and its potential for misuse. Bills have been introduced to limit funding from government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) while in conservatorship. For example, the Pay Back the Taxpayers Act of 2015 would prohibit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from funding the Housing Trust Fund while in conservatorship. The FY2016 HUD appropriations bill proposed diverting funding to the HOME program instead. The Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 aims to address these issues. The Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 (H.R. 4913) aims to end the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requiring them to rebuild capital. Contributions to the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund would be suspended until a certain capital threshold is reached. Several bills in previous Congresses aimed to eliminate the Housing Trust Fund, but none were enacted. Prior to the enactment of HERA, legislation was introduced multiple times to establish a national affordable housing trust fund. Funding sources considered included using a portion of receipts from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, diverting FHA receipts would have a cost, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seen as potential funding sources due to their special relationship with the federal government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from private lenders, guarantee payments, and package them into securities overseen by a federal regulator. There was debate over requiring them to contribute to affordable housing funds, with opponents citing shareholder interests. In 2008, HERA created the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund funded by the GSEs. Table A-1 summarizes previous legislation for a national housing trust fund, including funding sources. HUD announced state allocations from the Housing Trust Fund in 2016, with most states receiving a minimum allocation of $3 million. Puerto Rico and insular areas were not subject to the minimum allocation."
