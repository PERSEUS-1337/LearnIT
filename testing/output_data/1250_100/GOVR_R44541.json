Financial institutions can be involved in TBML schemes when used to settle international trade transactions. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment reports highlighted the challenges of investigating trade-based money laundering (TBML). TBML schemes can launder billions annually, with over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) detailing potential TBML activities totaling $276 billion from 2004 to 2009. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers use the international financial system and cash couriers to conceal their activities within the complex trade and finance system. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves complexities in foreign exchange transactions, co-mingling of funds, and limited resources for detection. Money launderers exploit vulnerabilities in financial arrangements like letters of credit to obscure the money trail. TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing goods and services, a common method to shift funds across borders. Over- and under-invoicing in trade transactions involve shifting funds between exporters and importers by manipulating the value of goods or services. Collusion between parties is necessary for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and supply chains make it difficult for customs officials to determine the true market value. Multiple invoicing of goods and services can be used by money launderers to justify multiple payments and increase transaction complexity. Money launderers can increase transaction complexity by over- and under-shipping goods and services, manipulating prices, and misstating quantities or descriptions. They may also engage in the Black Market Peso Exchange scheme to launder drug proceeds from Latin America. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) emerged as a major money-laundering method used by Colombian drug traffickers in the 1980s to disguise billions in narcotics profits. TBML is a common form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations, with potentially significant consequences for global trade and government revenue. ICE HSI warns that transnational criminal organizations may sell imported goods bought with illicit funds at a discount to expedite the money laundering process. Illicit proceeds are used to sell goods at below-market prices to expedite money laundering, creating a barrier to legitimate businesses. This activity robs governments of tax revenue and reduces duties collected on undervalued imports. Global trends in trade have been exploited by criminal organizations to hide gains from illegal activities, expanding their operations into new markets. According to a report by the OECD, criminal organizations are diversifying into global markets to reduce risks and exploit new opportunities for illicit trade. This poses challenges for law enforcement and could have economic consequences, especially in developing countries. Criminal groups are adapting to global market trends to connect production with distant consumers and exploit the international trade system with low risk of detection. According to FATF and FinCEN, the international trade system is vulnerable to illicit exploitation due to factors such as the high volume of trade flows, complex foreign exchange transactions, comingling of illicit funds with legitimate business, limited verification procedures, and resources for customs agencies. TBML activity is increasing globally, with Mexico, China, and Panama being key locations for such illicit transactions. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 annual report on money laundering and financial crimes, TBML concerns have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Venezuela, and others. TBML is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, corruption of customs authorities, exploitation of free trade zones, and laundering of proceeds from black market goods. The Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment stated that physical movement of cash and movement through the banking system are the predominant methods for moving money to terrorists. Anecdotal case studies have shown instances of terrorist groups using trade-based money laundering, but it is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. The State Department identified trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, involving hawala brokers and corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking presence, relying on trusted money brokers. Unregulated hawala systems are quick and cost-effective but lack transparency, making them vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 annual report on money laundering and financial crimes identified specific countries vulnerable to trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing schemes. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme using trade in vehicles, sometimes with weapons, to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States, where vehicles are purchased and exported to Lebanon and Jordan with weapons hidden inside. The ultimate destination of these vehicles is unknown. States appear to be legitimate, but the ultimate destination of the vehicles is unknown and the proceeds may be directed back to Hizballah in Lebanon. TBML schemes have long prevailed in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area with Brazil and Argentina, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money-laundering purposes, enriching criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes might support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern, with Hezbollah deriving financial support from drug and money laundering schemes involving TBML. The Lebanese Canadian Bank facilitated money laundering schemes involving wire transfers for used car purchases in the US and BMPE-styled schemes with Asian consumer goods in Latin America. Ultimately, LCB's banking license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to another Lebanese bank. In the late 2000s, owners of Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. The cash deposits were placed into the company's bank account in small amounts to avoid reporting requirements. The toy company used the cash to purchase toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. Some employees of Woody Toys had connections to Angel Toy Company, implicated in a similar scheme. The investigation into the case benefited from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. A scheme in the early 2000s involved laundering funds through cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms managed by an Indian national in Dubai. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates worldwide, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other locations. The individual used his businesses' connections with banks to transmit LCs to exporters in India, arranged bogus trade documents with inflated values, and remitted funds along with drug trafficking proceeds. The money was moved through the financial system disguised as trade financing. Additionally, he facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying documents and using hawala operators to settle the difference in values. U.S. government policy responses to address TBML include participation in combating such activities. The U.S. government's response to trade-based money laundering (TBML) includes participation in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to develop AML/CFT guidelines and regulatory responses by the Treasury Department. FATF, with 34 member countries, sets out measures to combat money laundering and can suspend non-compliant members. The Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to FATF. The U.S. delegation led by TFFC plays a key role in advancing global efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing at the FATF. The delegation includes members from various U.S. government departments and implements actions domestically to meet U.S. commitments to the FATF. In 2012, FATF members adopted revised recommendations to include CFT guidelines and the financing of weapons of mass destruction in their surveillance efforts. The revised FATF recommendations aim to address evolving criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and support global efforts to raise standards. The new standards focus on higher-risk situations, transparency requirements for beneficial ownership, and control of legal entities to combat various types of criminal activity. However, specific recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering (TBML) are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. The FATF has identified a lack of comprehensive data on trade-based money laundering (TBML) and the need for specific training programs to detect TBML activities. Recommendations include developing training programs focused on financial and trade data analysis to identify trade anomalies and criminal activities. FinCEN plays a central role in combating TBML through advisories, geographic targeting orders, and special measures in jurisdictions identified as primary money laundering threats. FinCEN issues advisories on trade-based money laundering (TBML) to assist financial institutions in detecting suspicious activities and filing SARs. The advisories highlight TBML schemes, red flags, and the importance of reporting suspected TBML. In 2014, FinCEN updated its advisory to address increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts after restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. A funnel account is an account that receives multiple cash deposits below reporting thresholds in one area and withdraws funds in another area quickly. FinCEN uses Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to combat criminal activity, imposing recordkeeping requirements on financial institutions for up to 180 days. GTOs have been used to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML), with one issued in 2015 lowering cash reporting thresholds. In 2015, FinCEN issued Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) targeting Miami-based electronics exporters and Los Angeles Fashion District businesses. The GTOs required reporting any cash transactions over $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by drug and transnational crime organizations. The orders aimed to frustrate drug traffickers exploiting the fashion industry for illicit activities. The U.S. has the jurisdiction to impose regulatory special measures against foreign entities involved in money laundering schemes. These measures can range from enhanced due diligence requirements to prohibiting certain types of accounts. FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as institutions of primary money laundering concern due to their involvement in a large-scale trade-based money laundering scheme. The U.S. designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a large-scale TBML scheme. U.S. authorities claim they were linked to an international narcotics trafficking and money laundering network associated with Hezbollah. Homeland Security Investigations established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to identify instances of TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. Funding from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs supports the establishment of TTUs in various countries. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy established attacking TBML as a national goal and called for the deployment of ICE-led TTUs to exchange and analyze trade data. The State Department reports an increase in TBML investigations from TTU activity, with over $1 billion seized. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security in Latin America, as well as in general hearings on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing policies. Witnesses have raised concerns about the effectiveness and challenges of combating TBML. The 114th Congress has been focused on combating trade-based money laundering (TBML) and its links to terrorist financing, particularly concerning Hezbollah. In December 2015, the Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. The Treasury Department's national risk assessments on money laundering and terrorist financing have downplayed the relationship between terrorism and TBML, but policymakers remain concerned about these links. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 requires reporting on Hezbollah's financing operations, including the use of TBML. OFAC issued a final rule in April 2016 to implement the Act. President Obama committed to imposing sanctions on Hezbollah. The Treasury Department aims to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools to address TBML. The 114th hearing discussed trade-based money laundering (TBML) in various committees, including the House Armed Services Committee and House Financial Services Committee. Topics included stopping terror finance and investigating terrorism financing streams from South America. The curr_chunk provides information on various committee hearings related to terrorist financing trends, preventing cultural genocide by ISIS, the international financial system, defense authorization requests, and helping the developing world fight terror finance. The curr_chunk lists committee hearings related to terrorist financing, including topics such as trade-based money laundering, kidnapping, and immigration enforcement policies. The curr_chunk provides a list of committee hearings related to border security, terrorism financing, and immigration enforcement policies.
