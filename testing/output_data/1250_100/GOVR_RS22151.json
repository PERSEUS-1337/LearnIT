    "content": "In the 109th Congress, two proposals have been introduced to regulate .50 caliber rifles more strictly. The Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons Regulation Act of 2005 (S. 935) and the 50 Caliber Sniper Rifle Reduction Act (H.R. 654) would both amend the National Firearms Act to regulate these weapons, with H.R. 654 aiming to eventually eliminate them from civilian possession. H.R. 654 and S. 935 propose stricter regulations on .50 caliber rifles, defining them as rifles capable of firing .50 caliber ammunition. The proposals do not include compensation for rifles handed over to the government. Critics argue that the definition is too broad and could cover rifles not considered \"sniper rifles.\" The .50 BMG caliber round is a large cartridge used in heavy machine guns, but long-range .50 caliber rifles have gained popularity in recent years. In the early 1980s, .50 caliber rifles gained popularity among firearms enthusiasts, leading to the formation of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association, Inc. (FCSA) in 1985. The .50 caliber BMG cartridge was developed after WWI as a heavy machine gun cartridge, adopted by the U.S. Army in 1923. The cartridge has a projectile weight 4.5 times greater than a .308 Winchester cartridge and holds five times more propellant. It has a maximum effective range of 2,000 yards and a muzzle velocity higher than the .308 Winchester. The .50 caliber BMG round has a maximum effective range of 2,000 yards, a muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet per second, and a muzzle energy of 12,000 foot-pounds. It provides increased accuracy and knock down power, capable of hitting targets at long ranges. The M-107 Long Range Sniper Rifle, adopted by the U.S. Army, is a semiautomatic rifle with a 10-round magazine and attached optics/electro-optics scope for all weather, day/night tactical dominance. The rifle can use a variety of ammunition types such as incendiary, armor piercing, and tracer rounds. The M-107 rifle is capable of delivering various types of ammunition for engaging material targets at extended ranges. It weighs about 32 pounds and costs $14,833 per unit. The government contractor, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Company, produces .50 caliber rifles for the general public, ranging in price from $2,800 to $6,750. Armor piercing/incendiary rifle ammunition has been banned for resale in the civilian gun market for the past six years. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act bans the resale of military surplus .50 caliber ammunition unless demilitarized. Gun control advocates warn of potential terrorist use of .50 caliber rifles for deadly scenarios like downing aircraft or penetrating armored vehicles. The National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 regulate firearms at the federal level, with some states having stricter laws. Congress may consider stricter regulations for .50 caliber rifles due to their potential destructiveness. The National Firearms Act of 1934 regulates \"concealable\" firearms known as \"any other weapon,\" including those favored by gangsters during the prohibition era. The Act imposes taxes on manufacturing/importing and requires registration of these firearms and their owners. The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the NFA's scope to include destructive devices and redefined certain firearms categories. The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the National Firearms Act's scope to include destructive devices and redefined certain firearms categories. It also authorized the Attorney General to reclassify certain firearms as \"collectors items\" and increased penalties for violating the NFA. Additionally, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986 prohibited the possession of machine guns not legally possessed before May 19, 1986, effectively limiting the number of machine guns available to the general public in the United States. The NFA requires the Attorney General to maintain a central registry of NFA firearms and owners in the US, delegated to the ATF Director. The NFA Branch manages the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (NFRTR) database, containing firearm details and owner information. Possessing or transferring an unregistered NFA firearm is a felony with severe penalties. To deal in NFA firearms, one must be a federal firearms licensee (FFL) and a special occupational taxpayer (SOT) under the NFA, categorized as Class one SOTs (importers), Class two SOTs (manufacturers), or Class three SOTs (dealers). NFA firearms are often known as Class three weapons. The NFA imposes a $200 manufacturing tax and a $200 transfer tax each time a firearm changes hands. ATF places a tax stamp on the approved transfer document. Private persons can acquire NFA firearms through various ways, including transfer approval, making and registering, or inheritance. Congress could consider options for dealing with long-range .50 caliber rifles, such as registration under the NFA, banning production for civilian market, or taking no action. Congress could take several actions regarding long-range .50 caliber rifles, such as banning their production for the civilian market, setting ballistic performance standards, or recalling existing ammunition. Additionally, options include banning these firearms outright and compensating owners for turning them over to the government."
