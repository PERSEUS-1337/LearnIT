Proper management of debris is crucial for residents to return to a safe environment. Communities aim to divert debris from landfills through recycling, burning, or composting to avoid overburdening landfill space. Improper debris management can have long-term negative effects, especially when hazardous constituents are mixed in during or after a disaster. Improper disposal of household hazardous waste or sewage can contaminate personal property or building materials, leading to future environmental and health problems. This report discusses federal and state waste management requirements for debris removal after disasters, highlighting the roles of agencies like FEMA, the Corps, and the EPA in providing assistance. Federal waste management standards are crucial for managing debris quickly and safely. Federal waste management standards, established under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, give EPA primary authority to regulate hazardous solid waste under Subtitle C. Non-hazardous and excluded wastes are regulated under Subtitle D, with states having primary authority to enforce standards related to open dumping prohibition. Disaster debris, created after natural or man-made disasters, typically falls under Subtitle D regulations. Disaster debris, including vegetative debris, rotting materials, damaged vehicles, and hazardous chemicals, is managed by local or state agencies after a disaster. The waste is typically reduced through burning, recycling, chipping, or composting before disposal in a landfill. EPA and the Corps may provide assistance, but the state ultimately decides on debris management. After a disaster, state agencies face challenges in managing disaster debris quickly and safely to prevent risks to human health and the environment. Factors like the overwhelming volume of debris and improper disposal practices can make it difficult to manage. The common categories of disaster debris and associated challenges are listed in Table 1. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 produced 118 million cubic yards of debris over a large area. Managing large amounts of debris after a disaster can be challenging, requiring coordination for removal, sorting, and disposal. States aim to reduce costs by reusing and recycling waste, but limited space and finding qualified haulers can be obstacles. Debris management after disasters can be challenging due to the large volume of waste. Safe disposal options depend on separating hazardous constituents from non-hazardous waste. Burning or chipping vegetative debris can reduce volume significantly, but contaminated debris may not be suitable for these methods. Residents returning to disaster areas may oppose burning due to smoke concerns. Chipping or reusing vegetative debris contaminated with sewage, oil, or other contaminants may not be safe options. C&D waste, not classified as hazardous or municipal solid waste under federal law, is disposed of in landfills without federal criteria. States determine C&D landfill criteria and may broaden the definition in emergencies. Hazardous materials are typically removed before landfill disposal to reduce costs and burden on disposal facilities. EPA recommends this practice. The safe disposal of disaster debris is crucial to prevent hazardous materials from contaminating landfills. Residents may be eligible for federal funding for debris removal if they move it to a public right-of-way. Separating different types of debris is essential for efficient management. Residents' ability to return and assist in cleanup affects the speed of rebuilding efforts. The safe disposal of disaster debris is crucial to prevent hazardous materials from contaminating landfills. Residents may be eligible for federal funding for debris removal if they move it to a public right-of-way. Separating debris at a staging area or disposal facility is time-consuming, costly, and potentially dangerous. Federal debris removal assistance is commonly provided in accordance with the Stafford Act, which sets forth a process for requesting emergency or major disaster declarations. The process for a governor to request and the President to declare an \"emergency\" or \"major disaster\" when an event exceeds state and local response capabilities. The presidential declaration authorizes federal agencies to provide assistance, including debris removal support. The National Response Framework outlines guidelines for federal agencies to respond to disasters, organizing capabilities into 14 Emergency Support Functions. The ESFs provide coordination for federal response to incidents, including debris removal missions under ESF #3 and ESF #10. FEMA, the Corps, and EPA play roles in supporting local or state government's debris removal activities, with FEMA providing funding and approving federal assistance. Federal funding for disaster-related debris removal is coordinated and provided by FEMA primarily through its Public Assistance (PA) Grant Program. FEMA provides grant assistance to reimburse state, tribal, and local governments and certain types of private nonprofit organizations for their response and recovery efforts. To be eligible for PA funding, the debris removal work must be required as a result of the disaster event, located within a designated disaster area, and the legal responsibility of an eligible applicant. Eligible activities must be in the public interest and include eliminating immediate threats to lives, public health, and safety, significant damage to property, ensuring economic recovery of the community, and mitigating risks to life and property by removing damaged structures. The FEMA hazard mitigation program allows for the conversion of acquired properties to open space, recreation, or wetlands management. If local or state governments lack the capability for debris removal, they can request federal assistance. FEMA may assign another federal agency, such as the Corps or EPA, to assist with debris removal through a \"mission assignment.\" The Corps typically provides debris removal assistance after receiving a mission assignment from FEMA. The Corps may be assigned by FEMA to remove disaster debris from various locations and provide technical assistance for debris removal contracts. They coordinate landfill and burn sites, train debris monitors, and ensure proper management of contaminated debris. Additionally, the Corps is responsible for maintaining navigable channels and waterways. The Corps is authorized to develop projects for debris removal from federally maintained commercial harbors and adjacent areas, remove obstructions from waterways under emergency conditions, and assist with debris removal from flood control works. EPA responds to incidents involving oil or hazardous materials to protect public health and welfare, following the National Contingency Plan. EPA may also assist in managing hazardous wastes if requested by local or state agencies. The EPA may assist with locating proper sites for debris disposal, managing contaminated debris, and monitoring debris management methods to ensure they do not pose risks to human health or the environment. They work with federal agencies like the Corps and Coast Guard to facilitate waste collection and disposal. State environmental agencies may issue their own declarations of emergency after disasters to specify debris removal operations. After disasters, state environmental agencies may issue declarations of emergency to specify debris removal operations. Each state can implement its waste management program, including decisions on debris handling and disposal sites. Local agencies provide permits for debris removal activities and oversee classification, disposal methods, and landfill selection. Proper pre-disaster planning is crucial to manage large volumes of mixed debris effectively. FEMA emphasizes that communities with a plan in place are better prepared to restore public services and ensure public health and safety. FEMA encourages governments to establish a Debris Management Plan (DMP) to manage debris efficiently after disasters. The plan must identify likely incidents, types of debris, and relevant laws. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 added Section 428 to the Stafford Act, allowing alternative procedures for FEMA's Public Assistance program. The law directed FEMA to adopt alternative procedures to reduce costs, increase flexibility, expedite assistance, and provide incentives for debris removal activities. Section 428 allows FEMA to fund debris management planning and provide incentives for state, tribal, or local governments to prepare a FEMA-approved DMP. Currently, FEMA is implementing debris-related alternative procedures through pilot programs authorized until June 27, 2018. Aspects of disaster debris removal: FEMA's Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide provides guidance on debris removal issues and requirements. Additional resources include FEMA's Debris Management Guide, Debris Removal and Demolition Fact Sheet, and Alternative Procedures. The Army Corps of Engineers also offers information on debris management. EPA's Planning for Disaster Debris and a CRS report on FEMA's Public Assistance Grant Program are valuable resources for Congress. \"FEMA's Public Assistance Grant Program: Background and Considerations for Congress, by Jared T.
