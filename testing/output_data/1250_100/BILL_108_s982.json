The Syria Accountability Act of 2003 highlights findings regarding Syria's support for terrorist groups, despite being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism and prohibited from receiving US assistance. The Act aims to address the discrepancies in sanctions applied to Syria compared to other state sponsors of terrorism. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command have offices, training camps, and facilities in Syrian territory, operating in Lebanon areas occupied by Syrian forces and receiving supplies from Iran through Syria. UN Security Council Resolution 520 calls for respect of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Over 20,000 Syrian troops occupy Lebanese territory, influencing its government and undermining its independence. Multiple bills have been passed since 1990 calling for Syrian forces to withdraw from Lebanon. Large numbers of Lebanese people are calling for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanon. Israel has complied with UN Resolution 425, but Syria allows attacks on Israeli outposts and civilian targets. Syria prevents Lebanon from deploying troops to southern Lebanon, leading to Hizballah controlling the Israeli-Lebanese border and southern Lebanon. The United States provides $40,000,000 in assistance to Lebanon through NGOs, with $7,900,000 going to Lebanese-American educational institutions. President George W. Bush vows to work with allies to prevent terrorists from obtaining weapons of mass destruction. Syria is developing ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, violating UN resolutions. Syria has been importing 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil daily since 2000, violating UN sanctions and providing Iraq with up to $1.2 billion annually. Reports suggest Syria is developing chemical weapons and harboring fugitive Iraqi officials. President Bush mentioned positive signs of Syria cooperating on the issue of harboring fugitives in April 2003. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress is that Syria must immediately stop supporting terrorism, declare renunciation of terrorism, close terrorist offices, withdraw armed forces from Lebanon, and cease development of weapons. The Sense of Congress is that Syria should cease the development and production of biological and chemical weapons, halt illegal imports of Iraqi oil, enter into peace negotiations with Israel, and the US should provide assistance to Lebanon through appropriate channels until full political independence is achieved. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The United States policy holds Syria accountable for supporting terrorist groups like Hizballah, denying them the ability to engage in terrorism or acquire weapons of mass destruction. Syria will remain listed as a state sponsor of terrorism until it stops supporting terrorist groups and complies with international laws. Restoring Lebanon's sovereignty is a priority for US national security interests. Syria is in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 520 by occupying Lebanese territory and threatening its independence. The US will restrict assistance to Syria until it withdraws from Lebanon, stops developing weapons of mass destruction, and complies with relevant resolutions. Syria must comply with relevant resolutions regarding missiles. SEC. 5. PENALTIES AND AUTHORIZATION. Sanctions will be imposed on Syria if the President does not make a certification. This includes prohibiting the export of defense articles, defense services, and certain items to Syria. Additionally, sanctions may include prohibiting the export of US products (excluding food and medicine), restricting US businesses from investing in Syria, and limiting the travel of Syrian diplomats. Sanctions on Syria include restricting travel of Syrian diplomats in the US and UN, reducing US diplomatic contacts with Syria, and blocking transactions involving Syrian government property in the US. The President can waive these sanctions if it's in the national security interest and provide a report to Congress. Additionally, assistance to Syria and Lebanon can be authorized. The President is authorized to provide assistance to Syria and Lebanon under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 if certain conditions are met, including progress in peace negotiations and Syria's respect for Lebanon's sovereignty. The President must certify these determinations to Congress. The President must certify to congressional committees that Syria meets specific conditions, including not supporting terrorist groups, withdrawing from Lebanon, halting missile development, and complying with UN resolutions. SEC. 6. REPORT.\n\nThe Secretary of State must submit a report every 12 months on Syria's progress towards meeting specified conditions and any connections between terrorists in Syria and attacks against the United States. The report will be unclassified but may include a classified annex. SEC. 7. DEFINITION OF APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives."
