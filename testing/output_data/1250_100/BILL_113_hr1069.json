    "content": "The Act is titled the \"TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act\" and includes a drug screening and testing program for applicants and recipients of assistance under state TANF programs. The TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act includes a requirement for states to operate a drug testing program for applicants and recipients of assistance. The program involves screening and testing individuals for illegal drug use and those at high risk of substance abuse. The TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act mandates states to conduct drug screening and testing for applicants and recipients of assistance. States must screen individuals for illegal drug use and may continue testing them at random intervals. The TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act requires states to screen individuals for substance abuse using an effective survey method. Individuals receiving assistance must be tested for illegal drug use to determine if further evaluation is needed. The TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act mandates screening for illegal drug use after the 3rd month of receiving assistance. If deemed high risk, individuals must undergo drug testing. The Secretary cannot waive these provisions, and illegal drugs are defined as controlled substances. If assistance is denied, support for other family members must continue. The amendments made by this section regarding protective or vendor payments for the benefit of family members shall take effect one year after the enactment of the Act, with a possible delay if state legislation is required. The Act requires compliance with requirements before the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter following the close of the State legislature's regular session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session."
