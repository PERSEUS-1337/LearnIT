    "content": "The 2008 farm bill expanded on renewable energy policies established in the 2002 farm bill, which included an energy title. Interest in renewable energy has increased due to rising petroleum prices and biofuels production. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel receive federal support. The 2008 farm bill, enacted after the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, reflects the increased role of biofuels in the U.S. agriculture sector. It includes provisions for expanding the renewable fuels standard, with a focus on cellulosic ethanol production. Concerns about economic and environmental issues related to corn starch-based ethanol are also highlighted. Ethanol production has led to competition with petroleum in the marketplace, with nearly 40% of U.S. corn production used for ethanol in 2010. The increase in corn used for U.S. ethanol has drawn down corn stocks and driven up prices. Ethanol's profitability depends on petroleum and corn prices, with rising petroleum prices increasing demand for ethanol and corn. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate due to food price inflation. Federal programs supporting renewable energy production, like the RFS, originated outside the farm bill. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expanded federal tax credits for biofuel blenders and introduced new programs to support biofuels production. It includes a distinct energy title (Title IX) covering various biofuels such as corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. Research provisions are in Title VII, while tax and trade provisions are in Title XV. The bill maintains the structure of Title IX from the 2002 farm bill, with 3 sections focusing on biofuels. The 2008 farm bill expanded federal tax credits for biofuel blenders and introduced new programs to support biofuels production. Key provisions include a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production, grants and loan guarantees for biofuels research and production, studies on market and environmental impacts of biofuels use, and support for rural energy efficiency. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives and support for the production of advanced biofuels, mainly cellulosic. Programs include grants and loan guarantees for new technologies and infrastructure, support for cellulosic feedstock production, and assistance for advanced biofuels refinery construction. Increased funding for advanced biofuels research is also included. The 2008 farm bill energy title supports advanced biofuels research and development, including cellulosic ethanol production from various agricultural feedstocks like prairie grasses and woody crops. Cellulosic feedstock offers environmental benefits over corn-based ethanol and is not yet produced on a commercial scale. Cellulosic ethanol production has been slow, leading the EPA to reduce RFS mandates for 2010-2012. Tax credits and tariffs on ethanol, including a $1.01 per gallon producer credit for cellulosic ethanol, aim to promote investment. Ethanol blender tax credit was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in 2009. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to the end of 2010 by the farm bill. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended both the ethanol blender tax credit and the import tariff for ethanol until the end of 2011. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies. This includes studies on biofuels, biomass crop assistance, and biorefinery expansion. Over $1 billion in funding is authorized for these programs from FY2008 to FY2012. The 2008 farm bill includes mandatory funding for various energy programs, totaling over $1.7 billion, with significant increases compared to the 2002 farm bill. The Biorefinery Assistance Program receives the largest increase in funding. Mandatory funding is provided through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, while discretionary programs are funded annually through the appropriations process. The research title examines selected energy programs' funding levels for FY2010 through FY2012, as requested by the President and authorized in the 2008 farm bill."
