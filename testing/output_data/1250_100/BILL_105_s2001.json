    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998\". In 1988, Congress enacted a demonstration program under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to test direct billing for health services provided to patients eligible for reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid. The program showed increased collections and reduced turnaround time for payments. The demonstration program under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act tested direct billing for health services provided to eligible patients, resulting in increased efficiency and success for tribes and tribal organizations managing their own billings and collections. This approach is more beneficial than the current system managed by the Indian Health Service, allowing for reduced administrative costs and aligning with the Indian Self-Determination Act. The demonstration program under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act tested direct billing for health services, resulting in increased efficiency for tribes and tribal organizations. Congress extended the program to avoid interruption while awaiting a recommendation on its permanency. It would benefit the Indian Health Service and Native organizations to make the program permanent and expand participation to other tribes and health organizations. Direct billing of Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors is addressed in Section 3. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is amended to establish a program for Indian tribes to directly bill and receive payment for health care services under the Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is amended to allow Indian tribes to directly bill and receive reimbursement for health care services under the Medicare and Medicaid programs without certain restrictions. Participating hospitals or clinics will be reimbursed directly for services provided, with excess funds used for facility improvements. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act allows Indian tribes to bill and receive reimbursement for health care services under Medicare and Medicaid. Participating hospitals and clinics will be reimbursed directly, with excess funds used for facility improvements. The program will be subject to auditing requirements and secretarial oversight, including quarterly reports on performance. The program requires hospitals and clinics to submit quarterly reports during the first 2 years and annual reports thereafter. No payments from special funds are allowed for participating hospitals or clinics. Participation requirements include submitting an application. To participate in the program, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Alaska Native health organization must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating that they contract for a Service facility, which is eligible for Medicare or Medicaid, meets Service program requirements, and is accredited or has a plan for accreditation approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall review and approve qualified applications within 90 days, unless criteria are not met. Participants in the previous demonstration program are automatically approved. Approval or deemed approval will remain in effect as long as accreditation is maintained. The Secretary will examine and implement necessary changes for direct billing and reimbursement under the program, including agreements with States for Medicaid billing. Participants must provide consistent medical records information to the Service. The program participants must provide consistent medical records information to the Service. Accounting information required for reporting in the program can be changed by the Secretary after consultation with participants. Participants can withdraw from the program in a manner similar to tribes retroceding a contracted program under the Indian Self-Determination Act. All cost accounting and billing authority will be returned to the Secretary upon withdrawal. The program participants can withdraw from the program, and all cost accounting and billing authority will be returned to the Secretary upon withdrawal. Amendments to the Social Security Act allow certain Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill for health care services provided by their hospitals or clinics. The amendments made by this section, allowing certain Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health organizations to directly bill for health care services, will take effect on October 1, 1998."
