The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" establishes a demonstration program for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries to purchase qualifying health benefits coverage and access a Medi-Choice card for out-of-pocket health care expenses. Qualifying health benefits coverage must be comprehensive for dual eligible beneficiaries. The Act ensures that Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries in California receive comprehensive benefits under parts A, B, and D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the State Medicaid plan under title XIX. Coverage must be as comprehensive for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries as of the enactment date, with guarantee issue and no preexisting condition exclusions. The coverage under the demonstration program is guaranteed issue without preexisting condition exclusions. Premiums are uniform and do not vary based on age, health status, or other characteristics. SEC. 3. MEDI-CHOICE CARD. The Secretary will contract with a credit card provider to issue Medi-Choice cards for purchasing health benefits coverage and covering out-of-pocket costs for eligible beneficiaries. Unused amounts on the card can be used for qualified medical expenses until expended. Eligible beneficiaries can use Medi-Choice cards for purchasing health benefits coverage and covering out-of-pocket costs during the demonstration program.

Eligible beneficiaries can use Medi-Choice cards for purchasing health benefits coverage and covering out-of-pocket costs during the demonstration program. Unused amounts on the card can be used for qualified medical expenses until expended. SEC. 4. ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES. In this Act, an eligible beneficiary is a legal permanent resident of the United States within the program area, eligible for medical assistance under the State plan or entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Exclusions include individuals enrolled in certain programs, imprisoned, or non-lawful permanent residents. In this Act, a Medicare eligible beneficiary is described as an eligible beneficiary under subsection (a)(2)(B), while a Medicaid eligible beneficiary is described under subsection (a)(2)(A). A dual eligible beneficiary is someone who qualifies as both a Medicare eligible beneficiary and a Medicaid eligible beneficiary. SEC. 5. Funding of Medi-Choice cards. The Secretary will provide funds through the Medi-Choice card for dual eligible beneficiaries based on the average value of medical assistance and benefits under Medicare. For other Medicaid eligible beneficiaries, the annual deposit amount will be determined separately. The annual deposit amount for dual eligible beneficiaries is based on the United States average nominal dollar value of medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act for 2012, with subsequent years adjusted for inflation. For other Medicare eligible beneficiaries, the annual deposit amount is based on the United States average nominal dollar value of benefits under parts A, B, and D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act for 2012, with subsequent years adjusted for inflation. The payment amounts under subsection (a) are adjusted for individual risk factors, with a methodology specified by the Secretary. For higher-income individuals, the annual amount under subsection (a)(2) is reduced by one percent for each percent of excess income, not to exceed a 50 percentage point reduction. Any computed amount not a multiple of $12 is rounded to the nearest multiple of $12. Annual inflation adjustments for Medi-Choice cards are based on the consumer price index and medical care component projections. Monthly deposits are credited on a prorated basis for partial months of program enrollment. SEC. 6. SCOPE OF DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The program will be conducted in specific California counties for 10 years, starting June 1, 2013, with a limit of 100,000 beneficiaries at any time. SEC. 7. PAYMENT OF COSTS. The Secretary is responsible for operating the demonstration program and covering costs, including Medi-Choice card deposits. Costs for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries will be paid from respective trust funds or appropriations. No duplicate payments will be made under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act. The Secretary provides assistance in enrollment for eligible beneficiaries in the demonstration program, offering a toll-free phone number and information on plan options. Amounts paid into a Medi-Choice card are not considered as income and do not affect eligibility for federal programs. Participants are not responsible for premium payments under Medicare or Medicaid but must use benefits for qualifying health coverage. Individuals in the program are not entitled to Medicaid payments. The Act states that individuals are not entitled to Medicaid payments for items and services covered under the Act. Medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act continues for noncovered items like dental, vision, or long-term care services."
