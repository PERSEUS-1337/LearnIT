In 2008, their capital proved inadequate during the financial crisis, leading to government intervention to support the mortgage markets. The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. Treasury and the Federal Reserve have provided support by purchasing MBS and preferred stock. Some bills aim to reduce the enterprises' size and increase their costs, potentially impacting mortgage prices and interest rates. Several legislative proposals in the 112th Congress aim to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These proposals include increasing regulatory oversight, disclosure, and capital requirements, as well as setting deadlines for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved. Additionally, there are provisions for replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship under the FHFA due to financial difficulties. They provide mortgage money indirectly to homeowners by purchasing mortgages from lenders and packaging them into MBS. The enterprises back almost half of the nation's home mortgages. The Obama Administration's report presents three broad alternatives for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the housing finance system. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement these proposals. More details can be found in CRS Report R41719. The report continues with summaries of legislation introduced in the 112th Congress, addressing various concerns such as executive compensation. H.R. 31, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require the director of FHFA to make quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, mortgage fraud prevention efforts, and underwriting standards. The bill H.R. 31 requires the FHFA director to make quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, focusing on various aspects such as executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation, and underwriting standards. The reports will be reviewed by the FHFA inspector general and shared with Congress, with a focus on loss mitigation policies and the impact of principal reduction on financial conditions and foreclosure rates. Additionally, the bill mandates the posting of reports and comments on the FHFA website. The Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 31, forwarding it to the full committee. The bill emphasizes oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with provisions for quarterly reports to Congress and review by the FHFA inspector general. H.R. 463 aims to subject the enterprises to FOIA requests, while H.R. 1221 seeks to limit executive pay at the enterprises. The bill aims to regulate executive compensation for enterprises covered by TARP provisions. It would remove FHFA's discretion in rejecting salaries and require enterprises to charge guarantee fees reflecting mortgage risk. FHFA could phase in higher fees over two years or impose them at a higher level after two years. The House Subcommittee marked up H.R. 1222, giving FHFA authority to implement provisions related to guarantee fees. H.R. 1223 aims to treat mortgage-backed securities equally and not base risk determinations solely on enterprises' role in securitization. Regulators, including the SEC, HUD, and FHFA, are working on joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS under Dodd-Frank. QRMs would be exempt from this requirement. H.R. 1223 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises, with concerns raised about enterprises' risk retention. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that the enterprises' guarantees may not satisfy the risk retention requirements, but proposed rules could allow for this under certain conditions. H.R. 1224, the GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. The financial support agreements between Treasury and the GSEs require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce their mortgage portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. H.R. 1224 and companion bills aim to reduce the enterprises' portfolios on a similar schedule, with potential for FHFA to order faster reductions. H.R. 1225, GSE Debt Issuance Approval Act of 2011, would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to seek permission from the Secretary of the Treasury before issuing new debt. The Secretary would announce the decision in writing after a seven-day waiting period. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up the bill and forwarded it to the full committee. The Secretary already has this authority according to the enterprises' charters. H.R. 1226, GSE Mission Improvement Act, aims to repeal affordable housing goals set by previous acts and eliminate funding for housing trust and capital magnet funds. FHFA must report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and rural area loans. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises forwarded the bill to the full committee for consideration. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would restrict FHFA from approving new products for enterprises in conservatorship or receivership unless necessary to preserve assets or reduce losses. H.R. 2425, Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, would prohibit GSEs from purchasing mortgages registered with MERS, a system bypassing state registration laws. Laws require local registration of mortgages and liens on real estate. MERS faces legal challenges regarding its authority in foreclosures and ownership history. Employment contracts may cover legal expenses. Proposed bills aim to regulate legal expenses, prevent dividend rate reductions, and empower FHFA to revoke charters during receivership. H.R. 2441, 2440, and 2462 are bills aimed at terminating housing funds, identifying non-mission critical assets, and capping GSE bailout support. FHFA would sell assets, protect personal data, and set limits on Treasury support for enterprises. The Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPA) provide financial support to enterprises, with the possibility of additional support if needed. Treasury purchased preferred stock initially limited to $100 billion per GSE, later raised to $200 billion each. Amendments in 2009 allowed unlimited support in 2010-2012, with $200 billion limits outside of those years. Various companion bills in Congress have different provisions for the enterprises, with some aiming to replace them. H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413 aim to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 408 and S. 178, titled the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, address various issues beyond GSE reform. Title VI of these bills would end the enterprises' conservatorships in 24 months. After conservatorship, the enterprises would either be dissolved or continue under revised charters, with changes including reducing portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. Housing goals would no longer apply. H.R. 1226 focuses on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, proposing that they leave conservatorship within 24-30 months. After returning to stockholder control, their charters would be repealed for new business, leading to a 10-year wind-down period before dissolution. The bill also includes provisions for FHFA to enforce minimum capital levels and sets a nationwide conforming loan limit of $417,000 with no high-cost exceptions. The enterprises under H.R. 1226 would have restrictions on mortgage purchases based on median home prices, with minimum downpayments of 5%, 7.5%, and 10% over time. They would need to pay all state and local taxes, register stocks with the SEC, and be charged for government benefits. Another pair of bills, H.R. 1182 and S. 693, includes similar provisions with a guarantee fee increase. H.R. 1182 and S. 693 propose guarantee fee increases, portfolio reductions for enterprises, repeal of affordable housing goals, and various other provisions such as ending conservatorship in 24 months, phasing out charters for new business, lowering conforming loan limits, increasing minimum capital requirements, and raising borrower downpayment requirements. H.R. 1859, Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011, authorizes FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. Associations would guarantee timely payments to investors with a backup guarantee from the federal government. They would specialize in specific markets and have a maximum mortgage size based on national or area median prices. The curr_chunk discusses the proposed changes in mortgage limits for Honolulu and San Jose, regulations on mortgages for single-family dwellings, the creation of a federal corporation for purchasing and securitizing mortgages, and the fees associated with this facility. Additionally, it mentions the winding down of enterprises and the requirement for them to pay state and local taxes. The proposed changes include charging guarantee and reinsurance fees for purchasing mortgages to keep market share under 50%. Fees would cover mortgage payments during normal times and compensate Treasury for federal guarantee. Eligible mortgages are for 30 years or less, up to 80% of the sales price (or 90% with seller participation or private insurance). FHFA would oversee the facility."
