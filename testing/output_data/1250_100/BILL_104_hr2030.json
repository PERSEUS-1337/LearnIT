    "content": "The \"Parental Choice in Television Act of 1995\" allows parents to choose television programming for their children. The Congress finds that television has a significant influence on children's values and behavior, with some children exposed to up to 11 hours of TV a day. Studies show that exposure to violent programming can lead to aggressive behavior and the acceptance of violence as normal. Children in the United States are exposed to a high number of murders and acts of violence on television. Studies show that the casual treatment of sexual material on TV affects children's attitudes and behavior. Parents are concerned about violent and sexual video programming and support technology to block harmful content. Empowering parents to limit negative influences of video programming on children is a compelling governmental interest. Providing parents with information and tools to block harmful programming is essential. The government aims to empower parents to restrict harmful video programming for children by establishing a Television Rating Code. This code includes rules to identify and rate programming containing sexual or violent content that parents should be aware of before it is shown to children. The code also requires distributors to transmit signals with ratings for parental guidance. The government is implementing regulations to enable parents to block inappropriate video programming for children by requiring TVs to have circuitry to block certain channels and programs based on their rating. This includes apparatus with screens 13 inches or larger, manufactured or imported for use in the US. Additionally, regulations are being amended to ensure TVs with blocking capabilities are shipped or imported. The government is implementing regulations requiring TVs to have blocking technology for inappropriate content. This includes rules for shipping, manufacturing, and importing TVs with blocking capabilities. The Commission will oversee industry standards for blocking technology. The Commission will ensure that blocking service remains available to consumers as new video technology develops. Amendments to the Act include adding new sections for compliance with rating provisions on video programming containing sensitive material. The effective date for these changes will be determined after consultation with relevant stakeholders. The Federal Communications Commission will require television manufacturers to display ratings on programming for children and agree to broadcast signals with ratings. The effective date for these regulations will be determined after consultation with the television manufacturing industry."
