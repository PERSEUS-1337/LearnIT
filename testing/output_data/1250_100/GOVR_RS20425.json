Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite television services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS also provides satellite channels through a service called Voom. SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via their satellite dishes, including rebroadcasting local network signals. The SHVIA allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals back into the same local market area. The distinction between local and distant network signals is important, with local signals being received within a network television affiliate's local area, and distant signals coming from elsewhere in the country. The original SHVA established the \"Grade B\" contour to determine eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite. Consumers inside the Grade B contour were not allowed to receive such signals, while those outside (in \"white areas\") were allowed. Some satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to court challenges. In 1998, Miami judge decisions led to over 2 million consumers having their distant network signals terminated by satellite companies. EchoStar appealed to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. The 1999 law \"grandfathered\" illegal signal receivers if they couldn't get a Grade A signal. New subscribers must meet Grade B intensity requirements to receive distant network signals. The FCC confirmed the Grade B standard in 1999. Consumers can seek waivers if they believe they are not receiving the required signal strength. Consumers may seek a waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite by applying to their satellite company. The local network affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test at no cost to them. Exceptions apply for recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and large \"C-band\" users. The SHVIA permits consumers using RVs, commercial trucks, or \"C-band\" satellite dishes to receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from the local affiliate. \"C-band\" dish users can receive signals indefinitely if received before October 31, 1999. DBS companies may provide local broadcast TV signals to consumers in the designated market area, but it is not mandatory. The SHVIA allows consumers using RVs, commercial trucks, or \"C-band\" satellite dishes to receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from the local affiliate. DBS companies are not required to provide local broadcast TV signals in the designated market area, but must carry all local TV stations in a market if they choose to provide any local station. The must carry provisions for DBS went into effect on January 1, 2002, and as of October 2004, EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services in various markets across the United States. EchoStar reported that 83% of the population could receive its service when it passed the 100 designated market area (DMA) mark. DirecTV aims to provide local-into-local in at least 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, covering 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure that small and rural areas without access to local-into-local services can still receive local television through other technologies. Compensation for copyright on programming is also an issue for satellite carriers under the 1988 and 1999 laws. Under the 1988 and 1999 laws, satellite carriers were granted compulsory copyright licenses for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals, with government-set prices. The 1999 law extended the license for distant network signals until 2004. The 108th Congress is considering further extension and price changes. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. The 2002 law extends syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication rules to satellite retransmission of superstations. It allows subscribers affected by a 1998 court decision to continue receiving distant network signals until 2004. The Grade B signal intensity standard is maintained for receiving distant network signals. Consumers can request waivers from local affiliates for doubtful signal strength. C-band satellite customers can keep receiving distant network signals from before October 31, 1999. The 2002 law extends copyright compulsory licenses for satellite signals, reduces royalty payments for distant network and superstation signals, eliminates waiting period for cable subscribers, and allows national PBS feed until 2002. Loan guarantee program for local-into-local provisions was deleted due to objections by Senator Gramm. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed as part of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. It created a board to select recipients for loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion to build systems for local television signals. The board considers serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. The act is technology neutral and places limits on eligible cable companies. Regulations for the program can be found on the Board's website. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003. An application period ended in April 2004, with one incomplete application received. The Board voted to return the application and open another 60-day application period, which was later rescinded in July. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its reports. The FCC selected an independent entity to conduct tests on terrestrial systems operating in the same frequency band as DBS satellites. The MITRE Corporation concluded that MVDDS systems could co-exist with DBS with mitigating techniques, causing differing reactions from DBS operators and Northpoint Technology. The FCC decided to auction frequencies instead of allowing companies like Northpoint to provide MVDDS. Northpoint objected and did not participate in the auction, which raised $118.7 million. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band."
