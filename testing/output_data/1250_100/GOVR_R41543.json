    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held hearings on natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. The United States has become a leader in the shale gas revolution, with improved extraction methods significantly increasing production. The United States has increased natural gas production through shale formations, leading other countries to follow suit. The development of unconventional natural gas resources will determine if natural gas plays a larger role in the global economy. With its growing resource base and lower carbon emissions, natural gas is likely to have a greater impact on the world energy mix. In 2015, the United States consumed over 27,463 bcf of natural gas, the most of any country. U.S. consumption grew by 3%, driven by rapid growth in unconventional natural gas reserves and production, particularly shale gas. Shale gas now makes up 51% of U.S. proved reserves and 56% of production, leading to a potential shift from a net importer to a net exporter. Global natural gas consumption reached 122,442 bcf in 2015, with the U.S. accounting for 22.8% of global consumption. Russia was the second-largest consumer, using 13,820 bcf. In 2015, Russia's natural gas consumption declined by 8% due to a weak economic environment, despite accounting for 53% of the country's total primary energy consumption. Global natural gas consumption grew at 1.7%, with the United States leading in consumption growth at 3%. China, with almost half of the world's total coal consumption, has increased its natural gas usage but it still only makes up about 5% of its energy consumption. Iran, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, has seen stagnation in its energy sector. Iran has the second-largest natural gas reserves, but its energy sector has stagnated due to sanctions and lack of investment. Domestic energy demand has increased by 50% since 2004. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 may impact Iran's natural gas production and global energy market role. In 2015, the US consumed 27,463 bcf of natural gas, making up 23% of global consumption. Natural gas is mainly used for electric power generation, industrial, residential, and commercial purposes in the US. The use of natural gas for electric power generation in the US has significantly increased due to low prices and policies promoting lower emissions. Demand for natural gas has more than doubled since 2000 and is expected to grow by 40% by 2040. The industrial sector in the US has also increased its consumption of natural gas. Global proved natural gas reserves have grown about 19% since 2005, ensuring a 53-year supply at current production levels. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, with shale gas driving the increase. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, with the U.S. accounting for 22% of total production. Between 2005 and 2015, U.S. natural gas production increased by 50%. The United States had the world's largest production increase in natural gas, attributed to unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. U.S. natural gas production is continually rising despite low prices, with shale gas production projected to increase by 73% by 2040. LNG trade increased in 2015, with LNG becoming more prevalent in the global gas trade. In response to the growing LNG trade, countries like Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016. The U.S. natural gas market is evolving due to increased domestic supply from unconventional resources like shale formations. This has led to the expansion of LNG export capacity through modifications and expansions of existing terminals, requiring authorization from regulatory bodies. Technologies like hydraulic fracturing have made shale gas economically competitive, reducing the need for LNG import terminals. The production of shale gas has lowered costs, making it economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast. This has reduced the need for natural gas from other areas, leading to a decrease in imports. The U.S. is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas by 2017, with the first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurring in February 2016. The Panama Canal reopened for commercial business in 2016, offering a potential shipping route for U.S. LNG to Asian markets. However, only 10% of LNG carriers can fit the canal, and no LNG transits have been scheduled. The development in supply has positioned the United States strategically in the global natural gas market, raising questions about the impact on domestic gas prices and the economy. Concerns also exist about the size of U.S. shale gas resources, sustainability of development, and potential limitations. Water use in hydraulic fracturing is a key issue, as U.S. natural gas production continues to grow. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is studying the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and the disposal of wastewater. Concerns include deep-well injection causing human-induced earthquakes and methane emissions from natural gas production. EPA established air standards in 2012 to reduce methane emissions. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane emissions in the natural gas sector. In 2016, the standards were updated to include additional equipment in the gas production chain. Methane emissions from natural gas production are a significant concern for policymakers as the industry continues to expand. Global markets for natural gas are becoming more integrated, with about 30% of natural gas traded internationally. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Natural gas is typically sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, except in the US. U.S. LNG exports have influenced other countries to delink gas exports from oil-indexed prices. Most international natural gas trade is done through long-term contracts, usually lasting 20 years, due to the high cost of transportation. The spot market for natural gas is growing, with Russia being the largest exporter through pipelines to Europe and Qatar leading in LNG exports. Qatar is the top LNG exporter, with most going to Asia and Europe. Europe imports gas from Russia, Norway, and Algeria, seeking more secure sources. Asia relies on LNG, but China is increasingly importing gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. The US and Canada have integrated pipeline systems, with exports to Mexico and Canada expected to increase. US LNG prices are market-based, creating economic incentives. The United States has started exporting LNG, with the first cargo shipped in February 2016 from Louisiana to Brazil. There are multiple LNG export terminal projects under construction in the lower-48 states, including in Louisiana, Maryland, and Texas. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska continues to operate, primarily supplying LNG to Japan. Additionally, the US began shipping LNG to Barbados from Florida in cryogenic containers. Alaska has great potential to become a major source of natural gas, with estimates exceeding 200,000 bcf on the North Slope. However, most gas is reinjected for oil production and not brought to market. Alaskan officials have pushed for a pipeline to sell LNG internationally, but it is considered commercially challenging. In 2016, the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement was signed between the US and several countries. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) are trade agreements that aim to promote economic growth and free trade. The TPP includes countries like Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand, Chile, Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, Canada, and Japan, potentially impacting U.S. natural gas trade. The TTIP is between the U.S. and the EU, addressing market access, regulation, and cooperation rules, also affecting natural gas trade. The Paris Agreement, resulting from the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, establishes measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The U.S. signed the agreement in April 2016. The United States signed the Paris Agreement on April 22, 2016, focusing on emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. U.S. infrastructure challenges include aging gas pipelines from the 1950s and 1960s, requiring significant investment. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is a cartel organization comprising 11 natural gas producing countries, accounting for a significant portion of global gas reserves and trade. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) comprises 11 natural gas producing countries, accounting for a significant portion of global gas reserves and trade. The U.S. has a strong natural gas resource base, making it unlikely for the GECF to significantly affect U.S. consumption in the near future. Europe is vulnerable to cartel control due to imports from GECF members like Russia and Algeria, but market structure limits manipulation. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015, with the U.S. surpassing Russia as the largest producer in 2009. Shale gas development has prompted countries to evaluate their natural gas resources. Most countries are evaluating their potential natural gas resources, but only Canada and the United States are likely to achieve significant commercial production of shale gas before the end of the decade. Many countries lack the necessary data, technology, and equipment for shale gas evaluation and exploitation. The price of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom is market-driven, with the Henry Hub in Erath, LA being a prominent hub for price data. Residential consumers pay the highest price for natural gas, with projections showing an increase in the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to $7.85 per MBtu by 2040 due to growing demand. The demand for natural gas is increasing domestically and internationally, leading to a need for more well completions to meet production levels. Wholesale natural gas is mostly sold under long-term contracts, linking prices to crude oil. Some producers are starting to incorporate spot prices into their pricing formulas due to disparities between contract and spot prices. The regional nature of the industry and price differences between contracts and spot prices are evident. The natural gas industry faces disparities between contract and spot prices, with Asia willing to pay high prices for supplies. Key contract concepts include take-or-pay clauses and destination clauses, which ensure buyers pay regardless of gas receipt and allow cargo redirection. The industry is debating whether natural gas should become the primary energy source globally, with the International Energy Agency projecting a 60% demand increase by 2040. Natural gas is one of the fastest-growing fossil fuels, with a projected 60% increase in demand by 2040. Most of this demand will come from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. The global energy landscape is shifting, with North America leading in unconventional gas production. China is transitioning to a services-focused economy, which may impact its future energy consumption trends. India is expected to contribute significantly to global energy demand, but meeting this demand will require a substantial financial commitment. Natural gas accounts for 6% of India's energy supply and is projected to be less than 10% by 2040. The U.S. electric power industry drives natural gas demand due to low prices and government policies on emissions. Globally, natural gas is expected to make up 28% of electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries leading. Production needs to increase to meet demand, with unconventional resources like coal bed methane and shale gas playing a significant role. Limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas may hinder efforts to maximize natural gas capacity."
