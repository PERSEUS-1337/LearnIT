He endorsed Dmitriy Medvedev as his successor, reassuring Russians that the \"Putin plan\" would continue. Medvedev, who had worked closely with Putin since 2000, was appointed as the next president, with Putin accepting the role of prime minister under his presidency. Dmitriy Medvedev was endorsed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as his successor in 2007. Medvedev, who had never run for elective office, was one of four candidates in the March 2, 2008, presidential election. Opposition candidates faced challenges in registering, with some being denied approval or ending their campaigns early due to alleged government interference. Andrey Bogdanov, a candidate from the pro-Putin Democratic Party, gathered two million signatures to run for president. Medvedev refused to debate other candidates, claiming their programs had no chance of being implemented. Golos found that Medvedev received overwhelming TV coverage in many regions. Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy filed complaints about unequal TV coverage, leading to slightly more coverage for Zyuganov. Putin and Medvedev outlined long-term development programs during the campaign, highlighting stability and prosperity compared to the 1990s. Medvedev's speech emphasized the need for further reforms in health, education, and the judicial system by 2020. He advocated for media independence, protection of private ownership rights, and equal access to healthcare and education for all citizens. Medvedev also called for more opportunities for people to acquire their own homes and land to build a strong middle class. He won 70.28% of almost 75 million votes in the election. In the 2008 presidential election, Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy benefitted from their runner-up results, while Bogdanov conceded defeat quickly. Zyuganov claimed election \"rigging\" denied him extra votes, while Zhirinovskiy pledged support for the new president. OSCE noted concerns about the election process. The OSCE ODIHR declined to monitor the Russian presidential election due to government restrictions. PACE concluded that the election resembled a plebiscite on Putin's rule rather than a competitive election. Concerns were raised about the registration process for independent candidates and media coverage. Amendments in 2005 banned electoral observers from NGOs. Golos sent \"press correspondents\" as observers. Golos sent \"press correspondents\" as observers to voting precincts, witnessing local government officials during vote counting. Putin congratulated Medvedev and announced plans to restructure the government before Medvedev's inauguration on May 7. Putin directed ministries to work on implementing 2020 development goals and national project goals on urban policy, agricultural lands, and social sector reforms. Putin directed ministries to work on implementing 2020 development goals, including plans for finished goods processing of natural resources, strengthening the home mortgage and banking system, and streamlining rules for small businesses. He emphasized the need to find revenues to cover increased social benefits and asserted his substantial constitutional powers as prime minister, including formulating budgets, monetary policy, and foreign economic policies. Observers speculate that Medvedev may serve as a ceremonial president, with Putin retaining key powers and policies from his era. Putin-era \"siloviki\" may face challenges from Medvedev as he asserts himself as president. Analysts suggest a power-sharing arrangement with Putin could lead to possible democratization and a better balance of powers among institutions. Putin plans to hold the prime ministership as long as he meets his objectives, potentially overlooking the possibility of clashes with Medvedev. Some observers predict clashes between Putin and Medvedev due to their different roles. Medvedev faces economic challenges and domestic issues like rising inflation and civil disorder in the North Caucasus. There are concerns about potential government paralysis and the use of military force, as seen in 1993. After the election, Moscow officials sanctioned a large march by the pro-Putin Nashi youth group to protest alleged Western meddling. Medvedev announced a focus on foreign policy and accepted invitations to visit several countries. Recent international problems have eased, including Russia's vote in favor of new sanctions against Iran. Medvedev urged Ukrainian President Yushchenko to pay the country's gas debt. President Bush emphasized the importance of a trustworthy relationship with the new Russian president. Areas of common U.S.-Russian interest include non-proliferation and Iranian nuclear issues. President Bush expressed concerns about Russia's representation at the next G8 Summit and emphasized cooperation on counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, and other issues. Disagreements between the United States and Russia include U.S. missile defenses in Eastern Europe, Kosovo's independence, and NATO enlargement. Putin threatened to target Poland, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine over hosting U.S. missile defenses and NATO membership. Medvedev visited Serbia and supported its opposition to Kosovo's independence. Medvedev's chairmanship of Gazprom focused on economic relations with Europe, likely to continue influencing future chairman. Gazprom seen as a political tool for Putin government, shown by gas supply reduction to Ukraine. Merkel suggests continuity in Russia's relations with the West. Some believe Medvedev may improve energy and other ties with Europe, potentially leading to better U.S.-Russia relations. Analysts argue focus should be on Russia's economic growth rather than increased authoritarianism under Putin. Andrey Illarionov, Putin's former economic advisor, criticizes Russia's \"siloviki dictatorship\" under Medvedev, warning of authoritarian actions like cyber attacks and poisonings."
