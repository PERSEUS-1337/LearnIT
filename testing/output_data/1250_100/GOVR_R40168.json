    "content": "High levels of oil imports and high crude oil and gasoline prices in recent years have increased interest in the U.S. fuel supply. Congressional focus has been on alternatives to petroleum, improving transportation sector efficiency, and enhancing stability and security in the petroleum supply and refining sectors. Global oil prices and refinery constraints led to historic highs in U.S. gasoline pump prices from 2006 to 2008. Interest in alternative fuels and vehicles fluctuates with oil and gasoline price volatility. Statutory policies can help maintain interest during market fluctuations. Gasoline prices eased in 2006 and 2007 before rising significantly in 2008, then falling dramatically after 2008. Prices peaked in spring 2011 before moderating. The rise in interest in alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles peaked in spring 2011 before stabilizing through 2012. Federal policies aim to reduce petroleum consumption by promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels and more efficient vehicles. Key tax incentives for biofuels and electric vehicles expired in 2011 but were extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) for conventional ethanol was not extended, but the mandate to use biofuels in transportation is set to increase yearly through 2022. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) required the use of 15.2 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels in 2012, with a mandate of 16.55 billion gallons for 2013. Cases of fraud in the biodiesel RINs market have led to criminal prosecutions and quality-assurance guidelines from the EPA. Volatility in the spot market for ethanol RINs has raised additional concerns. The EPA finalized a partial waiver petition in January 2011 to allow blends of up to 15% ethanol in gasoline (E15), which was previously limited to 10% (E10). This decision removes a component of the \"blend wall\" that limits the total amount of ethanol blended in gasoline nationwide. Concerns over potential damage to engines and infrastructure have led to challenges in federal court, but some cases have been dismissed due to lack of standing. Bills have been introduced in Congress to limit EPA's authority. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles and established tax credits for electric, alternative fuel, and hybrid vehicles. Little congressional action on energy policy occurred in the late 1990s. In the early 2000s, Congress worked on comprehensive energy legislation due to high fuel prices and growing petroleum demand. The 108th Congress debated energy legislation, including provisions on vehicle tax credits and renewable fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 addressed these topics and was followed by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which expanded the renewable fuel mandate. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) expanded the renewable fuel mandate and tightened federal fuel economy standards. Biofuels are promoted as a strategy for energy security, environmental quality, and farm income. The 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills included titles to promote biofuels and other farm-based energy supplies, with tax credits for cellulosic fuels. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 supported alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The government provides incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for electric vehicles, grants for replacing old diesel engines, and support for battery development. Various tax credits for biofuels production and blending were extended through legislation like the Tax Relief Act of 2010 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The government provides incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits for electric vehicles, grants for replacing old diesel engines, and support for battery development. Legislation like the Tax Relief Act of 2010 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended tax credits for biofuels production and blending, with incentives for algae-based biofuels. Other laws, such as the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments, establish fuel economy standards and promote low emission vehicles. Highway authorization bills also provide tax incentives for ethanol and other fuels, while federal research and development efforts focus on alternative fuels and infrastructure. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended tax incentives for biodiesel and alternative fuels. Concerns over fuel conservation and energy security have led to increased interest in more efficient vehicles. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandates a fuel economy increase to 35 mpg by 2020. Ongoing advancements in hybrid vehicles, ethanol fuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen fuel raise policy questions about tax incentives for these technologies. The text discusses the need for more generous tax incentives for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, the environmental impacts of ethanol and hydrogen production, and the debate over focusing research funds on high-risk technologies like fuel cells or near-term technologies like hybrids. Gasoline price spikes and supply disruptions have led to congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum due to concerns over environmental impact and energy security. Interest in alternatives remains strong with key tax incentives for alternative fuels, including credits for ethanol, biodiesel, and cellulosic biofuels. Most incentives were extended through 2013, except for the conventional ethanol tax credit. Supporters argue for continued incentives to promote the production and purchase of alternative fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established federal mandates for renewable fuels, including biofuels. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules for the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard in 2010, requiring the use of 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuels in transportation fuels. The overall mandate for 2013 is 16.55 billion gallons, with carve-outs for different types of advanced biofuels. The EPA's expanded Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the use of biofuels with reduced greenhouse gas emissions relative to petroleum fuels. Controversy surrounds the EPA's methodology for assessing fuel pathways, with criticism from both biofuels supporters and opponents. The requirement for cellulosic biofuels to be a growing portion of the RFS, starting in 2010, faces challenges as U.S. production capacity falls short of mandated levels. EPA has the authority to waive parts of the RFS to adjust mandates accordingly. EPA used its authority under EISA to adjust the cellulosic biofuel mandate for 2010 to 6.5 million gallons. Due to project delays, the original target of 100 million gallons could not be met. EPA finalized the fuel levels for 2011 with a cellulosic mandate of 6.6 million gallons, below the EISA requirement of 250 million gallons. For 2012, the mandate was further reduced. For 2012, EPA lowered the cellulosic biofuel mandate to 8.65 million gallons, which was later challenged in court. The 2013 proposed mandate is 14 million gallons, with expectations of rapid growth in production capacity. Ethanol concentration in gasoline was limited to E10 due to regulations, warranties, infrastructure design, and local codes. The total volume of ethanol blended into U.S. gasoline is limited to 14-15 billion gallons. The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates will exceed the current ethanol blend wall of 14-15 billion gallons in U.S. gasoline. To meet these requirements, gasoline suppliers may need to blend ethanol above 10% or explore other avenues like using E85 or increasing biodiesel use. Stakeholders are advocating for higher ethanol blends like E15 or E20. Growth Energy applied for a waiver to increase the ethanol concentration to 15% (E15) in 2009, which was approved by the EPA for newer vehicles in 2010 and expanded to include older vehicles in 2011. EPA deferred a decision on older vehicles due to concerns over emissions performance. The EPA denied a waiver for using E15 in older vehicles, heavy trucks, motorcycles, and non-road engines due to concerns over emissions performance. The agency requires proof that increased ethanol content will not harm emission control devices. Factors like vehicle warranties, infrastructure effects, and automaker limitations on ethanol levels also impact the consideration of higher ethanol blends. Vehicle and engine manufacturers have challenged EPA's decision to allow E15 in newer vehicles, citing potential equipment damage concerns. The EPA denied a waiver for using E15 in older vehicles, heavy trucks, motorcycles, and non-road engines due to concerns over emissions performance. The potential risks of higher ethanol concentrations include corrosion of seals and components, fuel tanks, higher operating temperatures, and emissions of pollutants. Fueling infrastructure implications include the need for updated warranties/certifications for systems designed for E10, state laws prohibiting blends higher than E10, and labeling concerns for fuel pumps dispensing E15. EPA proposed new pump labeling rules to indicate E15 availability. Ethanol, mainly produced from corn, is the most widely used biofuel in the United States. Biofuels produced from cellulosic materials like fast-growing trees, prairie grasses, or agricultural wastes are seen as a way to reduce environmental impact and expand the US biofuels industry. While ethanol from corn is widely used, it is resource-intensive and competes with food production. Cellulose requires complex processing to convert into fuel, unlike starches and sugars which are easily fermented. The future of the US biofuels industry is expected to focus on these alternative feedstocks. Processing cellulose into fuels is currently expensive, so research is focused on reducing costs. Questions remain about feasibility and environmental impact of biofuels. R&D is also aimed at increasing yield of biofuel crops and limiting environmental impact. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 promotes cellulosic biofuels development through funding, incentives, and mandates for domestic production. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel mandate to include advanced biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The 2008 Farm Bill established a tax credit for cellulosic biofuels production, and the Renewable Fuel Standard requires obligated parties to submit credits for compliance. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program requires obligated parties to submit Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to cover their obligations. RINs are 38-digit numbers generated for each gallon of renewable fuel, containing data like the year, producer, and type of fuel. Concerns over RIN generation and market integrity led to the establishment of the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) to address errors and fraud in RIN transactions. The EPA has implemented the Renewable Fuel Standard program, requiring obligated parties to submit Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to cover their obligations. RINs are 38-digit numbers generated for each gallon of renewable fuel. Concerns over RIN generation and market integrity led to the establishment of the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS). The EPA has issued Notices of Violations to companies for fraudulently generating biodiesel RINs. To address RIN fraud cases, the EPA is considering a system where RINs can be certified by third parties registered with the EPA. The EPA proposed a Quality Assurance Plan program, offering obligated parties an \"affirmative defense\" if RINs are found to be fraudulent. Invalid RINs would need to be replaced with valid ones by the original generator, third-party certifier, or current RIN holder. The price of undifferentiated renewable fuel RINs, mostly representing corn ethanol, saw a significant increase in early 2013, with spot prices averaging between $0.07 and $0.08 per gallon in January, spiking to roughly $0.90 per gallon in March before dropping to $0.60-$0.70 per gallon by the end of the month. The reasons for this price surge are unclear but may be related to concerns over the blend wall, reduced output from U.S. ethanol producers, and the binding RFS mandates for 2013 or 2014. Market speculation and support from corn growers and ethanol producers for the renewable fuel standard are also factors in the volatility. Concern has risen over ethanol imports due to lower production costs and government incentives in other countries, leading to significantly lower ethanol prices compared to the United States. Previously, imports faced a 2.5% ad valorem tariff and a $0.54 per gallon duty, which expired along with a tax incentive. Reinstating these policies seems unlikely, and before the duty expired, ethanol imports from Caribbean Basin Initiative countries were granted duty-free status under certain conditions. Imports of ethanol from countries like Brazil or Europe, dehydrated in CBI countries, have been criticized for avoiding tariffs. With the renewable fuel standard and high prices in the US, there may be more interest in importing ethanol. The RFS may lead to increased imports of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard in California could also boost demand for low-carbon biofuels. President Bush extended the duty on imported ethanol until December 31, 2008. The duty on imported ethanol was extended through various legislative acts until December 31, 2011, but has since expired. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated alternative fuel vehicle purchase requirements, criticized for not requiring the use of alternative fuels. Gasoline is more affordable and accessible than alternative fuels due to limited infrastructure. In 2002, a lawsuit was filed against federal agencies for failing to meet EPAct quotas, leading to compliance reports. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified EPAct requirements for dual-fuel vehicles to operate on alternative fuels, with waivers granted by the Secretary of Energy. Compliance improved, with all federal fleets meeting requirements in FY2007. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended EPAct requirements for dual-fuel vehicles to use alternative fuels, with waivers available. President Bush signed a law in 2008 expanding the definition of \"alternative fuel vehicle\" to include hybrid, advanced diesel, and fuel cell vehicles. The DOE has the authority to extend requirements to local and private fleets, but as of 2002, no decision had been made. The U.S. District Court ordered the DOE to establish a timeline for new rulemaking regarding alternative fuel vehicles. President Bush and President Obama signed executive orders promoting the use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and setting fuel savings and greenhouse gas reduction goals. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $300 million for high fuel economy vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded tax incentives for purchasing electric, hybrid, alternative fuel, and advanced diesel vehicles. The incentives included credits up to $3,400 for hybrids and advanced diesels, and up to $4,000 for alternative fuel vehicles. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 introduced a tax credit for plug-in vehicles, including pure electric and plug-in hybrids. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified tax credits for plug-in vehicles, including hybrids and alternative fuel vehicles. The law established credits for different vehicle types, such as two-wheeled and low-speed vehicles, and allowed purchasers to claim credits even if subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Eligibility for the tax credit phases out after a manufacturer produces 200,000 eligible vehicles. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are synthetic fuels produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease. They can be blended with conventional diesel and used in engines with minimal modifications. Interest in biodiesel is growing due to its ability to displace conventional diesel and its potential to promote rural economies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, production costs are currently high, leading to interest in tax incentives for production. Tax incentives in the form of production tax credits or excise tax exemptions are being considered to reduce production costs for biodiesel. The American Jobs Creation Act provided a tax credit of up to $1.00 per gallon for biodiesel sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended these credits through 2008 and established a credit for small agri-biodiesel producers and renewable diesel. Tax incentives, such as production tax credits, have been extended multiple times to support hydrogen fuel and fuel cells. Interest in hydrogen fuel has increased due to its potential to reduce dependence on energy imports and vehicle emissions. However, production costs for hydrogen fuel and fuel cells remain high, and fuel-cycle emissions can be a concern. The Bush Administration strongly supported research and development for hydrogen and fuel cells, announcing the FreedomCAR initiative in 2002 and the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative in 2003. A total of $1.4 billion was appropriated by Congress for these initiatives, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizing $3.3 billion through FY2010 for fuel cell and hydrogen R&D. Opponents raised concerns about the commercial viability of hydrogen fuel and fuel cells. Some argue that hydrogen fuel and fuel cells may not be commercialized, drawing funding away from near-term technologies like hybrid vehicles. Research and development alone may not reduce petroleum dependence, suggesting tightening fuel economy standards for all vehicles. Hybrids, combining gasoline/diesel engines with electric motors, are gaining popularity in the US, improving efficiency and potentially limiting oil consumption without major infrastructure changes. Some states offer benefits to hybrid vehicle drivers, such as HOV lane exemptions. The 2005 surface transportation reauthorization act allows states to exempt high-efficiency vehicles from HOV lane restrictions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 expanded incentives for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program provides up to $25 billion in direct loans for the production of highly fuel-efficient vehicles. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program provides up to $25 billion in direct loans for the production of highly fuel-efficient vehicles. The Government Accountability Office has questioned DOE's technical expertise in assessing loan applications and project performance. Various existing policies promote similar technologies, such as stricter vehicle fuel economy standards. NGVs, autogas, ethanol industry outlook, alternative fuels data center, hydrogen and fuel cells program, vehicle technologies office, energy policy act of 1992, advanced technology vehicle loan program implementation. The report on enhanced technical oversight and performance measures for alternative fuels is underway in Washington, DC in February 2011."
