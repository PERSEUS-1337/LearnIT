    "content": "The \"Identity Theft Protection Act of 2006\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for the protection of data through security freeze measures. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include a new section on protection of data through security freeze. Consumers can request a security freeze on their consumer report to block information release without authorization. The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows consumers to request a security freeze on their consumer report, preventing unauthorized access to their information. Consumer reporting agencies can inform third parties about the security freeze and if a third party requests access to a frozen report, they can treat the application as incomplete. The security freeze remains until the consumer requests its removal in writing or by telephone, and can only be removed by the agency upon the consumer's request. Consumer reporting agencies can temporarily suspend a security freeze on a consumer's report upon request, specifying the duration. They must notify the consumer in writing before removing a freeze due to misrepresentation. Additionally, agencies must place a security freeze on a consumer's report promptly upon request. Consumer reporting agencies must promptly place, remove, or temporarily suspend a security freeze on a consumer's report upon request. They are required to notify the consumer and other covered entities within specific timeframes after receiving a request for freeze removal or suspension. Consumer reporting agencies must promptly place, remove, or temporarily suspend a security freeze on a consumer's report within 3 business days of receiving the request. They must also send written confirmation of the action to the consumer within 10 business days. A consumer reporting agency cannot take these actions without proper identification. Consumer reporting agencies must promptly place, remove, or temporarily suspend a security freeze on a consumer's report at the consumer's request with proper identification. Exceptions include use by entities related to the consumer's financial obligations and by government agencies or law enforcement. Entities allowed to access consumer credit information include government agencies, law enforcement, child support agencies, Department of Health and Human Services, IRS, State taxing authorities, and entities administering credit file monitoring subscriptions. Consumer reporting agencies can charge a reasonable fee for placing or suspending a security freeze on a consumer's credit report, based on prevailing state law fees. No fee is allowed for removing a security freeze, except for identity theft victims. Consumer reporting agencies cannot charge a fee for placing, removing, or temporarily suspending a security freeze on a consumer report if the consumer is a victim of identity theft and has filed a police report, or if there has been a data security breach involving the consumer's information. Additionally, if a security freeze is in place, the agency cannot change certain information without notifying the consumer in writing within 30 days. Consumer reporting agencies must notify the consumer in writing within 30 days of any changes to key personal information such as name, date of birth, social security number, or address. Written confirmation is not required for technical modifications, but for address changes, confirmation must be sent to both the new and former addresses. Certain exemptions apply to agencies that act as resellers of credit information. Consumer reporting agencies are not required to maintain a permanent database of consumer information for new reports. Certain entities, such as check services or fraud prevention companies, are exempt from placing security freezes on consumer reports. Deposit account information services provide reports on negative account activities to financial institutions for review. The amendment for reviewing consumer requests for deposit accounts will take effect after a 6-month period from the enactment of the Act."
