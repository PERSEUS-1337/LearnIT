The dairy industry faces issues of consolidation and industry concentration. Public workshops were announced by the Administration in 2009 to address competition problems in agriculture. A workshop on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry structure, financial stress for dairy farmers, historical development, farm and retail prices for dairy products, and industry consolidation and concentration at different market levels. In 2009, the U.S. dairy industry faced financial stress due to lower milk prices, leading to government support programs totaling over $1 billion. Despite this assistance, the number of dairy farms and cows decreased. However, milk prices increased in 2010, reaching $15.10 per hundredweight. The average farm milk prices increased to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010 from $11.80 per hundredweight the previous year. Despite the price increase, dairy farmers are still facing financial concerns due to lost equity and high feed prices. The industry and Congress are exploring options to address fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers. The Obama Administration and Congress are also looking into consolidation and concentration issues in the dairy industry. The early history of the dairy industry involved government intervention and the development of cooperative associations among producers to negotiate with milk handlers. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives, leading to the implementation of \"classified pricing\" for milk based on its use. During the Great Depression, demand for milk dropped, leading to the breakdown of the classified pricing system. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market and ensure adequate milk supplies at reasonable prices. Import quotas were enacted to protect producers from foreign competition. The government began supporting milk prices in the late 1940s through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. Additional programs such as the Dairy Export Incentives Program and Milk Income Loss Contract were added to national dairy policy in later years. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century, with improved transportation and national distribution leading to a shift from local to national markets. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century, with improved transportation and national distribution leading to a shift from local to national markets. Trucks transport bulk milk thousands of miles to meet market demands, while dairy manufacturing plants ship products like cheese and yogurt across the country. The relationship between farm and retail prices has been a long-standing issue, with a declining farm share of the retail food dollar due to factors like agricultural productivity gains. This has raised concerns about economic stress in the agricultural sector, particularly for dairy farmers. The farm share of the retail food dollar for dairy products was approximately one-third in 2006, higher than the all-food average. The trend for milk and dairy products remained generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with slight variations in farm-share for different dairy products. The farm-value share of retail cheddar cheese prices showed a slight uptrend in 2008 and early 2009. The marketing margin between farm and retail prices widened, reaching a record high in January 2009. However, by December 2009, the difference between farm and retail prices decreased sharply due to lower input costs. In early 2010, prices returned to the five-year average level. Retail prices for food products often take months to adjust to changes in farm prices, with increases being passed on to consumers more quickly than decreases. This phenomenon, known as \"sticky\" retail food prices, is influenced by consumer behavior, inventory management, and competition among supermarkets. Despite rapid price increases, retail prices may not fully decrease when farm prices go down, which does not necessarily indicate market power abuse by retailers. Additionally, supermarkets may attract less price-sensitive consumers through competition effects. Consolidation in the agriculture industry, including the dairy sector, has led to fewer but larger operations, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. This trend has also been observed at the farm, cooperative, and processor levels. Despite a decline in the number of dairy farms, productivity has increased, requiring fewer farms to produce the same amount of milk. However, growth is limited by economies of scale, leading to slower consolidation in recent years. Concentration in the dairy industry has increased over time, with a sharp reduction in the number of dairy farms due to increased cow output and advances in technology. Despite a decline in the number of farms, total milk production has steadily increased. Domestic demand for milk has grown slowly, while consumption of dairy products like cheese has risen, offsetting a decline in fluid milk consumption. Exports of dairy products have increased in recent years, reaching record levels in 2008. Farm numbers have shifted, with smaller farms declining and larger farms with 1,000 cows or more increasing by 20% due to lower production costs. In 2009, farms with 1,000 cows or more produced 47% of U.S. milk output, compared to small farms with fewer than 100 cows producing only 16%. The share of milk produced by large dairy farms increased from 35% in 2005 to 47% in 2009, benefiting from scale economies and modern technology. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger farms (e.g., California with 850 cows per farm) compared to Wisconsin with smaller farms averaging 88 cows. Operating costs are influenced by feed costs, with western states facing higher costs due to purchasing feed, while states like Wisconsin with on-farm feed production have lower operating costs. Dairy cooperatives, owned and operated by farmers, manage milk distribution and product manufacturing. The number of cooperatives has decreased since the 1940s, with 155 remaining in 2007. They now account for 83% of farm milk marketings, up from under half in the 1940s. In 2008, 79% of the milk produced in the United States was marketed by the 50 largest dairy cooperatives, with the top four cooperatives accounting for 40% of U.S. milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act in allowing farmers to take cooperative action and remain independent producers. Cooperatives have historically improved farmers' bargaining position with milk. The dairy processing industry includes cooperatives that represent farmers in rulemaking processes and bargaining with milk handlers. Changes in demand, technology, and retail have impacted dairy processors and manufacturers, leading to a decline in the number of firms but stabilization of around 1,100 manufacturing plants in the United States. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry are similar to other food processing sectors, with the four-firm concentration ratio at 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in 2002. While dairy processing concentration is not unusually high nationally, local or regional markets can be more concentrated. The level of industry concentration in the fluid milk industry has recently increased following a merger in 2001 between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods. The retail sector for food products has changed substantially in recent years, with price competition from nontraditional food retailers causing traditional supermarket chains to review pricing and product strategies. Changes in retail sector strategies and competitive pressures have resulted in consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry. The top four firms accounted for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 36% by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers by large grocery retailers. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm concentration shares averaging 74% in specific market areas in 2003. This trend has been consistent over the years, with similar levels reported in 1992 and 1998. Retail consolidation and concentration have led to dairy processors and manufacturers increasing in size and market share to meet demands for lower costs from food retailers. The primary concern with concentration is the limited choices available to consumers at the individual level. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors may not adversely affect agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Efficiency gains from concentration could lead to cost savings for consumers and increased demand for commodities, benefiting farmers. Experts predict that concentration is likely to increase in the future, potentially raising concerns about market power. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing and regional retail milk markets, finding that concentration may not impact commodity or food prices significantly. Efficiency gains were noted, with experts suggesting that further concentration could be beneficial. Market power effects were considered, with dairy cooperatives potentially offsetting the power of dairy processors. Evidence of market power was found in regional retail milk markets, with examples of noncompetitive behavior in some metropolitan areas. Some experts believe that concentration in the dairy industry could lead to fewer retail outlets and increased market power among retailers. Large retail firms may pressure food processors to consolidate, leading to further concentration at the food processor level. Concerns also exist about how concentration affects price transparency in dairy product markets, potentially weakening market \"discovery\" of prices. Fewer transactions due to concentration could impact market efficiency. The primary spot market for dairy products is at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where prices are determined by buyers and sellers. Some believe the CME is inadequate due to thin trading, lack of transparency, and volatility. Dairy producer groups argue that this market adversely affects producers. In a 2007 study, it was found that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants are prepared to counteract any manipulation by monitoring the market closely. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for signs of manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants paid a penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through cheese purchases on the CME. Some industry participants want to increase sales volume on the CME to reduce manipulation possibilities. In 2004, the CME saw an increase in cheese trading volume. The CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a global dairy risk management tool. There is interest in expanding USDA's price reporting system for dairy products to improve price transparency. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition and illegal mergers, enforced by the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act are U.S. antitrust laws that focus on market competition and illegal mergers. The Sherman Act prohibits concerted activity that restrains trade and monopolization, while the Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition. Violations can result in fines or imprisonment. The \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect actual practices in analyzing mergers and acquisitions. The Clayton Act allows for premerger notification to examine potential mergers/acquisitions before consummation. Premerger remedies include legal action to stop mergers or conditioning federal approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption for farmer cooperatives. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption for farmer cooperatives, allowing them to jointly process and market agricultural products. In a specific case, Dean Foods purchased two plants from Foremost Farms, leading to a civil antitrust suit alleging a violation of the Clayton Act. The Department of Justice claims that the acquisition will reduce competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains and restaurants. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Dean Foods for acquiring two plants from Foremost Farms, which they claim will reduce competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains and restaurants in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit seeks to require Dean Foods to sell the dairy processing plants it acquired from Foremost Farms. Dean Foods now holds approximately 57% of the market for processed milk in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Dean Foods believes the acquisition complies with antitrust laws and benefits dairy farmers by providing a stable outlet for their milk, resulting in cost savings for consumers and increased competition in the region. The ongoing antitrust case against Dean Foods in the U.S. dairy industry involves allegations of conspiracy to control the supply of fluid milk in the Northeast, leading to lower prices for farmers. The lawsuit names Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood as defendants. The case highlights the challenges smaller firms face in competing in markets with excess capacity. The antitrust case in the U.S. dairy industry involves allegations of market power abuse by DFA and DMS, leading to lower prices for farmers in the Northeast. The lawsuit claims that dairy producers must affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood. DFA argues that it has helped increase returns for farmers through cost-saving efficiencies. Observers predict a lengthy legal process for resolution. Determining the net effect of concentration in the dairy industry is complex due to various factors influencing market power and efficiency gains. Market power can be influenced by product differentiation, market entry ease, and contract structures. Efficiency gains can come from technology changes and business practices. Economic events and government policies also impact commodity prices, making it challenging to isolate the effects of concentration."
