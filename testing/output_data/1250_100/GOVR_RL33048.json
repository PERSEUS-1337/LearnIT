    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since 9/11. Congress focuses on security of chemicals in rail, tanker trucks, and commercial facilities. Legislation like H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 address penalties for criminal activities around ports and marine vessels. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on risks, federal statistics, maritime security regulation, and policy issues. It discusses the security of marine shipments of hazardous chemicals as part of the nation's overall chemical security strategy. The report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose catastrophic hazards to the public. It does not cover other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. Due to legal limitations, detailed statistics on specific hazardous chemicals or ports are not provided. Hazardous chemical marine vessels are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility, posing a serious threat if released near populated areas. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is crucial for homeland security. While no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in a terrorist attack on civilians, accidents involving such shipments have shown their potential to impact nearby communities. Intelligence suggests that terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute hazardous chemical shipping attacks in the United States. Major accidents involving marine transportation of hazardous chemicals are rare but can be catastrophic. Major accidents involving hazardous chemical shipments have shown their potential to impact nearby communities. Incidents like the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax and the 1947 Texas City disaster have resulted in significant casualties. While no terrorist attacks involving hazardous chemical shipments have occurred, incidents like the 1985 fire aboard the Ariadne in Somalia and the 1999 fire aboard the Multitank Ascania in Scotland have raised concerns for public safety. In the late 1990s, there were attempts to release chemicals from land-based facilities in foreign war zones and in the United States. Terrorists targeted marine vessels to destroy them or their cargo, with incidents like the foiled Al-Qaeda plot in June 2002 and the attack on U.S. and British warships in the Straits of Gibraltar. In October 2002, the oil tanker Limburg was attacked off the Yemeni coast by a bomb-laden fishing boat. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups targeting hazardous chemical vessels and crashing them into ports. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is focused on the security of chemical infrastructure, including tanker ships carrying flammable and toxic chemicals. LNG tankers have been identified as potential terrorist targets in security alerts. The Department of Homeland Security has raised concerns about the risks associated with LNG shipments, stating that they can never be entirely eliminated. A report by Sandia National Laboratories in 2004 considered potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers as credible and possible, identifying various vulnerabilities such as ramming, explosives, hijacking, and external terrorist actions. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 focuses on terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels could pose a catastrophic hazard to the general public if accidentally released or combusted. Numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. They classify materials like toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable ones. The DOT ranks materials by hazard type but not by degree of hazard. They also provide a ranking of relative hazard by general class or division. The DOT requires shippers of highly hazardous cargo to develop security plans for materials such as radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous material, and more. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters, including regulations for certain dangerous cargoes and hazardous marine cargoes at waterfront facilities. Various hazardous materials are listed in Coast Guard regulations for different types of vessels and handling facilities. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. Facilities with specified threshold quantities must file risk management plans summarizing potential threats from large releases. The Clean Air Act Amendments include 14 listed substances and at least 100 additional chemicals designated by the EPA based on health and environmental risks. EPA also designated 77 acutely toxic chemicals. The EPA regulates facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for large releases. The EPA promulgated a list of acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. The list was amended to exclude certain substances in 1998 and 2000. The current EPA/RMP list identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the general public. The report uses EPA/RMP chemicals as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most hazardous substances also found in DOT and Coast Guard lists. Radioactive materials and explosives are notable classes not on the EPA/RMP list, but they make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable, with variations in toxicity and flammability among specific chemicals. Ammonia is a toxic gas used in fertilizer production and other applications, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, a heating fuel, can be asphyxiating and flammable. Methyloxirane is used in manufacturing foam and solvents. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing foam and solvents. Human exposure can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It is extremely flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous and subject to special regulatory treatment. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for facilities on land, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing their hazard in a marine incident. Other chemicals evaporate quickly or create larger hazard zones in a marine release. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce that can be used to estimate shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. The ACE database can estimate marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. It is important to consider both size and number of shipments for analyzing marine cargo terrorism hazards. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included due to their chemical properties that make them hazardous to human health. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways. The volume of hazardous materials in a shipment is crucial for assessing potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. The number of shipments can increase the overall terrorist risk due to more opportunities for attacks. EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for these chemicals. The EPA sets risk planning thresholds between 500 and 20,000 pounds for hazardous chemicals. Shipments of these chemicals often exceed the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Hazardous cargoes are shipped hundreds to thousands of times, with no clear distinction between low and high frequency shipments. Cargo vessel characteristics play a crucial role in determining their vulnerability to security threats. In 2003, over 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia. These tankers have large onboard tanks that may be pressurized or refrigerated. Liquefied gas tankers have large onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to accommodate different cargo needs. International shipping codes impose strict standards for their construction and operation. These tankers are double-hulled, with cargo tanks built to withstand high pressures or low temperatures. They are highly resistant to grounding and collision damage, carrying only LNG or a combination of different liquefied gases in separate storage tanks, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity ships. Chemical parcel tankers can carry 3,000 to 50,000 tons of liquid and chemical cargoes in 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, adhere to international construction standards with cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings. They have double bottoms to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes and can carry multiple hazardous chemicals simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed for bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways, with sizes ranging from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Liquid chemical barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of cargo capacity and may be self-propelled or unpowered, relying on tugboats for movement. They travel in groups on river systems, with some barges being refrigerated and capable of carrying hazardous chemicals like ammonia and propylene. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for liquid cargoes. Hazardous chemicals are transported on various types of vessels, including container ships and roll-on/roll-off vessels. Large quantities of these chemicals can be present on a container ship at any time. The public hazards associated with these chemicals on marine vessels are proportional to the volume of chemicals present. Comparing the volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels to other modes of transportation and stationary storage facilities on land can provide valuable information. Bulk transportation modes for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals include marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks. Shipments may use all three modes sequentially. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, containerized tank cars on railcars up to 70 tons. Highway tanker trucks carry 15 to 30 tons. Table 2 summarizes cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers transporting EPA/RMP chemicals. Multiple tanks are common on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Bulk transportation modes for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals include marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks. Marine cargo tank capacity generally exceeds that of a single rail or highway tanker truck by one or more orders of magnitude. Comparing actual volumes shipped across these modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple shipments. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous materials are often larger than land shipments. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. Facilities required to file risk management plans have the highest on-site quantities of EPA/RMP chemicals. Comparison of marine and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals shows that average marine shipments are generally larger than average volumes stored at chemical plants. The largest marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, where port facilities may serve as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer of hazardous cargo. Some port facilities receive hazardous marine cargo directly for use in industrial processes. Total marine shipments and specific chemicals vary across ports, impacting security hazards related to volume and type of cargo. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 out of 360 commercial ports in the United States. The top 30 ports handled 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage, with Baton Rouge shipping 22 EPA/RMP chemicals exceeding 2,500 tons. Security concerns exist for all ports handling hazardous marine shipments. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States, mainly located in the Gulf of Mexico, handle a significant amount of hazardous cargo. LPG and ammonia are the most frequently shipped hazardous chemicals through these ports. Security concerns exist for all ports handling hazardous marine shipments. The list of hazardous material ports in the United States is derived from EPA estimates and is just one factor in assessing terrorism risk. Other key factors include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, and port infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program, which provides security grants to eligible ports. The Coast Guard is the lead agency for promoting maritime security. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for promoting U.S. maritime security, including vessel and port security. They track, board, and inspect commercial ships approaching U.S. waters. Special concern is given to ships carrying hazardous cargo, with regulations in place for their construction, operation, and cargo transfer. Compliance with safety regulations could help mitigate damage from a terrorist attack. Prior to 9/11, the Coast Guard had limited regulations specifically for terrorism. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded maritime security regulations to prevent sabotage or subversive acts. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, focusing on vessels, facilities, and other vital infrastructure. These assessments inform security measures for key marine assets and the development of new maritime security standards. The Coast Guard has played a leading role in developing maritime security standards under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. The ISPS Code requires ships and port facilities worldwide to have security plans approved by their national government, implement security measures at different threat levels, designate security officers, deploy security equipment, monitor access, and ensure security communications. The Coast Guard has reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels under the MTSA and ISPS Code. They have conducted on-site inspections to ensure plan implementation and assessed the security of strategic ports. Specific measures have been taken to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels, including evaluating vulnerabilities and blast consequences. Reporting of information is required for U.S. bound vessels and inland barges carrying hazardous chemicals. The Coast Guard requires vessels carrying hazardous chemicals to report information prior to arrival or departure. They assess security risks, may board vessels, and enforce security measures during harbor transit. Coast Guard patrol boats may escort ships with hazardous cargo, and roving patrols may be required while moored. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat levels, and Maritime Safety and Security Teams can perform security operations as needed. The Coast Guard is enhancing maritime domain awareness by requiring vessels at U.S. ports to have AIS transponders. They are installing AIS receivers at all ports and developing joint harbor operations centers to monitor vessel traffic and coordinate responses to threats. The Coast Guard is working with law enforcement to coordinate responses to threats. They are enlisting the public through the \"Waterways Watch\" program to report suspicious activity. Additionally, the Coast Guard is collaborating with the Transportation Security Administration to enhance security for merchant mariners and landside workers. NOAA maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program for chemical dispersion. NOAA's CAMEO program provides response recommendations for chemicals and air dispersion models for emergency planners. They have partnered with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals. NOAA and DHS coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups, like the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee, also work to promote security for hazardous marine cargo. The Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) is an advisory group composed of members from various sectors involved in marine transportation of hazardous materials. In 2002, CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators (AWO) collaborated with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to create a vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, especially for maritime vessels and ports. Despite new security measures since 9/11, policy issues like risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness still need Congressional attention. Terrorism risk related to hazardous marine cargo involves threat, vulnerability, and consequence uncertainties, with debates on potential threats by terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters. The debate over the threat of terrorist attacks on hazardous chemical shipping in U.S. waters post-9/11 continues. Some experts believe public concern is overstated and should not hinder maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to target such shipping. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and the shifting goals of attackers make it challenging to assess the probability of an attack. The Coast Guard and NOAA have implemented security measures and risk assessments for vessels and ports, but uncertainties remain in vulnerability and consequence analysis. Some analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels are not well understood. Public controversy surrounds terrorist risks to LNG shipping due to conflicting studies from government and private sector groups. Limited public information is available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks, despite evidence from past incidents. Research on intentional release of hazardous chemicals in marine environments is lacking, posing challenges for security assessments and plans. The value and effectiveness of security strategies for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence, especially for attacks affecting the general public. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty can help prioritize maritime security activities. Security experts can enhance risk analysis by studying vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. A federal role may be crucial for ensuring methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, locations, and agencies in security analysis. The costs and concerns associated with hazardous marine cargo security have been a focus for policy makers. Coast Guard resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could otherwise be used for boating safety, search and rescue, drug interdiction, or other missions. A recent Government Accountability Office study reported a significant increase in security activities for the Coast Guard following 9/11. President Bush requested increased funding for port, waterway, and coastal security in FY2006. The Coast Guard's FY2006 budget seeks additional funding for general maritime security, including new response boats and crew. State and local agencies are also seeking more funding to offset the costs of hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers which may cost up to $80,000 to secure each time they deliver a shipment. This could potentially divert limited local resources from other important public services. Federal officials recommend new LNG terminal operators to pay for additional maritime security needed for their facilities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires cost-sharing for LNG tanker security. Some government officials are concerned about ambiguous security cost accounting tied to uncertain federal funding sources. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, arguing that their taxes should cover it. Others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security beyond what their tax payments cover. Security costs for LNG shipments may not reflect costs for securing other hazardous marine cargo. New security technology and threat intelligence may help lower future security costs. The Coast Guard has security measures in place to protect hazardous chemicals shipping, but the effectiveness of these measures is questioned. There is a lack of performance measures to evaluate progress in making the nation more secure, especially in seaport security actions. Some question whether the Coast Guard efficiently deploys security resources and whether adequate measures are in place to evaluate their security activities. Some question if Coast Guard security adequately addresses terrorism risks in ports, especially regarding hazardous cargo. There are concerns about the level of security for chemical vessels and disparities in protection between ports. Excessive security in some ports could be a result of varying levels of protection for similar chemical shipments. In overseeing Coast Guard security activities, Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of hazardous marine cargo security. Concerns include emergency response to chemical attacks, with potential for high casualties overwhelming emergency agencies and medical facilities. Specialized treatment for poisoning and burns, as well as salvage operations for damaged vessels, pose additional challenges in such scenarios. The hazardous marine cargo security concerns include the need for emergency response plans for chemical attacks, with potential funding sources such as the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to quantities stored at large chemical plants. Marine vessels carrying hazardous chemicals near populated areas in the U.S. could be attractive terrorist targets, potentially causing catastrophic injuries. The Coast Guard has authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping and is evolving its security activities to improve maritime security. Congressional policymakers may question terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate efforts by federal agencies and the private sector in securing hazardous chemical cargo. Makers may analyze if the Coast Guard, government agencies, and private sector have enough resources to secure hazardous chemical cargo against terrorist attacks. Evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards is important. Congress may assess how U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security fits into the overall strategy to protect the public. Balancing resources for chemicals security across marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities is a policy challenge due to different homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information pose challenges for securing hazardous chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics for planning and managing projects. Hazardous chemical security poses challenges due to limited information on vulnerability and consequences, making it difficult to compare terrorism risks across sectors. Balancing resources for chemical security across different transportation modes is a policy challenge. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics for planning and managing projects, including separate domestic and foreign commerce databases. Vessel types recorded include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. Vessel operators must report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE waterborne commerce databases may be used for chemical-specific analysis with limitations and caveats. EPA/RMP cargo statistics are estimated based on available data. The EPA/RMP cargo statistics are estimated based on available data, with key caveats regarding cargo classification using standardized commodity codes. Inconsistencies in classification are addressed through comparison of codes and consultation with experts. For example, LNG and LPG were initially classified under the same code but were separated using trade data. The Department of Energy separated LNG and LPG volumes for the report. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a shipment. The ACE data may contain errors due to the complexity of queries. The ACE identified inconsistencies in their waterborne commerce databases, which were corrected. However, there may still be data quality errors unnoticed by both the ACE and CRS. The report provides summary estimates of chemicals shipping data without specific vessel or company details. ACE data on individual shipments, vessels, or operators is considered privileged information not for public release."
