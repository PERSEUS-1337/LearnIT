The covered agency must provide a description of data security management practices, including software inventories, licensing agreements for security controls, and monitoring for threats on Federal computer systems. The covered agency must describe how they are using specified software, provide reasons for not using it if applicable, and outline policies for ensuring data security practices are implemented by entities providing services. The report may be based on existing audits or evaluations and can include a classified annex if necessary.
