    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until the final FY2011 DOD budget. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine in 2011, terminating the F-35 engine competition. The F-35, powered by the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, won the Joint Strike Fighter competition. Congress required development of an alternate engine, the F136, which was ultimately terminated in 2011 despite multiple attempts to keep the program funded. Supporters of the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program argue that developing a second engine for the F-35 would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured. Procuring a second engine would also increase F-35 life-cycle operation and support costs and pose challenges for aircraft carriers. Additionally, having a second engine is deemed unnecessary to sustain international interest in the F-35. The F-35 has capabilities, procurement cost, and operating and support cost that make it attractive to potential buyers. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants and airframes. Development of the F135 engine has progressed to the point where an alternate engine program is no longer necessary. Critics argue that terminating the alternate engine program does not comply with the FY2008 defense authorization act. The FY2008 defense authorization act requires the development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to ensure competitiveness and reduce costs. Having a second engine would prevent grounding the entire fleet in case of issues with the primary engine. Having a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter would reduce costs, promote better engine performance, and increase reliability. It would also allow for quicker production surges and maintain international interest in the program. The presence of competition in engine production would benefit potential foreign buyers and help hold down costs. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD in 2011, with General Electric and Rolls-Royce ending their self-funded development of the F136 engine. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program. The estimated cost of the F135 SDD contract increased from $4.8 billion at contract award in 2001 to $6.7 billion as of September 2009, with $0.8 billion in cost growth and $1.1 billion reflecting an increase in scope. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion from FY1995-FY2009, including $1.7 billion for SDD work for the F136 engine from FY2005-FY2009. The F136 team's effort did not include certain components developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines. Some members of Congress questioned the status of the alternate engine program during a period of a CR, which prohibits new starts or procurement rates above FY2010 levels. The CR set DOD spending at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would continue funding activities on a pro-rata basis. The alternate engine program was funded at FY2010 levels until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that Congress added $1.8 billion for the program, with an additional $2.9 billion projected over the next five years. He emphasized that there is little advantage to taxpayers in having a second engine, as most customers will only buy one. The F135 engine program is progressing well, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700, while the F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing. Gates expressed concerns that the second engine may face similar development problems as the first one. At a hearing in February 2010, Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to unclear cost-benefit analysis. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz argued against an alternate engine, citing advancements in engine technology and the potential impact on the number of F-35s produced. General Schwartz and Adm. Roughead expressed skepticism about the need for an alternate engine for the F-35, questioning the cost-benefit analysis and space constraints on carriers. Marine Corps Gen. Cartwright highlighted the potential for investing in more Predators instead. The idea of having a second engine manufacturer was seen as a way to introduce competition during the aircraft production process. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the F-35 was no longer needed as a hedge against the main engine program's failure. The cost of developing a second engine was deemed high, with minimal financial benefits from competition. The Office of Management and Budget estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars from canceling the program. The GAO testified at a hearing that competitive pressures could save enough to offset costs in the JSF program. They estimated an additional $3.5 to $4.5 billion investment for the alternate engine program, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. The \"Great Engine War\" in the 1980s resulted in significant savings across the life cycle of the engine. Nonfinancial benefits of competition include better performance and increased reliability. Cost has been a significant issue in the alternate engine debate, with proponents arguing for a competitor to control costs. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135 engine. Secretary Gates mentioned cost growth is expected for developmental aircraft and allocated funds to address program risks. The Administration believes the benefits of a second engine do not justify the costs. Additionally, a Joint Assessment Team was created to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues. The Joint Assessment Team (JAT) was tasked with understanding the production cost and affordability of the F135 engine. A Pentagon study showed that adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan. Despite reduced development costs for the second engine, the potential cost savings remain uncertain. Christine Fox, from the Defense Department, stated that the cost savings from two F-35 engine programs do not justify the expenses. Pratt & Whitney allocated $1 billion for additional engines and improvements, with $400 million for engine enhancements, mainly for the F-35B. A third of the upgrades are to meet original specifications, while two-thirds aim to exceed them. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act mandated three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program. The Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG), Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), and GAO conducted studies in 2007 using data from the JSF program office and contractors. They had differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program, citing non-financial benefits like fleet readiness and international relations. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, noting favorable assumptions for dual sourcing. The CAIG study estimated that an F-35 engine competition would need to achieve a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs in constant FY2002 dollars over the lifetime of the program to break even. On a net-present-value (NPV) basis, the study found the procurement-cost reduction required for break-even would be 25.6%. The study concluded that DOD would be unable to recoup its initial investment in the alternate engine development program through procurement savings alone. The CAIG study discussed the potential savings needed for an F-35 engine competition to break even by 2040, estimating a 25.6% reduction in engine procurement costs. It highlighted the issue of growth potential in the F-35 engine due to aircraft weight increases, stating that modifications would be necessary for Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine to allow for thrust growth. The IDA study examined engine competition for other fighter programs and suggested that an F-35 engine competition could result in significant benefits. The IDA study estimated that an F-35 engine competition would result in a gross savings of 11% to 18%. It concluded that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur investment costs of $8.8 billion and would not be feasible to recoup through procurement-cost savings alone. The study stated that DOD had limited historical data on potential O&S savings and highlighted contractor responsiveness as a key factor in the Great Engine War. The GAO study suggested that having an alternate engine for the F-35 could prevent the entire fleet from being grounded due to engine issues. It stated that cost savings of 10.3% to 12.3% would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20%. The program was recommended to continue for non-financial benefits, with expectations to reach break-even by the late 2020s. The size of the F-35 production run can impact the potential for an alternate engine program to break even. U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement numbers and engine choices will influence the production run size. GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney made offers to build engines at fixed prices after initial lots. The F135 price proposal for the F-35 was initially declined by DOD, leading to a cost-plus contract. Pratt & Whitney later agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs reported to be 16% lower than the previous lot. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006 outlined production work for the JSF Air System, including propulsion systems like the F135. The status of this MOU has not been updated according to the Air Force. The Air Force states that the JSF SDD MOU and PSFD MOU obligations will continue to be implemented based on the availability of funds. The decision not to include the F136 engine in RDT&E funding requests has been communicated to partners. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs may see changes in their stance on the need for a second engine. On September 3, 2010, British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox supported the F136 engine for the JSF program, expressing concerns about the long-term costs of canceling the second engine. Both JSF engines faced development challenges, with the F135 engine experiencing failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008 due to high-cycle fatigue. These engine malfunctions delayed the first flight of the F-35B aircraft. The F-35B aircraft's first flight was delayed due to engine failures, resulting in cost overruns. Pratt & Whitney identified damage to the F135 engine in a test, leading to minor modifications. The F136 engine also encountered test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage to turbine blades. GE initiated design changes to prevent further issues. In April 2011, Pratt & Whitney confirmed that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines were replaced with spares due to a misassembly issue. This issue was identified in a ground-test engine at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney for quality control deficiencies in July 2009, leading to a 24% increase in F135 costs. Pratt & Whitney responded to concerns about high scrap rates, stating that they are at 70 to 80 percent yield rate, which is where they should be in the program. They are running at a 97 percent scrap rate for the total engine. General Electric F136 achieved 115% of required thrust in testing. The future of the alternate engine program is in question, with Congress debating whether to continue or terminate it. Congressional appropriations have supported the program from various funding sources. The alternate engine program received funding from existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from the DOD topline. The source of funds could impact other DOD programs, potentially leading to a reduction in F-35 activities if funds are reallocated. Congress may need to decide on the future of the alternate engine program, considering the potential impact on the number of F-35s procured. The cost of developing the F136 engine for the F-35 program is estimated to require an additional $2.9 billion over the next six years. This cost does not include detailed estimates and could vary based on different assumptions. The funding for the alternate engine program could impact the number of F-35s procured and other defense capabilities. Developing the F136 engine for the F-35 program may have consequences on the current budget and lifetime costs. Supporters argue that competition could balance upfront costs with savings over the program's life, while others disagree. Congress must decide which assumptions to believe. Competition is seen as a check on cost growth, with contracts including incentives and penalties. The debate centers on whether the risk of a single engine type for the F-35 justifies procuring a second engine. Supporters of an alternate engine for the F-35 argue that having only one engine type poses a risk of all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues. The Marine Corps and Navy have experienced groundings due to engine problems in the past. However, DOD officials believe that terminating the alternate engine program poses little operational risk due to advancements in technology like computational fluid design and advanced software for engine health monitoring. Advanced software in engines can diagnose their own condition and provide pilots with warnings of impending failures, allowing for timely landings and cost-effective maintenance. Operational and logistical challenges may arise with multiple engines, as seen in the Navy's limited facilities. Air Force leaders express concerns about the practicality of using alternate engines, emphasizing the focus on the Air Force's needs. The Air Force has experience supporting multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets with the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for the F-35 or directing the entire buy to one engine. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines could be affected if the F136 engine is terminated. The engine debate centers on whether the Pentagon should pay GE to compete with Pratt. General Electric has a significant market share for commercial aircraft engines and supports various military aircraft engines. General Electric's strong position in the commercial engine market was highlighted in the CAIG and IDA studies of 2007. The studies noted that General Electric produced 1,000 commercial engines compared to Pratt & Whitney's 220. General Electric derives 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives 50%. Concerns were raised about the impact of terminating the F136 program on General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines. The termination could result in a loss of skilled military jet engineers and reduce the number of suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, potentially increasing vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The F135 and F136 engines compete for F-35 production, with concerns about supply chain disruptions. A 2007 study suggested having multiple vendors for each engine part. While terminating the F136 engine may not irreparably harm the U.S. industrial base, there are reservations about relying solely on a firm with a weak commercial presence for fighter engine production. The 2007 IDA study examined top F136 component suppliers and concluded that exiting the domestic industrial base due to F136 termination is unlikely. Competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney in the Great Engine War improved engine development. H.R. 1540 includes language on competitive development of F-35's engine and preserving existing F136 engines and tooling for research and development. The competitive procurement language in H.R. 1540 limits funds for performance improvements to the F-35 Lightning II aircraft propulsion system unless there is competitive development and production. Performance improvement refers to increasing airflow volume or thrust for better takeoff performance, excluding improvements in weight, costs, durability, and manufacturing efficiencies. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring that it can be restarted after a period of idleness, sustained long-term, and used for research and development at no cost to the Federal Government. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to develop a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system, allowing for research and development activities to be self-funded by the contractor. Additionally, the Secretary must identify any necessary contract modifications, facilities, or funding. The report also emphasizes the importance of incentivizing competition and prohibits the destruction or disposal of F-35 Lightning II aircraft program property. The committee supports the contractor's efforts to continue developing the F136 propulsion system despite the Department of Defense's cancellation of the program. They believe that competition for an alternative engine is crucial for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program, leading to better performance, contractor responsiveness, a stronger industrial base, increased reliability, and improved readiness. The Administration objects to limitations on funds for performance improvements to the F-35 propulsion system without competitive development. The Administration opposes the development of an extra engine for the F-35 program, citing significant extra costs and destabilization. They also object to the requirement to store and preserve property from the terminated F136 program, which would add unnecessary expenses during a period of fiscal restraint. The Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 on May 26, 2011. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine's research and development. The conference report on H.R. 1540 also addresses the preservation and storage of F136 assets. The system development contract requires the Secretary to preserve, store, and dispose of property for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. Funding for activities related to destroying assets is restricted. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the plan for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program within 120 days. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include funding for the F-35 alternate engine in the 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055) did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The legislative history of the program from FY1996-FY2010 is detailed in the appendix, focusing on final bill language and committee reports. The F-35 program was initially known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program in FY1996 and FY1997. Section 213 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 allocated $7 million for competitive engine concepts for the JAST program. The Senate report raised concerns about the program's ability to meet service needs and directed the inclusion of two propulsion concepts to reduce risk. The conferees shared these concerns and directed the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure proper planning for the JAST program. The conferees directed the Department of Defense to ensure engine competition and appropriate scale for the JAST program, with authorization of $7 million for competitive engine concepts. The Senate report emphasized the importance of supporting competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee directs the Secretary to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for the JAST program to avoid premature selection of a power plant manufacturer. The history of fighter engine propulsion plants shows challenges in developing new engines, with examples of dissatisfaction and costly upgrades in past models. The Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program is undergoing a redesign and has selected a single power plant design, a derivative of the F\u201322 engine. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends actively pursuing an engine design from a second manufacturer to ensure cost-effectiveness and competition. Additional funds have been provided for this purpose. The committee directs that remaining competition funds be rebaselined to guarantee integration into the preferred weapons system concept at the earliest practical point. H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208 was an omnibus appropriations act that included the DOD appropriations act. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3610 discussed the JAST program, recommending funds for the development of an alternate engine to be integrated into selected weapon systems contractor concepts. H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85 includes a report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program to be submitted by the Secretary of Defense to the congressional defense committees. In 1998, the Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the production and fielding sequence of joint strike fighter variants. The report should include a certification of sufficient funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about funding for the alternative fighter engine in the JSF program, emphasizing the need for a fully developed and flight-tested engine to reduce program risks and control costs. The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the Congressional defense committees by February 15, 1998, detailing funding for the JSF program to support full development and flight testing of the AFE. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase in the budget request of $28.0 million to accelerate the alternative engine program for the joint strike fighter, with expectations for future funding in fiscal year 1999 and beyond. The Armed Services Committee report on the JSF program discussed the order of fielding variants and the certification of funding for an alternate engine program. The committee noted the importance of timely submission and clear presentation of priorities, but expressed concern over delays in demonstrating the alternate engine in a JSF airframe. The committee recommends increasing the budget by $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program. The House Armed Services Committee report emphasizes the need for an alternate engine to control costs and reduce risks for the planned fleet of JSF aircraft. The Department's current funding levels for the alternative engine development are insufficient for timely completion. The committee recommends increasing funding by $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program. The justification for the requested increase is to reduce backlog of proposed engineering tasks for currently fielded engines. The committee does not consider the proposed increase to this program to be of higher priority than development of a new state-of-the-art alternative engine for JSF. The committee recommends $130.2 million in PE 27268F, a decrease of $30.0 million, and $265.4 million in PE 63800F, an increase of $30.0 million, directing the increase in JSF funding to be used only for acceleration of alternate engine development. The budget request included $476.6 million for the joint strike fighter (JSF) program, with $33.0 million allocated for the alternate engine program. The committee recommends an additional $15.0 million to accelerate the development of the alternate engine, bringing the total Air Force authorization to $250.4 million. The conference report expressed concerns about additional contractor funding needed for the JSF program's activities. The conferees are opposed to requiring industry to make additional investments in the JSF program beyond existing agreements. They view additional DEMVAL funding as necessary for project execution. The House Armed Services Committee supports the JSF alternate engine program. The committee supports the JSF alternate engine program and recommends funding to accelerate its development for compatibility with the JSF airframe. They recommend specific funding amounts to ensure completion of the alternate engine before lot five of the JSF production program. The Appropriations Committee report on S. 2593 and the FY2002 Defense Authorization Act discuss the JSF program and the Alternate Engine Program (AEP). The committee supports the AEP and expects no impact on its schedule or funding. The conferees express concerns about technical risks with the JSF engine and urge integration of the alternate engine before full rate production. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2586 also addresses the JSF alternate engine program. The budget request for the JSF alternate engine program included $769.5 million for the engineering and manufacturing development phase. The program aims to develop a family of aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allies with commonality among variants to minimize costs. The joint program office encourages two engine manufacturers to collaborate on common hardware components for interchangeable propulsion systems. Increased funding in fiscal year 2002 is recommended to reduce development schedule risk. The committee recommends additional funding to reduce development schedule risk of the JSF alternate engine common hardware components. Additional funding was also included in the FY2003 and FY2004 Defense Authorization Acts to support the Joint Strike Fighter Interchangeable Engine Program. The goal is to make the interchangeable engine available for competitive procurement as early as possible. The committee recommends increasing funding by $56.0 million to continue the F136 interchangeable engine development on its original schedule. The Department of Defense should make financial adjustments to restore the engine's schedule, as a previous cut resulted in a $56,000,000 reduction in research and development efforts for fiscal year 2004. The Committee recommends a total cut of $56,000,000 to the Joint Strike Fighter program, with the exception of the F136 engine program. The Committee also suggests restoring the fiscal year 2004 cut to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program and adding $20,000,000 for risk reduction. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and the funding of an alternate engine program for interchangeable engines. The committee supports engine production lot competition for the JSF program, emphasizing the importance of maintaining interchangeability between PW F135 and GE F136 engines. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act ensured funding for the competitive engine development program despite some opposition within the military services. A two-engine source is seen as the most cost-effective solution for the JSF's service life. The Secretary, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force are expected to continue developing competitive engines for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) as mandated by the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act. Section 211 of the Act requires the development and procurement of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the JSF by two separate contractors throughout its life cycle. Modifications to the acquisition program must adhere to this requirement. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act mandates the development of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) by two separate contractors. Any modifications to the acquisition program must comply with this requirement. Independent cost analyses of the JSF engine program are to be conducted by the Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center, and the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act mandates the development of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) by two separate contractors. Independent cost analyses of the JSF engine program are to be conducted by the Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center, and the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense, Comptroller General, and CEO of the research center must submit reports to Congress by March 15, 2007, detailing key assumptions, methodologies, and cost comparisons for alternative propulsion systems. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation criteria for the Joint Strike Fighter program, including cost analysis, manpower estimates, engine procurement, benefits of competition, and past acquisition program experiences. It also compares sole-source vs. competitive acquisition programs and considers the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base and the Department of Defense's ability to make competitive engine choices for future combat aircraft systems. It includes definitions of lifecycle costs and requirements for certifications in the report submission process. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and the development of the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine for the joint strike fighter (JSF). The committee believed that having a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be the most cost-effective and operationally effective solution. The House Armed Services Committee believed that having a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be the most cost-effective and operationally effective solution. The committee requested a review by the Government Accountability Office on the Department of Defense's analysis to terminate the JSF alternate engine program, which focused only on potential savings for engine acquisition and not on potential savings from competition for maintenance and operations over the engine's lifecycle. The committee supports continuing the JSF alternate engine program to fully analyze potential costs and savings over the engine's lifecycle. They recommend an increase of $408.0 million for fiscal year 2007 and require the Department of the Navy and Air Force to allocate funds for the program. Independent analyses are also mandated, with a report due by March 15, 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on S. 2766 emphasizes the need for modernization and transformation of the armed forces to confront irregular warfare threats. The committee supported various transformational activities, including authorizing funds for ship construction, promoting joint development of unmanned systems, and increasing funding for science and technology programs. Additionally, there is an emphasis on developing capabilities for coalition operations. The committee expressed concerns about engine competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program and directed the evaluation of two propulsion concepts. Despite legislative direction to maintain a two-engine program, the Department proposed eliminating the F136 engine. The committee added $400.8 million for the development of the interchangeable engine in fiscal year 2007 and directed the Secretary of Defense to sustain the program with two competitive propulsion systems. The report recommended continuing the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or a single firm-fixed-price contract for one system. This was in response to historical engine issues and the need for competition in engine development. The report recommended continuing the Joint Strike Fighter program with competitive propulsion systems to improve performance, reduce risk, and lower cost of ownership. Congress has consistently supported engine competition for the past 10 years due to concerns about lack of competition and operational and financial risks. Total JSF deliveries may exceed 4,000 aircraft worldwide, with significant propulsion business opportunities. The committee criticized the Department's analysis for terminating the F136 engine, stating it only accounted for 30% of engine costs and did not comply with economic analysis policy. They believe a full life cycle analysis would show cost savings through competition. The committee recommended independent life cycle cost analyses to provide a complete picture to Congress. The committee recommends an independent cost analysis for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program to compare the costs of two competitive propulsion systems throughout the aircraft's life cycle. They are concerned that the Department of Defense's analysis for terminating the F136 engine did not consider all costs over the aircraft's life cycle. The committee recommends supporting competitive propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter to reduce operational risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. They urge the Secretary of Defense, along with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force, to remain committed to this development. The committee suggests an increase in funding for the continued development of the F136 interchangeable engine. The conferees recommend a comprehensive independent cost analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, with a focus on comparing costs of the F-135 and F-136 engines, evaluating potential savings, and assessing the impact on the industrial base. The analysis should be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses and submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The conferees emphasize that the analysis should not be used as an excuse to not fully fund both engines in fiscal year 2008. The conferees recommend a comprehensive independent cost analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, focusing on comparing costs of the F-135 and F-136 engines, evaluating potential savings, and assessing the impact on the industrial base. The analysis should be conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses and submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The House Appropriations Committee report directs the Department of Defense to fund the continued development of both engines in the fiscal year 2008 budget submission while a cost analysis is ongoing. The analysis will compare costs of the F-135 and F-136 engines, evaluate potential savings, and assess the impact on the industrial base. It must be submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed disappointment in the lack of funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 2nd Engine Source in the fiscal year 2007 budget request. The Committee recommends additional funding for the F-35 engine competition to ensure the best value engine at the lowest price. They suggest allocating $170,000,000 to each of the Navy and Air Force Research, Development, Test and Evaluation accounts. The Department of Defense is directed to continue developing both engines in future budget submissions. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter Program. H.R. 4986 is a revised version of H.R. 1585, which was vetoed in 2007. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the need for a competitive JSF propulsion system program, specifically the development of the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee recommended an increase for the JSF competitive propulsion system, as required by the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. Studies conducted by various organizations were inconclusive on the financial benefits of developing a competitive engine program for the JSF. The committee recommended an increase of $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program, citing significant non-financial benefits such as better engine performance and improved operational readiness. This recommendation aligns with the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. The committee recommended an increase of $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program to develop and procure a competitive propulsion system for the JSF program. This aligns with the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee report discussed a proposed legislative provision for the Secretary of Defense to obligate sufficient annual amounts for the competitive JSF propulsion system. The committee recommended an increase of $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program to develop and procure a competitive propulsion system for the JSF program. This aligns with the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, which required an independent life cycle cost analysis of the JSF propulsion system, including a competitive engine program. The budget request did not include funds for the development of a competitive JSF propulsion system, but the program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the current F135 engine. The committee recommended a $480.0 million increase for the JSF competitive propulsion system program, citing non-financial benefits like better engine performance and increased operational readiness. This aligns with the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, which required a cost analysis of the JSF propulsion system. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3222 also discussed the JSF program. The report on H.R. 3222 recommended an increase of $200 million for F-35 production enhancements and $480 million for the development of an alternative engine. This funding is crucial for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3222 recommended funding for the development of an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was not fully supported by the Department of Defense in the fiscal year 2008 budget request. The Committee directed the Department of Defense to fully fund the engine development program in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission. The Committee recommends additional funding for the development of an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, citing the benefits of engine competition based on past experience with the F-16 Fighter program. They believe competition will lead to a more reliable, better performing, and lower cost engine, resulting in overall savings across the fighter program's life cycle. The Committee directs the Department of Defense to continue funding both engines in future budget submissions. The budget request included funding for the development of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) but did not allocate funds for a competitive JSF propulsion system. The committee recommended increases for the JSF competitive propulsion system in two consecutive reports, emphasizing the importance of engine competition for cost savings and performance improvements. The committee expressed disappointment that the Department of Defense did not include funds for a competitive propulsion system for the JSF in the budget request, despite the requirement in Public Law 110\u2013181. Witnesses provided an update on the JSF propulsion system cost analysis and the competitive engine program during a hearing on March 11, 2008. The GAO Director testified that the Department of Defense would recoup its initial investment costs with program savings of 9-11%. The committee believes a competitive propulsion system for the JSF offers long-term savings, despite hardware failures with the currently planned F135 engine. The committee recommends $1.8 billion for the continued development of the competitive JSF propulsion system program, citing engine failures with the F135 engine and emphasizing the benefits of a competitive program for improved engine performance and operational readiness. The committee recommends $167.9 million for advance procurement of competitive JSF propulsion system long-lead components for F-35 in the Air Force. The Department of Defense is urged to include funds for continued development and procurement of a competitive JSF propulsion system in the fiscal year 2010 budget request, as directed by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The committee recommends increasing funding for long lead items for the F-136 engine by $35.0 million. Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee is disappointed with the administration's failure to fund the competitive propulsion system and recommends an increase of $215.0 million for its development. The report discusses the funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, including the addition of $820.0 million for the F136 engine to ensure fair competition. The Department of Defense froze the technology baseline of the F135 engine, and it is recommended to invest in both F135 and F136 engine programs for technology insertion. The committee suggests using new composite materials in the F135 engine program for cost savings. No funds were allocated for the F136 engine in the administration's budget request. The committee recommended an increase of $430.0 million for the development of the F-136 engine to maintain fair competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program. Additionally, $35.0 million was recommended for F135 engine technology development. The FY2009 DOD Appropriations Act included funding for the F-136 engine within the Navy and Air Force's Joint Strike Fighter development programs. The Secretary of Defense is directed to fully fund the F-136 engine development and procurement efforts in the FY2010 budget submission. The Senate amendment increases funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and management reserves for the F-35 program, while prohibiting funds for an alternate propulsion system until certain conditions are met. The House bill includes provisions to limit obligations for the F-35 program until certain conditions are met, and to ensure full funding for the development of a competitive propulsion system. Both the House and Senate agree to authorize the budget request for 30 F-35 aircraft. The conferees agree to authorize the budget request for 30 F-35 aircraft in Aircraft Procurement, Navy, and Aircraft Procurement, Air Force. They also authorize an increase of $430.0 million in RDT&E for F136 engine development and $130.0 million in Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, for F136 engine procurement. The Secretary of Defense is expected to comply with the direction in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 to ensure the development and competitive production of the F-35 propulsion system. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $122 million in Navy aircraft procurement funding for the procurement of F-35Bs and Cs. The curr_chunk discusses various changes in funding for the F-35 program, including reductions and increases in procurement funding for aircraft, engines, and spares. The Navy and Air Force see both decreases and increases in funding for different aspects of the program. Overall, there is a net increase of $153.5 million in Navy research and development funding for the F-35 program. The curr_chunk discusses a net increase of $153.5 million in Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program, with changes in funding for the F136 alternate engine and program excess. H.R. 2647 contains provisions related to the F-35 alternate program, including limitations on the obligation of FY2010 funds until certain conditions are met. The curr_chunk discusses the certification of funds for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II. It includes requirements for reports and annual plans to be submitted to the congressional defense committees. Section 242 emphasizes the inclusion of sufficient amounts in the annual budget request for the continued development and procurement of the propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget submitted to Congress. Additionally, the Secretary must ensure that future-years defense programs include enough funding for the propulsion system. Funds for research, development, test, and evaluation of the F-35 Lightning II Program must be obligated and expended each fiscal year. The Defense Department must allocate sufficient annual funds for the development and procurement of two propulsion system options for the F-35 Lightning II to ensure competitiveness. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is amended to remove section 213 related to Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is working on the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, noting that the Department of Defense has not complied with the requirement to include funds for this purpose in the budget request. The F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth since its inception in fiscal year 2002. The F135 engine development program, which began in 2002, was initially expected to cost $4.828 billion but has since increased to $6.7 billion by the end of 2008. This represents a 38% cost increase. The F135 engine procurement costs for the F-35 variants have also seen significant growth, ranging from 38% to 47%. In contrast, the F136 engine program has not experienced any cost growth since its inception in 2002. The committee is concerned about the Department's decision not to include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests despite F135 cost increases and test failures. They believe that a two-engine competitive program would offer better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The committee recommends a total increase of $463.0 million for the competitive F-35 propulsion system program development. The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $603 million for the development and procurement of the alternative F136 engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that funding a second engine is unnecessary and hinders the progress of the overall program. The Air Force operates several fleets with single-engine sources, minimizing risks of fleet-wide grounding. The Administration opposes limiting JSF development funding until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the F136 alternate engine. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including $219.45 million for the F136 alternate engine and a reduction of $78 million for excess management reserves. Section 211 of S. 1390 requires the Department to obligate sufficient funds for the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The committee recommends funding the F136 alternate engine for the F-35 Lightning II program in FY2010, emphasizing the importance of continuing the development of a competitive propulsion system despite inconclusive financial benefits. The committee recommends an increase of $438.9 million for continuing the JSF competitive propulsion system program, citing significant non-financial factors such as better engine performance and improved operational readiness. The recommendation for additional Navy and Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 alternate engine was approved in full-committee markup by a vote of 12\u201310. The Administration strongly opposes adding $438.9 million for the alternative engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). They argue that the current engine is performing well and that the risks of having a single engine provider are manageable based on past programs. They also object to limiting overall JSF development funding until a certification is provided for the alternative engine program. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve funding for an alternate engine program for the F-35, opting instead to remove the additional research and development funding. The amended bill now aligns with the Administration's proposal to not fund the alternate program until cost-effectiveness certifications are provided by the Secretary of Defense. S.Amdt. 1767, S. 1390 aligns with the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program. It includes provisions to ensure funding for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 and reallocates funding from other programs to support this initiative. The FY2009 supplemental appropriations act (H.R. 2346 / P.L. 111-32) includes provisions for the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. Funding for the program requires a written certification from the Secretary of Defense before 90% of the allocated amount can be obligated. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement. The FY2009 supplemental appropriations act includes provisions for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with increased funding for management reserves. The amount allocated for aircraft procurement for the Air Force is decreased to fund the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. S.Amdt. 1627 aims to eliminate restrictions on obligating funds for the F-35 program in FY2010. The text chunk discusses a proposal to limit the use of funds for an alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in FY2010. It also includes provisions to increase funding for procurement and make certain certifications regarding the cost effectiveness of the program. The text chunk outlines limitations on funds for an alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, requiring certification for cost-effectiveness and operational readiness. It also includes increased funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement. The text chunk allocates additional funds for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement and restores management reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) decreases funding for Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter F136 development by $219,450,000. The bill was signed into law on December 19, 2009, as P.L. 111-118. The explanatory statement for the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Additionally, Air Force and Navy research and development funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program saw increases, with concerns persisting about the program's progress. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program faces cost growth and schedule issues, with the Department of Defense insisting it is on track. The program is allocated $6,840,478,000 in funding, designated as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure procurement of all 30 aircraft as requested, with a report on findings due to congressional defense committees by January 15, 2010. The Committee recommends a net increase of $18.6 million in Air Force procurement funding for the F-35 program, with reductions in non-recurring engineering and increases for the alternate engine. They also support realistic budgeting and express concerns about terminating programs prematurely. The Committee believes that terminating some programs prematurely is not advisable and sees potential benefits in continuing certain efforts, such as the presidential helicopter and Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine. The F-35 program is crucial for tactical aviation, with plans to procure over 2,500 stealthy aircraft. Despite initial plans for two engine variants, all F-35 aircraft will now be powered by the same engine for simpler logistics. The Committee is concerned about potential problems with the F-35 engine, which could ground the entire fleet of aircraft and limit flexibility in times of crisis. They also highlight the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, despite the potential for cost savings through an engine competition. The Committee is puzzled by the Department's decision to not fund the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. They recommend an additional $560 million for the development and production of the alternate engine, stating that a dual source engine strategy is the most cost-effective method moving forward. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests. The Administration strongly objects to the additional funding for the alternate engine program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the F-35 alternate engine development, despite the House including $485 million for it in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act. The current engine is performing well, and the risks of a single engine provider are manageable. The President's senior advisors would recommend a veto if the final bill disrupts the F-35 program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends limiting the obligation of funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until certification that all funds for a competitive propulsion system have been obligated. Additionally, procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft is contingent on meeting certain criteria. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends limiting funds for the F-35 program until certification that all funds for a competitive propulsion system have been obligated. Procurement of over 30 aircraft is subject to specific conditions, including certifications and testing requirements for the F136 engines. The Secretary of Defense must also include alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends budgeting for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the annual budget request and future-years defense program to ensure continued development and procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends budgeting for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft to ensure continued development and procurement. The Secretary of Defense is required to obligate and expend funds for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system to support competitive production. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends budgeting for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must designate the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. This designation imposes stricter oversight and reporting requirements. The Secretary of Defense must designate the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Milestone B decision will serve as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Actions following critical cost growth will be subject to restructuring the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The Secretary of Defense must designate the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, must be met for designated major subprograms, with reassessment and actions required upon enactment. If programmatic changes cause cost growth exceeding the threshold, the subprogram will not meet the requirements. The budget request for the F-35 aircraft development did not include funds for a competitive F-35 propulsion program. The budget request for the F-35 aircraft did not include funds for a competitive F-35 propulsion system, despite the committee's recommendations for the past four years. Congress has appropriated funds for this purpose, but the Department of Defense has chosen not to comply with the law requiring the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35. The committee report highlighted cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines. The Government Accountability Office reported a 50% increase in F135 engine development costs. The negotiated prices for F-35B and F-35A engines were higher than budget estimates. A Joint Assessment Team reviewed the F135 cost structure and concluded that improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment by the contractor for cost reduction initiatives. The Deputy Secretary of Defense updated the 2007 DOD report on the Joint Strike Fighter Alternate Engine Acquisition, stating that $2.9 billion would be needed for F136 engine development. The committee questions the Department's decision not to include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests, despite potential benefits like better engine performance and increased reliability. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the F-35 competitive engine program due to improved contractor responsiveness, industrial base robustness, engine reliability, and operational readiness. The F-35 program faced challenges in meeting cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews like the Joint Estimating Team (JET) and an independent manufacturing review team (IMRT). JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion cost increase, while IMRT identified high production ramp rates as high risk. The Department of Defense plans to reduce production risk for the F-35 program by procuring an additional test aircraft, setting up a software simulation facility, using operational F-35s for testing, adjusting production profiles, and increasing budget allocations. These actions are expected to delay development by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more. The program is projected to exceed unit cost thresholds by over 50% compared to the original estimate. The F-35 program is described as having unprecedented concurrency in development and testing. The F-35 program faces challenges with late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic development plans. The Department of Defense intends to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. This procurement plan represents over 22% of the total planned 2,443 F-35s before testing is complete. The committee recommends reducing the F-35 production ramp rate until developmental testing is complete. They suggest authorizing 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, with certain milestones to be met. The committee recommends a provision for the Under Secretary of Defense to certify milestones before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The Administration opposes adding $485 million for the extra engine program and associated provisions limiting JSF development funding. The Department does not believe that the $2.4 billion investment in an extra engine for the JSF program will ever be recovered. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The committee recommends a certification requirement before further funding is allocated for the alternate engine. The Department of Defense would need to certify that developing an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs and improve fleet readiness without disrupting the program or reducing aircraft procurement. H.R. 6523 did not specify funding for the alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft within 30 days. The Milestone B decision will serve as the original baseline for reporting requirements. If restructuring occurs for the F-35 aircraft program, the F-35 engine program must also undergo reassessment and actions. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act states that actions taken to meet requirements for a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) must comply with section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. If programmatic changes cause a significant increase in program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost, the requirements of section 2433a will not be considered met. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee reported $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine in the FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act. The Senate version did not include funds for the program, but had positive comments. A continuing resolution maintained FY2010 spending levels until March 24, 2011, when a stop-work order was issued. The House later voted to eliminate $450 million for the alternate engine program. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) provided funding for DOD for the remainder of FY2011, excluding funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in establishing an alternate engine program for the F-35 may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 for Air Force F-16 fighter engines. Congress funded General Electric through the Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP) to develop the F101 engine (later F110) as an alternate engine for the F-16. The competition between F110 and F100 engines led to improved durability and reliability. Annual competitions for engine procurement were controversial but believed to result in better engines and contract terms. Contractor responsiveness was seen as the primary benefit of the competition. The Great Engine War resulted in better warranties and engine quality assurance. The competition led to Pratt & Whitney offering early engine improvements to the Air Force. The Air Force demanded cost projections from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for six years, leading to firm-fixed price contracts for the first production lot. This approach was a departure from previous practices and resulted in improved contract terms and contractor responsiveness. The DOD required contractors to provide cost projections and plans for dual sources of critical parts to avoid disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the program's schedules. The U.S. Department of Defense terminated the GE Rolls-Royce F136 engine development program, which was almost 80 percent complete. Despite offering to self-fund development through fiscal year 2012, the program has now ended. The F136 program had accumulated over 1,200 hours of testing before termination, with the FET consistently delivering on cost and schedule. GE and Rolls-Royce were leading advocates of defense acquisition reform during the program. McCormick emphasized the importance of competition in defense acquisition reform, supported by military experts and bipartisan backers over the years."
