    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as significant contributors to resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste production. Their construction, operation, and demolition processes have a substantial environmental impact, affecting both ecosystems and human health. Buildings produce substantial waste streams throughout their lifecycles, impacting the environment and finances. They account for 40% of energy consumption in the US, leading to high greenhouse gas emissions and costing consumers over $430 billion annually. Location and design influence ecological and human health impacts, affecting stormwater management and transportation energy. Indoor air quality also affects occupant health and productivity. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in buildings, aiming to reduce pollutants and improve indoor air quality. It has gained interest since the 1990s and involves various stakeholders like construction firms, building owners, and government agencies. This report discusses the concept, federal policies, and programs related to green building. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the Committee on the Environment and the U.S. Green Building Council. The concept has expanded to promote environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment. Green building efforts vary along a design and performance continuum, with some practices barely distinguishable from standard building practices. The term \"greenwashing\" is used to describe practices that are purely for marketing. On the other hand, some practitioners aim to greatly reduce the environmental impacts of buildings, such as zero-impact and minus-impact buildings. Green building is characterized as an integrated approach that significantly reduces the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. Green building is a relative concept that involves integration across various factors to improve environmental performance. Techniques range from innovative technologies to design features influencing occupant behavior. Decisions on these techniques impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle, making green building most common in new construction. Green building is often associated with sustainable building and high-performance building. Sustainable building aims to maintain small environmental footprints indefinitely, while high-performance building includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions emphasize attributes like energy efficiency, durability, and occupant productivity. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 refined the concept of high-performance green buildings by establishing detailed definitions. Green building focuses on elements such as energy, water, materials, waste, and health, as well as siting considerations like transportation and ecology. Serviceability, productivity, and functionality may also be integral to high-performance building design. The objectives for high-performance buildings include disaster and climate resilience, influenced by natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Green building projects prioritize elements based on stakeholder needs and expected occupants. Local factors like climate zone and flood risk impact design, with a reduced energy footprint being a key focus through energy efficiency and conservation techniques. Energy efficiency measures in buildings include lighting, weatherization, and use of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal power. Federal law mandates reductions in energy use for federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. Despite progress, energy consumption in 2015 exceeded the federal goal. Energy is crucial due to economic costs and environmental impacts, with buildings using the best technologies consuming half as much energy as current buildings. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in the management of water resources, especially in arid areas. Measures such as reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and landscaping can help achieve these reductions. Water management also includes handling rain, on-site water, and run-off, with low-impact development focusing on natural and engineered techniques to control stormwater. The choice and use of materials in building construction and operations can significantly impact the environmental footprint, affecting resource depletion, pollution, embodied energy, and health. Environmentally preferable materials, such as those with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can reduce environmental impact and health risks. There is ongoing debate about what constitutes environmentally preferable materials due to inconsistencies in measurement methodologies and vocabulary. The environmental impacts of a building's waste stream can be reduced through waste-reduction efforts like source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Landscaping can also help by reducing chemical pollutants and recycling waste. High-efficiency boilers and furnaces can reduce atmospheric pollutants, while operational solid waste can be recycled to lessen environmental impact. Factors like indoor air pollutants can affect the health impacts of buildings. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for occupant health, impacted by pollutants like mold, radon, carbon monoxide, asbestos, and VOCs. Techniques to maintain high IAQ include ventilation, air filtration, and using materials without toxic substances. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) considers factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and design. Building location affects environmental footprint, with considerations for transportation hubs, ecological sensitivity, and orientation for heating and cooling efficiency. Green building design considers factors like proximity to trees and plantings, climate-related risks, and productivity of occupants. Studies show that indoor environmental quality (IEQ) influences worker comfort and productivity, with green buildings potentially leading to improved productivity. However, trade-offs between serviceability and other elements can occur in certified green buildings. Serviceability is an important but often overlooked aspect of green building design. As a key element in green building design, resilience to hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, and flooding is crucial for high-performance buildings. This includes practices such as resistant construction, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling capabilities. Climate-resilient design is also emphasized to prepare for severe weather events and climate change. Integration across elements and stages is essential in green building to improve performance and minimize trade-offs. The focus on whole building design in green building practices aims to improve performance in various impact areas and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. Integration and balance among different goals and elements are crucial, with the use of information technology in building operations playing a key role. It is important to address both energy efficiency and health considerations to avoid counterproductive outcomes. Addressing energy efficiency and health in green building practices requires a balance between different factors. Prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary due to constraints or priorities. Choices made in one stage of a building's life cycle can impact other stages, highlighting the importance of considering the overall optimization. For example, while concrete walls provide better insulation than wood, they have higher carbon dioxide emissions. It is crucial to consider the environmental impacts of different building materials and prioritize energy-efficient operations over construction methods. A green building approach can reduce problems by assessing the impact of actions on different stages. Elements like environmentally preferable products can affect occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy generation prepares buildings for power outages, while stormwater management provides ecological services. Various systems and tools exist to evaluate green and sustainable buildings, falling into categories like rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Determining a building's green or sustainable status is complex due to the interconnected elements involved. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points based on criteria in various design categories, resulting in an overall score and tier ranking. Certification validates that a building meets specified requirements, with objectivity achieved through independent assessment and validation. The certification for green buildings is conducted by independent third parties, such as the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) with their LEED certification system. LEED has become a widely recognized benchmark for green building design, with over 37,300 commercial buildings certified worldwide as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories, including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. Operations and maintenance certification is also available for existing buildings. LEED certification, offered by the U.S. Green Building Council, focuses on six green building elements and has a five-year recertification cycle. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a designated number of points for optional items to achieve certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. LEED v4, the most recent version, was released in November 2013. Other green building rating systems are also used in the United States. The BREEAM In-Use certification system, introduced in the United States in 2017, allows existing commercial buildings to benchmark performance and certify improvements without prerequisites. Ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding, based on scores across nine impact categories. Certifications must be renewed annually. Green Globes, developed in Canada, is based on BREEAM and offers one to four Globes based on performance. Green Globes certification offers one to four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building, Petal, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in seven performance areas, Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three Petals, and Zero Energy Certification requires on-site energy generation without combustion. The Living Building Challenge certification requires a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different green building ratings systems emphasize various aspects and may be more suitable depending on local conditions. Additional programs like Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Passive House/ PHIUS+ certify buildings for specific environmental performance areas. Several federal statutes and policies impose green building requirements on federal offices and agencies, recommending the use of third-party green certification systems. The General Services Administration (GSA) suggests using these systems to simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. Some agencies have established internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense (DOD), to identify a third-party certification system that encourages a comprehensive and environmentally-sound approach to certifying green buildings. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and DOD, recommended using either LEED or Green Globes for green building certification. Federal agencies should aim for a LEED Silver rating or Two Globes under the Green Globes system for new construction and major renovation projects. The 2014 Department of Energy rulemaking established minimum criteria for rating systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states and local jurisdictions also require green building certification for government and commercial buildings. Green building rating and certification systems have influenced model building codes and standards. Building codes set minimum requirements for design and construction, covering various aspects beyond health and safety. Energy efficiency standards are not discussed here. Federal, state, and local governments determine the contents of building codes. Green building codes go beyond minimum building code requirements and can be adopted by state and local governments. They may be mandatory or voluntary and often incorporate technical standards created by recognized organizations. Green building standards are guidelines and criteria for judging a building's sustainability. They can be achieved through prescriptive, performance, or outcome-based pathways. These standards are often written in code-enforceable language and may be adopted by jurisdictions. Accreditation by organizations like ANSI is typically required for the development of these standards. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredits green building standards to ensure adherence to approved procedures. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building codes in the US. The ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, which can be adopted alongside other ICC codes for building safety. The most recent revision was in 2015, offering municipalities various compliance pathways. The IgCC offers various compliance pathways for building requirements, covering most building types except low-rise residential buildings. Low-rise residential builders are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have jointly released Standard 189.1 for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, focusing on site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. In 2015, the ICC and ASHRAE partnered to integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. Federal laws and policies also support green building efforts, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 requiring recycled content in products. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings. EPACT 2005 aimed to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings by 20% by 2015, promote energy-efficient products procurement, set energy consumption targets for new federal buildings, and require sustainable design principles for new federal buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) set energy-efficiency goals for state plans, authorized funding for energy-efficient appliances, established the Energy Star labeling program, and mandated energy and water conservation standards for products. It also directed agencies to purchase Energy Star labeled products, set standards for public housing, and provided tax incentives for energy and water conservation. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provided tax incentives for energy and water efficiency, set efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, and increased funding for low-income families for weatherization. It also required energy-efficient lighting in GSA facilities and established energy-efficiency standards for residential, commercial, federal buildings. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) established energy-efficiency standards for manufactured housing and commercial buildings, including zero-net-energy buildings. It increased the required reduction in total energy consumption of federal buildings to 30% by 2015 and set goals for new construction to reach a 65% reduction by 2015 and zero-net energy use by 2030. EISA also included water-conservation guidelines, stormwater runoff requirements, and the use of green building certification systems. Agencies must commission new building equipment to operate at design specifications and measure energy and water savings. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) directed federal agencies to install advanced metering devices in buildings, report energy use data, and undergo regular evaluations. Energy costs assessment extended to 40 years, new equipment must be energy efficient, and energy-efficient lighting accelerated in GSA facilities. Leased federal buildings require an Energy Star label, and an Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings was established. GAO audits implementation, and provisions for greening schools and energy-efficiency assistance for state and local public buildings were included. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandated energy efficiency measures for federal agencies, including advanced metering devices, energy use reporting, and evaluations. It also required updated energy-efficiency standards for public housing and established green building research projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for converting GSA facilities to high-performance green buildings. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-11) directed GSA to develop model leasing provisions to promote energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. It also included provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces, such as studying the feasibility of energy-efficient measures and collecting occupant energy-use information. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 directed GSA to develop model leasing provisions to promote energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. It also included provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces and establishing energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters. President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 in 2015, setting new sustainability goals for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025. President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 in 2015, setting new sustainability targets for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025. Targets include reducing building energy intensity, potable water consumption intensity, and increasing clean energy production. The order also called for climate-resilient design elements in federal buildings and compliance with revised Guiding Principles for Sustainable Buildings. Compliance efforts led to an 18% increase in federal sustainable buildings between FY2014 and FY2015. Between FY2014 and FY2015, there was an 18% increase in federal sustainable buildings. In 2006, representatives of 19 federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding titled \"Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings,\" which included core Guiding Principles for green building design. The federal government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the United States, costing nearly $6.1 billion in energy bills. The Guiding Principles were revised in 2008 and 2016 to address a broader set of issues, including climate change risks. The federal government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the United States, costing nearly $6.1 billion in energy bills. EISA and other policy instruments require federal agencies to implement green building practices. GSA manages 425 million square feet of space in over 8,500 buildings, aiming for LEED certification at the Gold level for new construction and major renovations by 2020. By 2020, GSA aims for all new buildings to achieve net-zero energy, water, or waste, surpassing Executive Order 13693 requirements. The Green Proving Ground program evaluates next-generation building technologies for deployment across GSA properties. Various offices within GSA contribute to green building efforts, including the Energy Program, Environment Program, Leasing Program, Office of Design and Construction, and the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings. This office coordinates activities related to high-performance green buildings across federal agencies, providing actionable information to improve building performance and maintaining the Sustainable Facilities Tool (SF Tool) website for green resources. The Facility Management Institute and green-building programs at GSA collaborate with other agencies. EISA directs the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to provide recommendations for federal green building requirements. GSA and DOE cochair the Interagency Sustainable Working Group to report on agency progress towards E.O. 13693 goals. GSA participates in climate adaptation planning for buildings. GSA collaborates with other agencies on green building programs and climate adaptation planning. DOE is involved in green building activities related to energy efficiency through various programs like BTO and FEMP. The Building Technologies Office (BTO) aims to reduce energy use intensity in U.S. buildings by 50% compared to 2010 levels. They focus on developing cost-effective net-zero energy buildings for residential and commercial sectors through programs like Building America, Commercial Buildings Integration, Better Buildings Alliance, and Energy Star in collaboration with EPA. The U.S. commercial building community utilizes Energy Star and Zero Energy Ready Home programs for energy efficiency. The Building Performance Database offers public access to commercial building energy performance data. The Federal Energy Management Program assists federal agencies in implementing energy savings and sustainable building design. The DOE, EPA, and other agencies are involved in collecting data and funding R&D for green buildings. EPA's programs include Energy Star and WaterSense for energy and water efficiency. EPA also supports renewable energy procurement through the Green Power Partnership. The WaterSense program was established in 2006 to promote water efficiency by certifying products and professionals. Green Infrastructure Collaborative promotes green stormwater management practices. The Sustainable Materials Management Program encourages reducing environmental impacts from materials use. WasteWise is a partnership to prevent waste and increase recycling. The EPA supports various programs to promote environmental sustainability, including the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Program, Comprehensive Procurement Guideline program, and Health initiatives such as R&D for safer chemicals. They also focus on Indoor Air Quality and Siting efficiency through programs like Indoor airPLUS and the Smart Location Database. The Department of Defense (DOD) has the largest building footprint in the federal government, with over 276,000 buildings covering 2.2 billion square feet worldwide. DOD issues requirements for its buildings under the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) program, including green building standards outlined in UFC 1-200-02 and UFC 3-210-10. The Department of Defense (DOD) mandates compliance with green building standards outlined in UFC criteria and sets goals for sustainability through the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP). Various branches within DOD have their own green building initiatives, such as the Army's Net Zero Installations project and the Air Force's use of Sustainability Development Indicators for environmental impact assessment. The DOD and EPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2016 to implement sustainable military installations and promote innovative technologies. The Federal Chief Sustainability Officer position was established in 1993 and expanded to include green building requirements. NIST's Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Manufacturing Program focuses on measurement science and data improvements. The NIST Sustainable Buildings and Infrastructure Program focuses on improving measurement science and data for intelligent building systems, sustainable materials, and net-zero energy buildings with high indoor air quality. It includes the Net-Zero Energy High-Performance Buildings Program, the Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility, and the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability software tool. NIST also contributes resources on climate resiliency for buildings to the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers programs promoting green building elements in public housing, such as the Mark-to-Market program and Energy Efficient Mortgage Program. They also provide funding for energy and water efficiency improvements and run the Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes Program to reduce home health hazards. The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts on market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The construction industry in the U.S. is a significant part of the economy, with green building making up a growing percentage of the market. In 2005, only 2% of new construction was green, but by 2013, it had grown to 20%. Green construction spending in the United States has been growing faster than general construction spending, tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. Green building activities are projected to generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018. New institutional construction, driven by certification requirements, is expected to fuel future growth. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is increasing, with 38% of office space certified by LEED or Energy Star in 2016. However, a large portion of U.S. buildings still do not meet green criteria, making rapid retrofitting challenging. Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance by affecting construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The perceived higher initial costs of green buildings can be a barrier to their implementation, leading to limited empirical evidence on their financial performance. Higher costs can result from features like high-efficiency appliances and high-performance windows. Green buildings may have higher initial costs due to features like high-efficiency appliances and high-performance windows, but evidence suggests that construction costs are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design can lead to cost reductions, and operational savings from reduced utility usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid can offset initial investments. GSA claims to have saved over $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements between FY2008 and FY2015. Between FY2008 and FY2015, green certification led to reduced utility expenses, supported by numerous studies. However, utility costs only make up 19% of a commercial building's operating costs, and the impact of green certification on overall expenses is uncertain. Green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market, but certain factors like short-term ownership or leasing can hinder the financial return on green building investments. The return on investments for tenants in green building renovations may be limited by constraints on capital availability. Financial incentives from states and municipalities can help offset higher initial costs, making green building investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept includes social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones when assessing business. In evaluating green building efforts, it is important to distinguish between design and performance. While much focus has been on design and construction specifications, the actual environmental performance of green buildings is not always incorporated into certification requirements. Factors such as inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use can impact the performance of a green building post-occupancy. This raises questions about whether a nominally green building will perform significantly better or worse than a conventional building. Studies have shown examples of certified green buildings that are resource-intensive post-occupancy. Studies have shown that green buildings may not always perform as efficiently as expected post-occupancy due to factors like building size and increased energy usage. The discrepancy between predicted and actual energy performance, known as the \"performance gap,\" is a concern in the construction industry. Rating systems are now focusing more on post-occupancy performance assessment to address these issues. Critiques of certification systems include the need for building-level energy and water meters to track performance for the first five years. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification incorporate performance parameters. Building codes are shifting towards outcome-based compliance, with commissioning being a key process to ensure environmental performance. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) for sustainability. An organization can develop an environmental management system (EMS) with international standards for certification. The EMS must include an explicit environmental policy with commitments to conform to requirements, improve performance, and prevent pollution. Performance measurement in EMS can help meet these commitments. Building monitoring tools like GSAlink can detect faults in equipment and provide resource analytics for effective management. Studies on green building performance face challenges due to lack of consensus on criteria and outcomes. Studies on green building performance have faced challenges due to a lack of consensus on criteria and outcomes. Recent research has shown that green buildings exhibit a wide range of energy performance, with some performing below expectations. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings, but about one in seven performed worse than average. Follow-up assessments showed that energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. The GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most LEED-certified, showed better performance than the national average in energy use, water use, costs, satisfaction, and emissions. However, 9 out of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings did not meet energy consumption requirements, with most using more electricity than the national average. Arizona's LEED-certified buildings also underperformed in energy use compared to simulations. Overall, these studies suggest a lack of clear performance improvements with LEED certification. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in measuring the performance of green buildings, highlighting the lack of sufficient evidence to conclude that LEED certification consistently reduces building energy consumption. Access to building performance data is limited, hindering comprehensive assessments. Methods for measuring performance are not well-developed, with some elements being easier to quantify than others. The importance of performance measurement is emphasized for ensuring environmental targets are met and improving them. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in measuring building performance, including disagreements on relevant metrics like EUI and the impact of different measurement methodologies. The importance of accurate performance measurement is highlighted, especially considering the long life expectancy of buildings. Measurement of building performance is crucial for long-term environmental sustainability. Federal agencies are required to measure their buildings' energy performance against specific targets, with more stringent requirements for new construction. However, challenges exist in determining accurate baselines and obtaining reliable data. Consensus on measurement goals and metrics is lacking, making effective application difficult. Research in measurement science for green buildings is ongoing. The National Science and Technology Council identified the need for measurement science in green building research. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics for building sustainability. Federal agencies track progress towards green building goals through annual sustainability scorecards. Scorecards assess areas like GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, and fleet petroleum use, with color-coded scores indicating progress. Federal progress towards green building and energy intensity goals is discussed. Agencies are assessed based on color-coded scores - green for meeting or on track, yellow for some progress, and red for lack of progress. Some agencies have surpassed the 15% compliance target for green buildings, while others are making progress. However, many agencies did not meet the 30% energy intensity reduction goal by 2015. Government-wide energy intensity only declined by 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year starting from FY2016. The goal for potable water intensity reduction was changed in 2015 to a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Some agencies have already achieved the earlier goal, with concerns raised about the certification process for green building rating systems. Critics argue that many systems lack caps on performance metrics, making sustainability claims relative. Some argue that current green building practices lack integration and are too incremental. There is a call for new approaches that focus on ecosystem services and go beyond individual buildings. Concerns exist that some builders may not fully embrace a forward-thinking, integrative approach to green building design. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base in green building makes it challenging to identify the most appropriate approaches, highlighting the need for further research. Issues with current green building practices include lack of integration and incremental approaches. There is a need for new methods focusing on ecosystem services beyond individual buildings. Challenges arise in identifying objective criteria for elements like siting, which are not easily quantifiable. Congress faces questions on the effectiveness of federal green building programs, coordination among agencies, extending efforts nationwide, prioritizing elements like siting, and promoting scientific and technical knowledge growth in green building. Congressional action could involve appropriations and new statutory requirements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released reports on federal green building efforts, highlighting the need for coordination and assessment of initiatives. Congress should examine the performance and efficiency of agency green building programs and their impact on nationwide adoption. Coordination among agencies and integration of efforts are crucial for promoting green building practices. Some federal agencies support mortgages promoting energy efficiency, with potential measures for Congress to consider including stronger incentives, broadening incentives to include green building elements, funding rebate programs, and enhancing green building efforts within federal agencies. Regulatory actions may be complicated by federalism issues and regional requirements. Congress may need to evaluate the integration and harmonization of green building programs within agencies like EPA and DOE. Energy efficiency is a key focus due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and high energy usage in buildings. Congress should ensure a balanced approach to green building elements and consider if current incremental efforts are sufficient to meet national needs. Additionally, the development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building should be supported. Development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building is underfunded, with federal and private-sector R&D funding levels below optimal. Green building received less than 0.5% of federal nondefense R&D funding in 2007, and construction sector investment in R&D is low. Congress should consider modifying funding levels and priorities, creating incentives for private-sector R&D, and improving training and education in relevant areas of expertise. The availability of training and education for green building expertise is crucial for ensuring a knowledgeable workforce for construction and operation of federal green buildings, schools, and hospitals."
