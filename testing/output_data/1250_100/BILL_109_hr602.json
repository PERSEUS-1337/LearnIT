    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress finds that prior to December 7, 1956, retired members of the uniformed services were led to believe they would receive fully paid lifetime health care. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision in Schism v. United States emphasized the need for Congress to fulfill these promises made to military members from 1941 to 1956. The first health care insurance act for military members excluded older retirees. Retired officers from World War II and Korean War era were promised free health care for life, but the court upheld the judgment against their breach-of-contract claim as Congress never ratified the promise. Only Congress can fulfill the promises made in good faith to military members from that era. Statutes enacted in 1956 allowed those who entered service on or after December 7, 1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected disability to medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed services. Recruiters and officers continued to mislead members about entitlement to fully paid lifetime health care despite regulations limiting medical care availability. Base closures and military medical treatment drawdowns occurred between 1988 and 1995. The failure to provide adequate health care for military retirees is hindering their ability to recommend military service as a career. While some provisions have extended coverage to older retirees, those under 65 are still lacking in healthcare support. The US should fulfill promises made to veterans and ensure high-quality healthcare for all retired uniformed service members. SEC. 3.
