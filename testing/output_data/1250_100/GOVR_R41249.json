    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws aim to provide equal coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed three general approaches to achieving parity in mental health coverage: mandated coverage with parity, mandated coverage without parity, and parity coverage without mandated coverage. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions that mandate coverage for certain plans. The ACA does not modify the federal mental health parity requirements themselves but expands their applicability to specific financing arrangements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions that mandate coverage for certain plans. Recent data shows that some employers have modified their benefits in response to federal parity requirements, with a small percentage dropping coverage for mental health services while others have eliminated limits on coverage or increased utilization management. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain services in specific financing arrangements. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. It amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements. MHPA establishes a small employer exemption, exempting employers with 2-50 employees from federal mental health parity requirements. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) established a small employer exemption for employers with 2-50 employees from federal mental health parity requirements. The MHPA was further amended by the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), which expanded the scope of parity requirements to include substance use disorders. MHPAEA also clarified and expanded on the cost exemption for group health plans experiencing a cost increase of at least 1% due to compliance with the act. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to specific plan types, mandating coverage of certain mental health services. Medicare plans are not required to comply with these requirements. The expansion raises questions about the reach of federal mental health parity law. The ACA expands federal mental health parity law to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Small employer exemption remains, but QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with parity requirements. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also comply with parity requirements. Considerations may need to be reconciled through rulemaking. The ACA expands federal mental health parity law to include qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. It mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The law requires that when mental health benefits are offered, they must be offered at full parity. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. Essential health benefits (EHB) are defined to include mental health and substance use disorder services. These services must be offered by QHPs at full parity. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for various health plans, requiring coverage within 10 broad categories. Medicaid benchmark plans and new plans in individual and small group markets must offer essential health benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014. While not a comprehensive federal mandate, these requirements create a federal-level obligation for insurers to cover mental health benefits. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for health plans, including through state parity laws. States can require additional benefits beyond EHB, but must cover the cost. QHPs offered through Exchanges must adhere to federal mental health parity requirements. QHPs offered through Exchanges must adhere to federal mental health parity requirements, impacting small group and individual plans. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate due to risk pooling benefits. Small employers are exempt from federal mental health parity laws, affecting plans offered through the Exchange. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market, but the small employer exemption may still apply. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply, with an expanded definition of \"small employer\" to include those with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees. States have the option to use the pre-ACA definition for plans offered through an Exchange until 2016, potentially leading to questions about compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals seeking coverage on the individual market. The federal mental health parity requirements may not apply to plans offered to single individuals seeking group coverage as employers. It is unclear if small employer QHPs may be exempt from these requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). Medicaid can be provided through traditional state plans or managed care plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, specifically for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Medicaid managed care plans must comply with these requirements for medical, surgical, mental health, and substance use disorder benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, specifically for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement, but Medicaid managed care plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for all benefits. It is unclear if non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid are required to comply with federal parity requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, specifically for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement, but Medicaid managed care plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for all benefits. It is unclear what effect requiring any type of Medicaid plan to adhere to federal mental health parity requirements, but then deeming those plans which offer EPSDT services as meeting these requirements, which they are required by law to do, will have on the actual terms of coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees. ACA Section 2001(a)(2)(A), in conjunction with ACA Section 2001(c), expands the requirement for compliance with certain federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations (up to or at 133% of federal poverty level), as added by the ACA, who would be enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute contains two provisions, enacted prior to the ACA, extending and applying the federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans. Although the ACA does not affect federal mental health parity requirements as they apply to CHIP plans, it appears that these two existing statutory provisions in SSA Title XXI may need to be conformed to reflect redesignations made by the ACA. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. Plans offering EPSDT services meet the parity requirement, but Medicaid managed care plans must comply with all federal mental health parity requirements. It is unclear how requiring Medicaid plans to adhere to parity requirements and deeming those offering EPSDT services as meeting them will impact coverage. The CHIP statute extends federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, which may need to be updated to reflect ACA changes. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, as well as CHIP plans. This extends coverage to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. Additionally, the ACA mandates coverage for specific mental health services, representing a significant change from federal law prior to the ACA. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to all qualified health plans, including Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, as well as CHIP plans. It represents a significant change from previous federal law."
