    "content": "SECTION 1. PROCEDURES FOR SEEKING COMPENSATION. Compensation procedures for wrongfully arrested individuals are established under Section 414 of title 39, United States Code. Individuals arrested by the Postal Inspection Service after December 31, 1983, in cases involving paid confidential informants for drug-related offenses may seek compensation through a petition. Compensation procedures for wrongfully arrested individuals are outlined in Section 414 of title 39, United States Code. Those arrested by the Postal Inspection Service post-December 31, 1983, for drug-related offenses involving paid informants can seek compensation through a petition. The petition must be filed within 2 years of exhausting all available administrative and judicial procedures. A panel of 3 qualified administrative law judges will review the petition. Compensation for wrongful arrest under Section 414 of title 39, United States Code includes provisions for reimbursement, award amounts, and payment from the Postal Service Fund based on the harm or injury suffered. A panel of administrative law judges will conduct proceedings and may award up to $500,000 in connection with any particular arrest. The Postal Inspection Service failed to prevent wrongful arrests, factors considered include harm suffered, past wrongful arrests, and compensation awarded. Determinations under this section are not subject to review. Definitions for Judicial Officer, controlled substance, and administrative law judge are provided. The Postal Inspection Service's failure to prevent wrongful arrests is addressed by defining when a confidential informant is considered \"paid\" for their services. This includes receiving monetary or nonmonetary benefits. The analysis for chapter 4 of title 39, United States Code, is amended accordingly. Compensation for wrongfully arrested individuals is addressed in section 414."
