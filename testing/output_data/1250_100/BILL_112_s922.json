    "content": "The Urban Jobs Act of 2011 may be cited as the ``Urban Jobs Act of 2011''. Congress finds that one-third of minority youth are unemployed, the labor force participation rate is lower for individuals without a high school diploma, African-American and Hispanic students have a lower graduation rate, high school dropouts cost the nation billions in lost wages, and only 52 percent of students in large cities graduate from high school. High school dropouts earn significantly less over their lifetime compared to graduates. Approximately 75 percent of State prison inmates and 59 percent of Federal prison inmates have not completed high school. Increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent for all men ages 20 to 60 would save the United States $1.4 billion annually in reduced costs associated with crime. A 10-percent increase in the male high school graduation rate would reduce arrest rates for murder and assault by about 20 percent, motor vehicle theft by 13 percent, and arson by 8 percent. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources to prevent disproportionate incarceration of eligible youth, especially minority youth, and prepare them for employment or education leading to economic self-sufficiency and advancement. The Act aims to prevent disproportionate incarceration of eligible youth, especially minority youth, and prepare them for employment or education leading to economic self-sufficiency and advancement through job training, education, and support services. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 includes a new section on Urban Jobs Programs (SEC. 173B) aimed at providing job training, education, and support services to eligible youth, particularly minority youth, to prevent disproportionate incarceration and promote economic self-sufficiency. The Urban Jobs Programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 aims to provide resources for establishing a feeder system for youth aged 18-24 in urban communities, offering employment or education leading to employment through national intermediaries. It also focuses on preparing eligible youth for employment through a comprehensive set of services and aims to prevent disproportionate incarceration of minority youth in urban areas. The term 'eligible youth' refers to individuals aged 18-24 who are not in school or have been involved in the criminal justice system. A 'national intermediary' is a nonprofit organization with a network in urban communities, expertise in working with youth, and a long history of operation. 'Recidivism' is defined as a tendency to reoffend, and an 'unsubsidized job' is employment without financial assistance. The Urban Jobs Program provides grants to national intermediaries for comprehensive services to eligible youth in urban communities, offering pathways to employment or education leading to employment. To qualify for a grant, a national intermediary must submit an application as specified by the Secretary. The Secretary may require a grant application to include a request for funding, proposed uses of funds, and goals for the Urban Jobs Program participants, such as increased employment, reduced recidivism, improved education attainment, and industry certifications.

The Urban Jobs Program grant offers various support services such as mentoring, internships, training, personal development, and job placement.
