    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The total cost of Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers would be $1.052 trillion. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, would cost $891 billion over 10 years for coverage provisions. The bill focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, providing financial assistance, and requiring individuals to maintain health insurance. The Affordable Health Care for America Act would require insurance or a payroll assessment, with market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue. Acceptable coverage would include plans under a qualified health benefits plan, offered through the Exchange or employer plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage the creation of non-profit health insurance cooperatives. It would not affect plans covering specific services like dental or vision care. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The report provides background information on the private insurance market and summarizes key provisions of H.R. 3962 affecting private health insurance. H.R. 3962, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, includes provisions impacting private health insurance. These provisions aim to change how current private health insurance markets operate, particularly for individuals buying coverage directly or through a small employer. Insurers would be required to cover individuals regardless of pre-existing conditions and not charge higher premiums based on health status. This is to address issues like adverse selection, where individuals may only enroll when sick, leading to higher premiums and more uninsured individuals. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 aim to address issues like adverse selection by requiring insurers to cover individuals regardless of preexisting conditions and not charge higher premiums based on health status. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) suggests that individuals must be required to purchase coverage to prevent only the sick from enrolling. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical, and premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies could result in individuals having health insurance they cannot afford to use. Removing one provision from the bill could hinder the implementation of others. The curr_chunk discusses individual and employer mandates for health insurance, private health insurance market reforms, and how Americans obtain health insurance through various methods. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured. Employers offer health insurance, with large employers enjoying lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. States have tried creating single sites for comparing insurance plans, but past experiments like California's PacAdvantage have failed. Although past experiments like California's PacAdvantage failed, other states have learned and created more sustainable models like Massachusetts' Connector. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance help individuals and small groups compare health insurance plans. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost, limited ability to spread risk, and disadvantages compared to larger firms. Small groups in the nongroup market may face challenges with health insurance, such as being medically underwritten and having limited bargaining power. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State and federal regulations impact the private health insurance market, with reforms affecting premium rates based on age, health, and behaviors. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires guaranteed issue coverage for small groups. In the small group market, policies for groups of 2-50 employees must be sold on a guaranteed issue basis, with all states requiring coverage acceptance. Some states also extend guaranteed issue policies to self-employed individuals and non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Premium rating rules vary by state, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating or rate bands. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in nongroup markets. In the small group market, adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range by the state. Federal law mandates limits on excluding coverage for preexisting conditions. Some states have stricter rules than federal standards. Some proponents advocate for a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of insurance market reform, citing potential cost savings and increased competition. Opponents raise concerns about unfair competition and the potential for driving private plans out of the market. The performance of health insurance organizations based on profit status is also being scrutinized. Non-profit health insurance organizations, including health insurance co-operatives, have shown better performance in terms of quality compared to for-profit organizations. Studies have indicated that non-profits score higher on quality measures. Advocates suggest incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives to improve competition and cost savings in the market. Advocates propose creating new health insurance co-operatives to invest earnings back into the plan for lower costs and innovative programs. Opponents argue co-operatives have not been successful nationwide and may not make insurance more affordable. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement health benefit reductions and allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational. The bill includes a temporary national high-risk pool program to provide health benefits until the Health Insurance Exchange is established. Health insurance issuers must provide a rebate if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level. Individuals up to age 26 can stay on their parents' plans, and the bill reduces the look-back period for pre-existing conditions from 6 months to 30 days. Premium increases must be justified to the Secretary and states before implementation. The bill prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition and mandates coverage for dependent children's congenital or developmental issues. It also prohibits lifetime benefit limits and establishes guidelines to prevent insurance policy rescission. Additionally, there is a mandate for individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. Individuals must have acceptable health insurance coverage, including a qualified health benefits plan, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, and coverage determined by the Secretary. Those without coverage may face an additional tax penalty based on income. Some individuals may receive subsidies to help with premiums and cost-sharing, while others may be exempt from the mandate. H.R. 3962 mandates employers to offer health insurance to employees or contribute to the Exchange, with exceptions for certain groups. Employers must provide coverage meeting essential benefits package requirements and contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan offered. Grandfathered plans have five years to comply with new regulations. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan offered and automatically enroll employees in the plan unless they opt out. They must provide written notice of employee rights and compliance information. The Secretary of HHS can terminate an employer's health insurance election if necessary. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 may face an excise tax if they do not offer health coverage. Employees can choose to enroll in a plan through the Exchange instead of the employer's coverage. Beginning in 2014, employers with higher wages would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. This payroll assessment does not apply to employees covered as dependents in an Exchange plan. Certain small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. The credit phases out as average employee compensation increases from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of employees increases from 10 to 25. Employees must receive at least $5,000 in compensation to be counted, but the credit does not apply to highly compensated employees with compensation exceeding $80,000. Adjustments for inflation will be made starting in the 2013 tax year. This credit is part of the general business credit and does not apply to insurance for highly compensated employees. The small business credit for tax year 2013 is part of the general business credit and is non-refundable. It is available only to businesses with tax liability, excluding non-profit organizations. H.R. 3962 establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing health conditions or health status. H.R. 3962 establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. Premiums must be determined using adjusted community rating rules, allowing variation based only on age and premium rating area. H.R. 3962 establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. Premiums must be determined using adjusted community rating rules, allowing variation based only on age categories specified by the Commissioner, premium rating area, and family enrollment. Non-discrimination standards, adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers, mental health parity rules, and coverage for qualified dependent children under 27 years of age are also mandated. Additionally, QHBPs must cover certain broad categories of benefits, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy standards. H.R. 3962 establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis. Premiums must be determined using adjusted community rating rules, with variation based on age categories, premium rating area, and family enrollment. The bill allows states to form Health Care Choice Compacts for the sale of individual health insurance plans across state lines. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance coverage in secondary states. QHBPs must cover the essential benefits package, including specified items and services, preventive services without cost-sharing, and comply with network adequacy standards. The package must be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. It includes hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, and rehabilitative services. The essential benefits package includes prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, maternity care, well baby and child care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit is $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families. Cost-sharing levels are determined by copayments, covering an average of 70% of health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange may have less cost-sharing or richer benefits. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, including cost-sharing levels and updates to the essential benefits package. The Committee would consider innovation in healthcare, reducing health disparities, and public input in its recommendations. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would provide access to insurers' plans in a comparable way to online travel booking platforms. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, headed by a Commissioner. It would oversee negotiations with plans, enforce requirements, determine eligibility for credits, and be funded by taxes, penalties, and assessments. Only one Exchange could operate in a state. The Commissioner would approve state-based Exchanges meeting criteria, funded through federal grants. New nongroup coverage after 2013 could only be obtained through the Exchange. CBO estimated 30 million people would have Exchange coverage by 2019. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employee, Medicare, or Medicaid. Open enrollment would occur annually for at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers could meet requirements by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment. Employers can become Exchange-eligible by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment. They can choose any available Exchange plans, with eligibility based on the number of employees. Plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. The entity must offer a Basic plan equivalent to the minimum requirements of the essential benefits package. They can also offer an Enhanced plan with lower cost-sharing and a Premium plan with even lower cost-sharing. Premium-Plus plans can be offered with additional benefits. Plans must adhere to specified cost-sharing levels but can vary by up to 10%. Under H.R. 3962, the Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange, offering Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus plans. Individuals eligible for Exchange insurance can enroll in the public option with income-based credits. The public option must meet Exchange plan requirements for benefits, provider networks, consumer protections, and cost-sharing. Geographically adjusted premiums would cover expected costs. The public option under H.R. 3962 would have limited start-up funding, to be repaid within 10 years. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare providers and services, with rates not lower than Medicare and not higher than other qualified entities. Physicians could participate as preferred or non-preferred providers, with restrictions on balance-billing. Non-physician providers would also be included. The public option under H.R. 3962 would allow balance-billing up to 115% of a reduced payment rate, with non-physician providers prohibited from balance-billing. The Secretary could use innovative payment methods and enter into no-risk contracts for administration. Enrollment in the public option would be facilitated through various administrative functions, including payment determination, beneficiary education, and provider consultative services. Additionally, a memorandum of understanding would be established with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for cost collection related to care provided in VA facilities. The bill allows individuals, including Members of Congress, to enroll in public health insurance through Exchange plans. They would be responsible for 100% of the premium. The bill also establishes a CO-OP program for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with $5 billion authorized for fiscal years 2010-2014. Grants and loans would be provided for start-up costs and solvency requirements. The cooperative must meet specific conditions to offer insurance through the Health Insurance Exchange or a state-based exchange. It must be a not-for-profit organization, not affiliated with an insurance company before July 16, 2009, and governed by ethical standards. The cooperative must be licensed in each state it operates, have governance by majority vote of members, and operate with a strong consumer focus. The cooperative operates with a strong consumer focus, using profits to improve healthcare quality. Grants and loans prioritize cooperatives with statewide operations, integrated delivery systems, or significant financial support. Violations of program terms require repayment of funds. Premium credits and subsidies may be available based on income to help with insurance costs and cost-sharing. Integration across state lines is permitted. Under H.R. 3962, eligible individuals can receive premium and cost-sharing credits in the Exchange if they meet certain criteria, including income levels below 400% of the federal poverty level and not being enrolled in certain other healthcare plans. Starting in 2015, individuals could choose Enhanced or Premium plans but would be responsible for additional premiums and not eligible for cost-sharing credits. The premium credit under H.R. 3962 is based on an \"affordable premium amount\" for individuals to pay, calculated as a percentage of income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner adjusts percentages to maintain government versus enrollee premium contributions. The credit is calculated against the reference premium, which is the three lowest-priced Basic plans in the area. The affordability premium credit is the lesser of how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable amount or how much the reference premium exceeds the affordable amount. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on family income tiers, with increasing limits on a sliding scale. Affordable premium credit would be calculated monthly, and assistance would be provided for cost-sharing. The Commissioner would specify reductions in cost-sharing amounts and annual out-of-pocket maximums under a Basic plan to align with actuarial values. Out-of-pocket limits in the table would be doubled for family coverage. The out-of-pocket limits in each tier would be increased in future years based on the percentage growth in premiums for Basic plans. The Commissioner would pay insurers additional amounts to cover the reduced cost-sharing provided to credit-eligible individuals. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Table 4 identifies these provisions and their estimated revenue over a 10-year period. Employer subsidy payments for prescription drug coverage to retirees meeting federal standards are also discussed. Employers providing retiree prescription drug coverage meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidy payments from the government. These subsidies are excluded from the employer's gross income for tax purposes. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the deduction by the amount of the federal subsidy received. This provision is estimated to raise $2.2 billion over 10 years. Additionally, tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending will be affected by the revenue provisions in H.R. 3962. Health FSAs and HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts that allow individuals to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. FSAs reimburse employees for health care expenses, while HSAs allow individuals to fund unreimbursed medical expenses. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs can be rolled over, unlike FSAs. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs and HSAs. It increases the penalty on non-qualified distributions from HSAs to 20% and limits FSA contributions to $2,500 per person. The bill also modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses, requiring prescriptions for over-the-counter medications. These changes are estimated to raise $6.3 billion over 10 years. H.R. 3962 would not preempt state laws on abortion coverage or procedural requirements. It prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or cover abortions. The bill also restricts the adoption of abortion-related standards for essential benefits packages. The Stupak Amendment, passed by a vote of 240-194, imposes additional restrictions on the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962. It prohibits the use of funds for abortions or coverage of abortion in health plans, except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the woman's life. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions. The Stupak Amendment imposes restrictions on the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962 for abortion coverage. It requires that supplemental coverage for abortions be paid for with non-H.R. 3962 funds and prohibits using premium payments with affordability credits. Nonfederal entities can offer separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be funded independently. Exchange plans are prohibited from discriminating against healthcare providers or facilities. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against healthcare providers or facilities for not providing, paying for, covering, or referring abortions. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws that meet certain requirements. The effectiveness of the law is determined by its impact on the medical liability system, disclosure of errors, and access to affordable insurance. The state law must include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and cannot limit attorneys' fees or impose damage caps. The bill would allow defendants to offer periodic payments for economic losses and legal fees within 180 days of a claim being filed. If the offer is declined and litigation proceeds, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. A certificate of merit program is required for medical malpractice suits. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws. The bill clarifies that it does not provide funds for incentive payments. The Act or amendments would not change state laws on medical malpractice cases. QHBPs must provide end-of-life planning information to enrollees and offer advance directives. QHBPs cannot promote suicide or hastening of death."
