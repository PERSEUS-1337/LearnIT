Evaluating government agencies and programs' performance is challenging due to disagreements on public fund usage, program goals, and success evaluation criteria. Evaluating government agencies and programs' performance is challenging due to disagreements on public fund usage, program goals, and success evaluation criteria. Different conceptions of \"good performance\" and difficulty in separating federal program influence from other factors make assessing success controversial and difficult. Some agencies and programs have inherently difficult-to-measure outcomes, with a time lag between actions and results. In the last 50 years, Congress and the President have made efforts to evaluate and manage the federal government's performance through initiatives like performance management, performance budgeting, and program evaluation. The Bush Administration introduced the PART ratings as part of the Budget and Performance Integration (BPI) initiative under the President's Management Agenda (PMA). The Budget and Performance Integration (BPI) initiative, part of the President's Management Agenda (PMA), aims to have Congress and the Executive Branch consider performance information in decision-making. The Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) evaluates program effectiveness by assessing purpose, design, planning, management, results, and accountability. The Bush Administration submitted around 400 PART scores for programs totaling 20% of the federal budget annually from FY2004 to FY2008. The Bush Administration released the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) to improve strategic planning and performance reporting, aiming to implement the objectives of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). However, there was controversy over the perceived lack of integration between PART and GPRA, with some observers criticizing OMB for substituting their judgment for stakeholder interests outlined in GPRA. Some recommended a stronger integration between PART and GPRA for better executive and congressional alignment. The Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was developed by OMB to integrate executive and congressional management reform efforts. OMB created different versions of the PART questionnaire for various programs, each consisting of approximately 30 questions divided into four sections. These sections are evaluated to determine a program's effectiveness rating, with weights assigned to program purpose and design, strategic planning, program management, and program results/accountability. OMB's program examiners and agency staff collaborate to complete the questionnaire and determine the program's PART scores. In cases of disagreement, a process similar to settling appeals on budget matters is followed to finalize scores. The PART process involves OMB political appointees and the White House finalizing scores for programs in the President's budget proposal to Congress. OMB's guidance defines programs from a budgetary perspective, often based on program activities listed in the budget proposal. The PART process allows flexibility for OMB and agencies to determine the unit of analysis for program review, using the formal budget structure. However, the budget structure may not always align with how programs are managed in practice. The budget structure serves as a transparent system for conveying PART results to interested parties. Program activities are defined by OMB's Circular No. A-11 and may not always align with an agency's organization or strategic planning. OMB provides a one-page \"Program Summary\" and a detailed PART \"worksheet\" for each assessed program. The numeric scores from each section of the questionnaire are used to generate an overall effectiveness rating for each program, ranging from Effective to Ineffective. OMB does not publish the single numerical scores but uses them to determine qualitative ratings that are comparable across programs. Composite weighted scores can be manually computed using OMB's weighting formula. The Government Accountability Office emphasizes interpreting \"Results Not Demonstrated\" as \"unknown effectiveness\" rather than \"ineffective.\" OMB's rating categories for the PART are based on overall quantitative scores, aiming for transparency and objectivity in the process. OMB worked with various stakeholders to improve the PART assessment process, including making detailed worksheets available, conducting consistency checks, and establishing formal criteria for assessing programs. Changes were made to increase transparency and objectivity, such as eliminating subjective questions. While subjectivity can be minimized, it cannot be completely eliminated. Subjectivity in completing the PART questionnaire and determining scores can be introduced by various sources, not just OMB career staff. Performance measurement in the public sector, like the PART, has limitations as it is only part of the information needed for decision-making. Performance information must be supplemented with evaluation data to understand program results and value. Performance measurement is essential to raise questions and assess programs, but it cannot replace data on program costs, political judgments, creativity, or common sense. The PART relies on objective data to evaluate programs, aiming to inform budget decisions without automatically determining funding.OMB's guidance emphasizes that decisions are based on program performance but also consider other factors. The PART assessments help link performance to budget decisions and provide a basis for making recommendations to improve results. The President's budget proposals for FY2004 and FY2005 were influenced by the PART process, with programs judged \"Effective\" receiving average increases of 7.18%. The Performance Institute noted a correlation between PART scores and funding changes, demonstrating a link between budget and performance in FY '05. The Performance Institute noted that the PART assessments influenced the President's budget proposals for FY2004 and FY2005, with \"Effective\" programs receiving average increases of 7.18%. The institute also highlighted the impact of the PART process on federal managers, performance management, outcome measures, and as a quality control tool for GPRA. Despite some criticism, including calling PART a blunt instrument, scholar Harry R. Hatry acknowledged the administration's effort to evaluate programs and emphasized the importance of examining program outcomes. Mr. Hatry emphasizes the importance of examining program outcomes and tying spending decisions to program effectiveness. He acknowledges the limitations of the PART process but supports adding information to the budget-making process. Scholars have analyzed PART using statistical techniques, finding a positive correlation between PART scores and the President's budget recommendations. The team found evidence that politics may have influenced budget recommendations and the use of the PART for FY2004, but not for FY2005. They also found that PART scores seemed to influence small and medium-sized programs, but not large programs. Observers consider the PART a form of performance budgeting, involving the use of performance information in the budget process. Scholars support using performance information but note a lack of consensus on its utilization. Practitioners acknowledge the usefulness of developing performance measures for management and decision-making. Budget officers rated the effectiveness of performance measures in effecting changes in resource allocation, programmatic changes, and communication patterns. However, few were enthusiastic about the impact on appropriation levels and cost savings. Implementation of performance measures improved communication between agency personnel, the budget office, and legislators. Performance budgeting is seen as having a disappointing past and an uncertain future. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) studied how the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) used the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) for the FY2004 budget. GAO found that the PART helped OMB structure and discipline performance information for program analysis and budget development. However, only 18% of the FY2004 PART recommendations directly impacted funding decisions. The PART's main role was in supporting recommendations to improve performance, rather than making resource decisions. The GAO criticized the PART for not being well integrated with GPRA, leading to OMB's influence on program goals and measures. Agency officials found the program-by-program focus and substitution of measures detrimental to their GPRA planning processes. OMB's guidance also required agencies to submit a performance budget for FY2005, replacing the annual GPRA performance plan. Despite PART's ability to stimulate discussion on program-specific performance issues, it lacks consultation with Congress as emphasized in GPRA. While PART can stimulate discussion on program-specific performance measurement issues, it is not a substitute for GPRA's strategic focus on thematic goals. GAO performed regression analysis on the Bush Administration's PART scores and funding recommendations, finding a positive relationship between PART scores and proposed budget changes for small discretionary programs. The GAO found that OMB's efforts to ensure consistency in assessing programs for the PART were not fully successful due to subjective terms in the questionnaire, disagreements on performance measures, lack of performance information, and mismatched program definitions. GAO recommended actions for OMB to address these issues, including monitoring agency implementation, improving PART guidance, and clarifying definitions. In response to GAO recommendations, OMB is working on improving the PART process by clarifying expectations for agencies, engaging in dialogue with congressional committees, and integrating GPRA with the PART for better performance assessment. OMB Deputy Director Clay Johnson III expressed commitment to enhancing the credibility and usefulness of the PART. GAO suggested a more systematic approach for Congress to articulate performance goals and outcomes for key programs. The GAO recommended that Congress establish a strategy for communicating performance goals and measures for key priorities, develop a structured oversight agenda for crosscutting programs, and use the agenda to inform authorization, oversight, and appropriations processes. This section discusses potential criteria for evaluating the PART or other program evaluations, which Congress may consider during the budget process, oversight of federal agencies, and legislation related to program evaluation. The criteria for evaluating program evaluations include validity, reliability, and objectivity. Validity measures if the instrument measures what it is intended to measure, reliability assesses consistency in measurements, and objectivity ensures unbiased conclusions. The evaluation of program effectiveness involves judging validity, reliability, and objectivity. These criteria are interrelated, as subjective application of measurement tools can lead to inconsistent or unreliable results. Further analysis is needed to identify any problems and determine their nature. The Administration has conducted assessments on program effectiveness, but determining validity, reliability, and objectivity in evaluating program effectiveness remains a challenge. To assess program effectiveness, it is important to consider validity, reliability, and objectivity. Different views exist on the effectiveness of OMB's PART instrument. GAO found that disagreements between OMB and agencies on performance measures raised concerns about the validity of the assessment tool. This raises questions about the goals and measures used to evaluate programs. Members of Congress and other stakeholders may have differing perspectives on program assessment. Under GPRA, stakeholder views are required to be solicited by statute, but the role and process for stakeholder participation under the PART are less certain. Issues identified by GAO relate to the PART instrument's validity, reliability, and objectivity in assessing program effectiveness. Objectivity issues include subjective questions in the PART assessment, such as determining if a program is \"excessively\" redundant or if its design is free of \"major flaws.\" The PART assessment raises questions about objectivity due to subjective terms used in evaluating program effectiveness, such as determining if a program is \"excessively\" redundant or if its design is free of \"major flaws.\"OMB acknowledges that subjectivity cannot be completely eliminated but aims to make the process transparent for discussion and debate."
