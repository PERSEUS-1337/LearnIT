Recognizing the value of outstanding teachers, the Act proposes a program where these educators can contribute their expertise to improve education programs. A successful pilot program has demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating exceptional teachers into professional staff roles in Congress. The \"Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act of 1994\" establishes a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, who will be known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". The Act defines terms such as \"contractor\" as a nonprofit educational organization administering the fellowship program, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy, \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"outstanding\" for math or science teachers with specific achievements. The term \"secondary school\" is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Teachers participating in the fellowship program must have received recognition and a sabbatical leave from teaching. The fellowship program is authorized for teachers who have received recognition and a sabbatical leave from teaching. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program authorizes the Secretary to provide 10 outstanding math or science teachers with fellowships each fiscal year. The number of fellowships awarded may be reduced based on available funding, with priority given to selected individuals. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program awards fellowships to outstanding math or science teachers for 10 months, coinciding with the academic year. The program includes fellowships in the Senate, House of Representatives, Department of Energy, Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and NASA. The Secretary can contract with a contractor for program administration. The contractor will administer the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program, including developing and managing the application process, screening applicants, and inviting teachers from various recognition programs to apply. The contractor will administer the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program, including final selection of recipients, orientation program development, reporting and evaluation program establishment, annual reporting to the Secretary, and fund administration. The contractor will use funds for fellowship recipient salaries, administrative expenses, relocation expenses, and final selection interviews. They may also seek non-Federal funding for travel and professional meeting expenses for recipients. The contractor will invite 20 semifinalists to Washington, D.C., for interviews after the initial screening process. Final selections for fellowship recipients will be made by designated officials from the House of Representatives and the Senate before May 1 each year. Each fellowship recipient selected by designated officials from the House of Representatives and the Senate will be placed within the department, agency, institute, or office of the selecting official. The final placement process involves interviews in various sections, offices, or divisions and must be completed before the start of the fellowship period. Fellowship recipients will be paid at a rate not exceeding GS-13 of the General Schedule. $550,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1995, with additional funds for 1996-2001."
