    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\". The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions, coordination for assessment and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, regular assessments, acquisition, reports on usage, funding, and additional authorities. Key terms like \"Administration,\" \"Administrator,\" and \"cooperative activities\" are defined within the Act. The \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions for key terms like \"data specifications,\" \"test or training range,\" and \"unmanned maritime systems.\" These terms refer to the type, resolution, periodicity, and quality of data required, designated areas for operating unmanned systems for evaluation or training, and systems used for evaluating performance or training personnel. The term \"unmanned maritime systems\" refers to remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including undersea and surface vehicles, as well as aerial vehicles used for maritime purposes. The CENOTE Act of 2018 also addresses coordination for assessment and acquisition of these systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administrator directs the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to coordinate research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems. This includes utilizing the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board for coordination and ensuring representation from the Office of Ocean Exploration. The Administrator coordinates with various offices, including the Office of Ocean Exploration and the Integrated Ocean Observing System, to actively engage with unmanned maritime systems. Efforts are made to align with the Navy, leveraging expertise and utilizing test ranges for unmanned systems. Interagency cooperation and sharing of best practices are prioritized. The Administrator formalizes coordination with the Secretary of the Navy to incorporate Administration priorities into Navy research and development activities, partner on unmanned maritime systems procurement, access Navy test ranges, and collaborate on mapping and ocean exploration. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate on advancing unmanned maritime systems development, testing, and integration for efficient manufacturing and acquisition. They may utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination and work with the academic sector for implementation. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with academic research institutions for research, training, commercialization, testing, and engagement related to unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator may coordinate with academic institutions and the private sector to support the commercialization and assessment of unmanned maritime systems. Regular assessments of these systems are conducted to support the missions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps regularly assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting Administration missions. The assessments focus on suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications and operational reliability. The Assistant Administrator and Director convene the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee and consult with other offices. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. A memorandum of agreement may be developed with the Secretary of the Navy to participate in procurements, accept decommissioned systems, share resources, and create efficiency in federal acquisition. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. A memorandum of agreement may be developed with the Secretary of the Navy to participate in procurements, accept decommissioned systems, share resources, and create efficiency in federal acquisition. Reports on unmanned maritime systems and their usage for the mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must be submitted to Congress every four years, detailing current systems, data benefits, data requirements, and available systems. The Administrator may utilize existing funds and additional authorities to carry out the Act, including entering into contracts with governments, accepting donations, and utilizing the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The appropriate committees of Congress are defined in the section, and funding for the Act will come from existing appropriations. The Administrator can utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program to accept funds, donations, and enter into contracts. They can also transfer funds to any organization and use resources from various government entities, subject to availability of appropriations. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
