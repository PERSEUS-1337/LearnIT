    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taxpayer Oversight of Surplus Property Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of the Federal Personal Property Utilization and Donation Program in allocating surplus property to various recipients, saving taxpayer dollars. Oversight by Members of Congress and officials is crucial to ensure fair distribution and be accountable to taxpayers. State agencies' efforts in distributing surplus property have benefited many American taxpayers. The current system for donating surplus Federal personal property is hindered by prioritizing foreign entities over the needs of American taxpayers. New legislation is needed to prioritize domestic transfers of excess property to Federal agencies over foreign assistance programs. The legislation aims to prioritize states and local organizations for receiving nonlethal excess supplies from the Department of Defense. Section 2547 of title 10, United States Code is amended to allow nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense to be provided to states or local governments before humanitarian relief purposes. The term 'State' includes states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. possession. Additionally, transfers of property for environmental protection in foreign countries are addressed in the legislation. SEC. 4 amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to allow property transfers for environmental protection in foreign countries. The Administrator of General Services must determine no Federal or State use requirements exist for the property. Confiscated property can be transferred to foreign countries. SEC. 5 requires a report on disposal and donation of surplus personal property. The Administrator of General Services must review statutes on surplus personal property disposal and donation within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A report to Congress should include the effectiveness of programs, property amounts, and legislative recommendations for integrating and consolidating programs under a single Federal authority."
