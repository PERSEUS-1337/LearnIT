    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Y2K State and Local GAP (Government Assistance Programs) Act of 1999\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act, known as the \"Y2K State and Local GAP Act of 1999,\" defines various welfare programs including TANF, Medicaid, food stamps, WIC, child support enforcement, and child welfare programs. Child welfare programs and child care are defined under specific parts of the Social Security Act. The term \"Y2K compliant\" refers to information technology accurately processing date and time data between the 20th and 21st centuries. Grants will be provided to states to ensure state and local government programs are Y2K compliant. The Secretary of Commerce will award grants to States for Y2K compliance in state and local government programs. Priority will be given to requests related to Federal welfare programs. Limitations include a maximum of 75 grants and only 2 grants per State. Applications must be submitted within 45 days of enactment through the State Governor's Office. The Secretary of Commerce will award grants to States for Y2K compliance in state and local government programs. Applications for the grants must include a proposed plan, budget, and funding source. States awarded a grant must match $1 for every $2 awarded to carry out the compliance program. The Secretary of Commerce may waive the matching requirement for States facing undue hardship. State expenditures for Y2K compliance can be in cash or in kind, but only expenses made after receiving the grant count towards the matching requirement. The Secretary of Commerce evaluates grant applications based on feasibility and achieving program goals. Grants are limited to a maximum of 2 years, with funds available until expended. States must submit annual reports on compliance program results, and a final report is due to Congress after all grants end. The Secretary of Commerce will submit a final report to Congress evaluating programs funded by grants. $40,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1999 to 2001 from Y2K Emergency Supplemental Funds."
