    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, it became independent from DOT to conduct unbiased investigations and recommend safety improvements. The NTSB determines accident causes, suggests safety enhancements, assists victims' families in disasters, and serves as an appeals board for transportation regulations. It lacks authority to enforce its recommendations or oversee safety practices. The NTSB consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with three-quarters located in Washington, DC. It also has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK, as well as a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from a regional office, impacting Hawaii. The NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii and regional staff in 25 states. The NTSB consists of a five-member board located in 25 states. Board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacement members are appointed. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode, with an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications coordinating actions in response to safety recommendations. The NTSB also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. The NTSB investigates various transportation accidents and safety issues, including civil aircraft accidents, railroad accidents, pipeline accidents, and major marine casualties. The office coordinates communications with Congress, transportation stakeholders, and the public regarding Board actions and safety advocacy. The NTSB relies on experts from various fields and external entities to assist in investigations through the \"party process.\" Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings. Interested parties can provide technical expertise but final conclusions are based on NTSB staff analysis. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings. The NTSB relies on experts and external entities through the \"party process\" for investigations. Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on findings. Board members must meet in public on most matters, provide financial disclosures, and avoid certain financial interests. Despite safeguards, the potential for outside influence still exists, which could impact the agency's credibility. Balancing parties' unique data and technical expertise with preventing influence is a challenge. Competing perspectives in complex investigations can prolong the process. The NTSB participates in foreign aviation accident investigations as per international treaties and ICAO standards. They may assist other countries even without a vested interest, and may be reimbursed for costs. Legislative changes allow for offsetting collections from such reimbursements. The NTSB recovers costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through the Safe Skies for Africa program. They issue safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with a high rate of implementation. The NTSB issues safety recommendations for transportation improvements, which agencies must respond to within 90 days. While not mandatory, most recommendations are eventually implemented, although delays can occur due to various factors. The NTSB focuses on safety improvements and does not consider cost-benefit analysis in its recommendations. They highlight key safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list. The NTSB issues key safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list for transportation improvements, influencing regulatory agenda and congressional decision-making. These recommendations cover various safety measures across different modes of transportation. The NTSB's influence is evident in legislation requiring safety measures in transportation, such as positive train control systems, regulations for airline pilot fatigue, laws on distracted driving, and improved safety standards for pipelines. For instance, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 incorporates NTSB recommendations for airline pilot training and monitoring automated systems. The FAA will assess recommendations from the Pilot Fitness Aviation Rulemaking Committee on mental health screening for pilots. This follows international aviation safety concerns after incidents like the Germanwings crash in 2015. Additionally, Section 2105 mandates the evaluation and updating of standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors and requiring automatic shutoff valves. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 aimed to enhance pipeline safety by increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying maximum allowable operating pressure, increasing civil penalties, and reviewing diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, reducing incidents due to speed, conflicting movements, and failure to obey signals. The NTSB also prioritizes actions to minimize operator errors for safety improvements. The NTSB prioritizes safety improvements by minimizing operator distractions that cause transportation accidents. A distracted driving incentive grant program was established in 2012 to discourage texting and cell-phone use while driving. Only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015, but a provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. Funding for the NTSB typically consists of a base authorization or appropriation. Funding for the NTSB includes a base authorization, emergency fund for accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for complex investigations. The emergency fund is maintained at $2 million with authorization to increase to $4 million. The NTSB has not used the emergency fund or sought supplemental appropriations in over a decade. The GAO evaluates NTSB operations and activities. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and fully implemented recommendations. GAO found improvements in NTSB management but highlighted the need for further enhancements in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. Current issues include staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, and safety issues related to vehicle recorders in accidents. The NTSB has addressed GAO findings and implemented recommendations, focusing on management improvements. Current challenges include staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, and safety issues with vehicle recorders in accidents. The NTSB has requested increased funding for staffing to carry out its mission effectively, with a strategic human capital plan in place to address critical competencies and workforce diversity. Limited resources have led to extended accident investigations and the inability to investigate some pipeline and railroad accidents. The NTSB faces challenges with staffing resources, including potential shortages in critical fields like railroad and pipeline accident investigation. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to address the high number of fatal accidents. The NTSB has concerns about staffing shortages due to retirements and skill gaps, particularly in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB has authority to investigate accidents but may struggle to meet statutory requirements due to staffing challenges. The Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000 granted the NTSB authority to partner with facilities for accident investigation training. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University was completed in 2003 but has struggled to achieve financial self-sufficiency. The center trains NTSB staff and industry personnel for accident investigations and safety meetings, but revenues have not covered costs. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University has faced financial challenges despite hosting safety-related meetings and training. The NTSB has relied on leases and rentals to cover costs, but a 2006 GAO study raised concerns about revenue generation. The NTSB was found in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act due to lease negotiations. Possible remedies include renegotiating the lease or vacating the space. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University has financial challenges despite hosting safety-related meetings and training. GAO suggested vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy, but potential benefits were not fully considered. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh costs and benefits, as past legislation did not address management practices. The NTSB has improved utilization of the training center, increasing classroom usage and leasing unutilized space. Operating deficit has decreased, but the facility still does not recoup all costs. Congress may need to make changes before the lease agreement expires. The NTSB faces financial challenges at the Training Center, with Congress needing to consider changes before the lease agreement expires. Data recorders are crucial for aviation investigations, but challenges exist in recovering them promptly and concerns about privacy. Recent accidents like Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804 highlight the difficulties in retrieving recorders, with Malaysia Airlines flight 370 still missing. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations urging for aircraft to transmit data on impact location and carry recorders for easier recovery. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology for timely data retrieval. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aims to improve the recovery of flight data recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 highlighted concerns over locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders. Under SOLAS regulations, certain vessels must carry voyage data recorders, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. New regulations require new ships to have both types of recorders with enhanced data capture capabilities. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding the recovery or survivability characteristics of maritime voyage data recorders, but concerns over data recovery may prompt congressional interest in assisting investigators. Event recorders are aiding accident investigations in various transportation modes, raising privacy concerns about the use of collected data outside investigative proceedings. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 aims to restrict access to data recorded by event data recorders in passenger vehicles. The bill requires lessee's consent for vehicle diagnostics, service, or repair purposes. It also mandates a study on event data recorders for investigating motor vehicle crashes. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations has been prompted by recent derailments. The NTSB lacks resources for investigating all required railroad accidents. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 authorizes appropriations to the NTSB for railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. It also directs a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
