    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2011\". The findings are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that breast cancer accounts for a significant portion of cancer diagnoses among women, with higher survival rates for White women compared to African-American women. African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed at later stages despite a lower incidence rate. Early detection significantly improves survival rates, with a 98 percent 5-year survival rate for early-stage breast cancers. Triple-negative breast cancer, affecting 10-20 percent of female patients, lacks certain receptors and proteins. Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer that affects women under 50 across all racial backgrounds. African-American women are 3 times more likely to develop this type of cancer compared to White women. Early detection is crucial for survival as hormone therapy and drugs targeting receptors are ineffective against these cancers. Current research lacks adequate information on the prevalence, costs, and prevention methods of triple-negative breast cancer in minority women. Early detection and education are crucial for combating this aggressive form of cancer. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand research programs for triple-negative breast cancer. The research will be coordinated through various institutes and centers, with a focus on minority health disparities. $500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2015 for this purpose. Education and dissemination of information regarding triple-negative breast cancer will be emphasized as part of the research programs funded by $500,000 annually from 2013 to 2015. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share public information on triple-negative breast cancer, focusing on incidence, risk for minority women, and treatment options. Information may be disseminated through various channels, and funding is authorized for fiscal years 2013 to 2015. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide information on triple-negative breast cancer to healthcare providers, emphasizing the elevated risk for minority women and treatment options. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2013 to 2017."
