    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that large truck crashes are more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, there were 5,212 deaths and 114,000 injuries from large truck-related crashes, totaling 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes not only result in human loss but also impose a significant economic cost on society. The Department of Transportation estimates that highway crashes cost society $230.6 billion a year. Investments in advanced safety technologies by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to mitigate commercial motor vehicle crash scenarios. The goal is to reduce the traffic fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million vehicle miles traveled by 2011. Accelerated deployment of these technologies can help achieve this critical goal. Congress aims to increase the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to reduce injuries and fatalities on the nation's roads and highways, mitigating the societal cost of crashes.

The curr_chunk discusses various safety systems in vehicles, including lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems. These systems alert drivers of potential dangers on the road through audio, visual, or tactile notifications. Active interventions are also mentioned, such as automatically reducing the risk of rollover or directional instability. Active interventions in vehicles involve automatically reducing vehicle speed or applying brakes to align the vehicle to the correct path of travel. Controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer, including foreign corporations.
