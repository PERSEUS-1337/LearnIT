    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security for the 21st Century Act\" establishes Retirement Security Accounts under Title II of the Social Security Act. This includes Part A for Insurance Benefits and Part B for Retirement Security Accounts with defined definitions. The Act establishes Retirement Security Accounts under Title II of the Social Security Act, defining key terms such as Commissioner, electing individual, eligible individual, retirement security account, and retirement security account contribution. The Retirement Security Accounts are established under Title II of the Social Security Act, with key terms defined including 'retirement security account contribution' as per section 252(e)(2)(A). The Retirement Security Accounts are established under Title II of the Social Security Act for the election and establishment of retirement security accounts. Sec. 252 of the Social Security Act allows eligible individuals to elect to make retirement security account contributions, which are irrevocable once made. The election can be done through W-4 forms or other methods prescribed by the Commissioner. Within 30 days of receiving the first contribution, a retirement security account is established in the individual's name. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers retirement security account contributions from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund to an individual's retirement security account. The contribution amount is based on a percentage of wages or self-employment income collected under the Internal Revenue Code. The applicable percentage for quarters of coverage during an election period is determined based on amounts collected under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The percentage increases for successive quarters but is capped at a certain point. Electing individuals must designate investment options for their retirement security account. The retirement security account contributions are to be credited to an account designated by the individual. The designation must be made as prescribed by the Commissioner to ensure ease of administration. If no designation is made, the Commissioner will assign an investment option according to regulations. Treatment of retirement security accounts: Any retirement security account will be treated the same as an individual account in the Thrift Savings Fund. Distributions from retirement security accounts are also addressed. Sec. 254 states that distributions from a retirement security account can only be made once the individual starts receiving benefits. At least 75 percent of the account balance must be paid out through annuities or monthly payments based on the individual's life expectancy. Regulations will outline the specifics of these distributions. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board determines excess funds distribution in retirement accounts. In case of death before distribution, the balance is paid to heirs. All distributions are tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board manages excess funds distribution in retirement accounts, with tax-exempt distributions to heirs in case of death before distribution. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board oversees the Retirement Security Fund, similar to the Thrift Savings Fund, managing and reporting on retirement accounts. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board conducts a study on increasing investment options for individual retirement accounts and submits a report with recommendations to the President and Congress within 2 years of the Social Security for the 21st Century Act enactment. The Retirement Security Fund Investment Board submits recommendations for legislative actions to the President and Congress within 2 years of the Social Security for the 21st Century Act enactment. The Retirement Security Fund and its accounts are excluded from the US Government budget totals and limitations. Amendments apply to elections after December 31, 2000. Social Security benefits are adjusted for electing individuals under Part B. The primary insurance amount for an electing individual under Part B is reduced by 50 percent, effective for benefits received after December 31, 2000. This reduction does not affect the benefits of dependents. SEC. 3 amends the Social Security Act to include an estimate of retirement security account contributions and balances in benefit statements. SEC. 4 establishes a special reserve account. A special reserve account called the 'Protect Social Security Account' is established within the Treasury to save budget surpluses until a reform measure is enacted to ensure the long-term solvency of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay into the account an amount equal to 70 percent of the projected surplus in the total budget of the United States Government for a specified fiscal-year period. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest budget surplus funds in the 'Protect Social Security Account' until a reform measure is enacted. Public-debt obligations may be issued for purchase for the account, with interest and proceeds credited to the account. The term 'total budget of the United States Government' includes all spending and receipt accounts. The amendment applies to fiscal years starting on or after October 1, 1999."
