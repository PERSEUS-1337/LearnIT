    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities, including children living with relatives due to parental inability. Additionally, many children with disabilities are in foster care. Approximately 165,000 children with disabilities live with foster care parents in the United States. Nearly 4,000,000 individuals of all ages with mental retardation or developmental disabilities reside with their families. Around 25 percent of the nation's elderly have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs. Additionally, 42 percent of individuals in the U.S. needing daily living assistance are under 65 years old, and there are insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women, facing emotional, physical, and financial hardships. They lack information on available respite care, which is insufficient and mainly targeted at lower-income individuals. If family caregivers were replaced with paid services, it would cost around $200 billion annually. The text highlights the challenges faced by women as family caregivers, including a lack of information on available respite care programs. These programs are insufficient and primarily cater to lower-income individuals, leaving many caregivers without adequate support. The limited number of respite care programs also struggle to recruit trained workers. The purpose of the title is to encourage the establishment of state and local respite care programs, improve information dissemination to caregivers, and enhance respite care services. The text emphasizes the need for lifespan respite care programs to improve information dissemination, enhance services, support research on effective care, and promote innovative approaches. The text highlights the importance of evaluative research to identify effective respite care services and promote the dissemination of results and findings related to respite care delivery and caregiver training programs. \"SEC. 2802.
