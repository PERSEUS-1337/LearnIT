    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\". The Congress finds that the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia resulted in over 230,000 deaths. There is a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major seismic event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone on the west coast of the United States in the next 50 years, which could cause significant damage. Many coastal communities are not prepared for such an event. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program supports departments lacking resources for tsunami preparedness and response, aiming to improve warning systems for coastal communities and overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis, prioritizing those with a 10% or greater likelihood within 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency services providers. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for residents. The grant funds can be used for hospitals, shelters, and sewer sanitation systems, as well as post-tsunami shelters, supplies, and outreach programs for residents and tourists. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. Emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes must provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for grants under this Act. The percentages vary based on population size: over 50,000 (20%), between 20,001 and 50,000 (10%), and under 20,000 (5%). To qualify for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments in areas with a population under 20,000 must contribute 5% of the project cost with non-Federal funds. The Secretary can consider in-kind contributions, not exceeding 50% of the department's non-Federal funds, when determining the total project costs. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if emergency management departments that received grants under this Act meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation.\n\nSEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" pertains to an agency responsible for planning, preparing, and managing emergencies or disasters within a community. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various territories. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $100,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2007-2012 for Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program. Director may reserve 5% for administrative costs.
