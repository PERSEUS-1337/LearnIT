    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts fund federal highway and mass transit programs, safety, research, and some rail programs. The most recent authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009, leading to a series of extension acts and resolutions due to budget constraints. The highway trust fund, supported by gasoline and diesel taxes, has seen declining revenues in recent years. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has faced revenue declines due to economic conditions and improved fuel efficiency, leading to debates on passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising gas taxes, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues like alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management are also being discussed. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved given current revenue forecasts. The distribution of federal spending among states is a challenge due to revenue forecasts. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. H.R. 7, a five-year bill, was reported favorably by House committees for infrastructure and energy projects. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, a five-year bill authorizing $260 billion. The bill includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing mass transit funding from HTF revenues. H.R. 7 differs from MAP-21 in programmatic content and treatment of the HTF, both reducing programs by two-thirds and free of earmarks. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) on April 18, 2012, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The bill included provisions related to the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273), and environmental streamlining provisions of Title III of H.R. 7. The Senate later replaced the House-passed language with MAP-21, leading to the measure being sent to conference. The House passed H.R. 4348, extending surface transportation authorizations. The Senate substituted MAP-21 language, sending the measure to conference. Negotiations will involve H.R. 7 provisions. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex, involving multiple committees. The highway trust fund is financed by various taxes. The highway trust fund is financed by various taxes, with the majority of revenue coming from excise taxes on motor fuels. The fund consists of two separate accounts for highway and mass transit, with fuel tax rates last raised in 1993 and not adjusted for inflation. The fuel taxes, set in cents per gallon since 1993, do not increase with inflation, leading to a shortfall in revenues. The Highway account has required transfers from the general fund to pay states for completed work. The Congressional Budget Office projects a $4.6 billion shortfall by the end of FY2013. The Highway account is projected to have a $4.6 billion shortfall by the end of FY2013, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is expected to fall into a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014, deepening further in the following years. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund system will struggle to support transportation spending. The Highway Program, funded by fuel taxes, faces challenges in supporting transportation spending without an increase in revenue. State DOTs manage the program but must adhere to federal guidelines. Policymakers must find new revenue sources or accept a smaller program. The Highway Program is primarily state-run, with state DOTs determining spending and complying with federal guidelines. Projects require a state/local matching share, typically 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. FHWA manages fund distribution through notifications and apportionment among states. States do not receive federal money upfront for highway projects. FHWA notifies states of federal fund availability for highway projects, with apportionment and allocation of funds. Reimbursement is provided after project approval and costs are incurred to prevent waste. Contract authority allows for obligation without appropriation, committing the federal government to reimburse states. The FHWA provides contract authority for highway projects, legally committing the federal government to reimburse states for the federal share of a project. Oblimit controls annual spending, setting a limit on contract authority that can be obligated in a fiscal year. Formula programs allocate funds annually among states based on specific factors, while discretionary programs are separate. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway funds are apportioned to state DOTs through core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ, HSIP, and EB. Formula programs allocate funds based on specific factors, while discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress. The authorization act sets the total amount authorized for each core program, and each program's formula determines each state's portion of the program total. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP, reducing the importance of funding formulas and program distinctions. Highway Program funding may also be used for transit projects. State DOTs have increasing flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP. Some Highway Program funding can be used for transit projects, reducing the significance of funding formulas and program eligibility distinctions. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum share of funds, regardless of formulas, aiming for each state to receive at least 92% of its highway users' tax payments. This program is seen as diluting the core program formulas' policy rationales. Additionally, smaller discretionary highway programs, known as \"allocated\" programs, are part of the Federal-Aid Highway. The Equity Bonus Program aims to ensure each state receives a minimum share of funds from users' tax payments to the highway account of the HTF, regardless of formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs, referred to as \"allocated\" programs, are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, with some funds earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. The term \"program\" is broadly used, encompassing various activities under FHWA's control, including specific project designations, pilot programs, and studies. The federal transit program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. The Urbanized Area Formula Program, which makes up 41% of authorized transit funding, provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more for various expenses including capital and planning. The Urbanized Area Formula Program in SAFETEA provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more for various expenses including capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations. Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds mainly go towards the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. New Starts Program and Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Program are discretionary programs for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. In SAFETEA, 18% of transit funding is available for new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including busways, ferries, and automated guideway systems. A \"Small Starts\" program was enacted to fund projects costing $250 million or less, with $75 million or less in federal share. Bus Program funds, 9% of authorized funding, are used for buses, equipment, and facilities. The Federal Transit Administration allocates funds for purchasing buses, bus-related equipment, and building facilities. Other smaller funding programs account for 15% of transit program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the US, with states primarily responsible for highway safety. Highway safety in the United States is primarily the responsibility of states, with Congress establishing federal highway safety programs to assist in improving safety. Three DOT agencies administer these programs, focusing on driver behavior, vehicle safety, commercial driver qualifications, commercial vehicle safety, and roadway design. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and conducts research on traffic safety. The Highway Safety Improvement Program, overseen by NHTSA, provides grants to states for roadway safety efforts. States must submit approved safety plans to receive federal funds, identifying safety problems, setting goals, and establishing performance measures. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance through various grant programs. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety programs, including data collection, speeding reduction, seat belt usage, drunk driving prevention, and more. FMCSA ensures commercial vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, and grant programs for truck and motor coach operations. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and grant programs. It administers motor carrier safety grant programs to ensure truck and motor coach operations' safety. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving road design or operation. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. HSIP includes a set-aside for the Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program and funds for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads. SAFETEA extended mechanisms to guarantee annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects, protecting funds from being used elsewhere. Appropriators honored the budget firewalls set in the Budget Enforcement Act until 2002. The SAFETEA Act extended guarantees for annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects, preventing funds from being redirected. Appropriators adhered to these guarantees until 2002. The House rules provided a second layer of protection, but this was eliminated in the 112th Congress, removing the last safeguard. The RABA mechanism allowed for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway account receipts, potentially leading to either increased funding or cuts. Congress has never allowed a negative RABA calculation to occur. The RABA mechanism allows for adjustments to funding levels based on annual highway account receipts, potentially leading to increased funding or cuts. Despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels in recent years, funding reductions have been avoided due to general fund transfers. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to agree on spending reductions. Consideration of a mechanism to align spending with receipts may still be on the table for reauthorization. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to agree on spending reductions. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act likely mean that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways and Highway Traffic Safety Grants. Surface transportation programs and activities exempted from sequestration include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety Operations and Grants, and Transit Formula and Bus Grants. The $739 million annual contract authority exempt from obligation limitations may be subject to sequester. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program supported by general fund revenues is also at risk. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for the HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization for the HTF and federal surface transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The Senate agreed to substitute the full text of MAP-21, leading to negotiations involving H.R. 7. Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica has stated that negotiations on the House extension legislation, MAP-21 and STEA-II, will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7. Provisions in conference proposals must align with the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Members may question what is within the allowable scope for conference on H.R. 4348, as provisions from H.R. 7 not in either version may be proposed. Conference reports with out-of-scope provisions could face points of order in both chambers, but rules allow for waivers. In the House and Senate, rules allow for waivers on points of order regarding conference reports. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act. This act transfers permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline and requires a permit to be issued within 30 days. Title II of the bill transfers permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, requiring a permit to be issued within 30 days. It also establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund funded by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The Trust Fund, financed by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident, will distribute revenues to Gulf Coast states, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and research. H.R. 4348 requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike S. 1400. The total budgetary resources for a fiscal year must equal the receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, with restrictions on use for harbor maintenance programs. The provision in Title V of the bill would restrict the use of budgetary resources to harbor maintenance programs. Title V also includes the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act. Title VI, which is the text of Title III of H.R. 7, aims to expedite transportation project delivery and reduce highway programs. Both House and Senate bills focus on programmatic reauthorization and regulatory changes, without earmarks. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill funding the Federal-Aid Highway Program at baseline levels. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that aims to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs. It eliminates formula factors and allocates funding based on state apportionments from FY2005-FY2009. The bill authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012, $40.5 billion for FY2013, and $400 million for research and education each fiscal year. The MAP-21 bill replaces individual program formulas with a calculation based on state apportionments from FY2005-FY2009. This change reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection, shifting towards federal planning and performance management. MAP-21 eliminates program formulas and congressional earmarking, shifting towards federal planning and performance management. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of apportionment. The number of programs is reduced by two-thirds, with eligibility shifted to core programs. Discretionary grant programs under FHWA control are mostly eliminated, including the Transportation Enhancements Program. States can use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses starting in FY2013 if they maintain an unspent balance for one and a half years. The Transportation Enhancements Program (TE) is merged into the CMAQ program, allowing states to use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after FY2013. The bill also introduces a National Freight Program (NFP) to increase funding for freight projects and significantly boosts funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. However, the bill does not address tolling of federally funded roads and bridges. H.R. 7 is a five-year reauthorization bill with increased funding for various transportation programs. The House bill for transportation reauthorization includes modest increases in funding for federal-aid highways and research/education. It consolidates programs, reduces the number of distinct programs by two-thirds, and introduces an Equity Bonus program. The bill does not address tolling of federally funded roads and bridges. The House bill for transportation reauthorization consolidates programs, reduces the number of distinct programs by two-thirds, and introduces an Equity Bonus program. The Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for mass transit and highway programs. Provisions under the streamlining title would change requirements in the National Environmental Policy Act for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA would no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total project costs. The House bill for transportation reauthorization consolidates programs, reduces the number of distinct programs by two-thirds, and introduces an Equity Bonus program. NEPA requirements would change for federal highway and transit projects, with NEPA no longer applying to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total project costs. Funding for transit programs under MAP-21 would be $10.458 billion annually for FY2012-FY2013, with the creation of the State of Good Repair program and elimination of the Bus and Bus Facilities program. The House bill for transportation reauthorization would replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program and eliminate the Bus and Bus Facilities program. A new program called the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would provide competitive grants for bus upkeep. Funding of $75 million would be set aside from the New Starts program. The bill would authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. It includes renaming the Mass Transit Account as the Alternative Transportation Account and redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account. The ATA would be funded by transferring $40 billion from the general fund and eliminating certain grant programs. The House bill for transportation reauthorization would rename the Mass Transit Account as the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redirect motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account. The ATA would be funded by transferring $40 billion from the general fund. It eliminates various grant programs and combines others into a single program. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control for both passenger and freight rail. Amendments to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program (RRIF) are also included. The House bill for transportation reauthorization includes provisions for the development of a rolling stock equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services and positive train control. It also amends the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program (RRIF) for freight rail, allowing state or local subsidies as collateral. The bill makes changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The finance title aims to close the gap between projected revenues and total authorizations. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes and trust fund expenditure authority. The Senate bill's finance title aims to bridge the gap between projected HTF revenues and total authorizations by extending highway-related taxes through FY2015 and trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013. It includes provisions to raise $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the HTF, with transfers from various sources such as the LUST trust fund balance, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports of tax delinquents, and allowing the Treasury to levy up to 100% of Medicare payments. The Senate bill's finance title aims to raise $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through various sources such as the Gas Guzzler Tax transfer, revocation of passports of tax delinquents, and allowing the Treasury to levy up to 100% of Medicare payments. Other revenue sources include future import tariffs on automotive products, tax treatment changes for controlled corporations, IRS levy on federal employee's Thrift Savings Account, pension asset transfers, and application of U.S. tax code Section 420 to life insurance benefits. The Senate bill aims to raise $13.872 billion for the Highway Trust Fund through various sources, including levying federal employee's Thrift Savings Account for tax liabilities, pension funding stabilization, transfers from the Treasury general fund, phased retirement offerings by federal agencies, and extending taxes on cigarette manufacturers. The Senate bill includes various revenue provisions to raise funds for the Highway Trust Fund, such as phased retirement offerings by federal agencies, extending taxes on cigarette manufacturers, and other measures totaling more than needed for offsetting spending levels. This surplus could be used for deficit reduction or additional spending. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception for bonds, tax preferences for bonds issued before 2013, employer-provided benefits, and the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate bill includes provisions such as authorizing states to issue TRIP bonds for infrastructure projects and changing the depreciation period for long-term highway leases. This may impact the attractiveness of highway privatization to private-sector investors. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend the depreciation period for long-term highway leases from 15 to 45 years, potentially reducing the appeal of highway privatization to private investors. It also addresses concerns about the amortization period for franchise rights to collect tolls being shorter than the lease term. The Joint Committee on Taxation includes a placeholder for the RESTORE Act in the revenue provisions for MAP-21. The finance provision in the bill establishes a \"solvency account\" for the Highway Trust Fund, ensuring a financial cushion of $2.8 billion for both the highway and mass transit accounts. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund, addressing groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund to provide new revenue for the highway trust fund, addressing groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The LUST trust fund receives revenues from a 0.1 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuels, supporting environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs. States historically used the fund for overseeing corrective actions by responsible parties and conducting cleanup in emergencies. The LUST trust fund is used to oversee and enforce corrective actions by responsible parties, conduct cleanup in emergencies, and address releases from leaking petroleum tanks. The fund had a balance of $3.392 billion in FY2012, with an estimated $117 million in interest payments and $181 million in tax revenue expected. In FY2012, the LUST trust fund had a balance of $3.392 billion. Congress typically appropriates around $113 million annually from the fund, with states receiving 80% of the allocation as grants. States' LUST programs have relied on nonfederal funds due to low appropriations. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Additionally, future LUST trust fund receipts from the gasoline and diesel fuel tax would be appropriated to the highway trust fund, providing an estimated $3.685 billion over ten years. The bill also extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013. The authority to extend the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) expenditure is set to expire on March 31, 2012. The Senate bill proposes extending it through September 30, 2013. H.R. 7 includes provisions to reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes through FY2018. The bill also requires future transfers from the general fund to the HTF to be fully offset. The finance provisions of H.R. 7 reconfigure the Highway Trust Fund by filling two gaps with revenue increases or offsets. One is the difference between highway account revenues and balances, and the other is $40 billion of general fund resources for the proposed alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund; instead, it extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016. Originally, H.R. 7 aimed to direct federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. H.R. 7 aimed to direct federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund until October 1, 2016. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions as separate bills, which would be incorporated into H.R. 7 if it passed. The statutory basis for offshore energy development is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, administered by the Department of the Interior. This program allows leasing for oil and gas resources in federal ocean areas in exchange for payments and royalties. The Department of the Interior leases rights for oil and gas development in federal ocean areas, generating $6.5 billion in federal receipts in FY2011. Current law allocates these receipts to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. Gulf Coast states receive additional funds from specified leases. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account of the HTF to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. It transfers 2.86 cents per gallon of motor fuels taxes to the highway account. Title XVI, Federal Employee Retirement, is included to provide offsetting revenues for the $40 billion in general fund revenues provided to the alternative transportation account over the life of the bill. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, with $39.9 billion for FY2012 and $40.9 billion for FY2013. The bill eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA, with a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. It does not include highway program earmarks and includes a provision for highway spending controls to ensure the solvency of the highway account of the HTF. The \"ratchet mechanism\" in Section 4001 of MAP-21 aims to maintain the solvency of the highway account of the HTF by reducing the FY2012 ObLim if the balance falls below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013. This adjustment would be reflected in the distribution to states, with withdrawn ObLim lapsing and contract authority rescinded proportionately. The provision is only applicable to year-long appropriations bills, not short-term continuing resolutions, and is related to the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21. The ratchet mechanism in Section 4001 of MAP-21 aims to maintain the solvency of the highway account of the HTF by reducing the FY2012 ObLim if the balance falls below certain thresholds. This provision is only applicable to year-long appropriations bills and may increase pressure to identify additional revenue options for the HTF. Congress may face resistance in implementing the mechanism due to past negative RABA calculations. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with obligation limitations set for FY2013-FY2016. Some highway programs would be funded from an Alternative Transportation Account, providing an additional $2.7 billion annually. The bill does not include spending guarantee mechanisms like SAFETEA. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with obligation limitations set for FY2013-FY2016. It includes an Alternative Transportation Account providing an additional $2.7 billion annually, funding various highway programs such as CMAQ and Ferry Boats. The bill also allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with obligation limitations set for FY2013-FY2016. It includes funding for programs like CMAQ, Ferry Boats, and Puerto Rico Highways. The bill also allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system, with restrictions on adding toll lanes while maintaining the same number of free lanes. Unlike previous acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology based on each state's initial amount and adjustments to ensure a minimum level of funding. Adjustments may not be necessary due to federal highway spending exceeding revenues for FY2005-FY2009. The MAP-21 legislation determines state apportionments for major programs based on each state's initial amount and adjustments to ensure minimum funding levels. Adjustments may not be needed due to federal highway spending exceeding revenues for FY2005-FY2009. 95% of estimated tax payments from highway users go to the highway account of the HTF, with additional amounts set aside for the new CMAQ program and metropolitan planning. The state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009 is calculated based on the initial amount and adjustments for core programs like NHPP, TMP, HSIP, and NFP. Further adjustments are made for privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. States with privatized toll roads have their apportionments reduced based on the percentage of privatized lane mileage relative to the total National Highway System. The apportionment for states with privatized toll roads is reduced based on the percentage of privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled. This adjustment would decrease apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, while increasing apportionments for all other states. The apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado are reduced, while all other states see an increase. MAP-21 does not have an equity program like SAFETEA, but it ensures states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments. The \"initial amount\" for each state is determined based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. A 95% rate of return on payments to the HTF is guaranteed, with a potential adjustment process if funding is insufficient. Some states may prefer using state return on payments rather than total funding share due to earmarking legacy issues from SAFETEA. The SAFETEA bill included a large number of earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% of highway earmark funding being \"below the line\" and not bringing additional money to states. The remaining 33% of earmark funding was \"above the line\" and increased funds flowing to states, benefiting those that previously obtained above-the-line earmarks. Under MAP-21, states that did well in obtaining above-the-line earmarks under SAFETEA would receive higher base amounts in highway program funding. The unequal distribution of earmarks among states and Members of Congress was controversial under SAFETEA. Continuing to credit these earmarks in MAP-21 could favor states that fared well previously. Under MAP-21, the distribution of earmarks among states and Members of Congress remains controversial. The number of funding programs is reduced by two-thirds, with most eligibilities absorbed into core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013, with the NHPP receiving $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. The NHPP program under MAP-21 would be the largest within the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program, receiving $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. It aims to improve the condition and performance of the National Highway System by combining three SAFETEA core programs. Projects under NHPP include achieving national performance goals, highway segment improvements, bridge construction, and inspection costs. The NHPP program under MAP-21 aims to improve the National Highway System by focusing on system maintenance, bridge construction, and environmental restoration. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets, with a limit of 40% of funding for new capacity projects. The NHPP program under MAP-21 requires states to develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. Funds may be transferred if Interstate System and NHS bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The program aims to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads, replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. The Transportation Enhancement (TE) set-aside shifts to the enhanced CMAQ program, with TMP funds eligible for transit uses. The Transportation Enhancement (TE) set-aside shifts to the enhanced CMAQ program, with TMP funds eligible for various transportation projects including transit uses, carpool programs, traveler information, congestion pricing, and recreational trails. TMP funds can also be used for state participation in natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to transportation projects. The Transportation Enhancement (TE) set-aside shifts to the enhanced CMAQ program, with TMP funds eligible for various transportation projects including transit uses, carpool programs, traveler information, congestion pricing, and recreational trails. TMP funds can also be used for state participation in natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to projects under Title 23 U.S.C. Fifty percent of each state's apportionment is to be sub-apportioned within the state based on population categories. States would face penalties if deficient bridge deck area increases. The state's apportionment is based on population categories within the state. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be eliminated, giving states more flexibility in spending. The CMAQ program would be expanded under MAP-21, receiving roughly $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Eligibility for CMAQ funding would be expanded. Under MAP-21, the CMAQ program would receive $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. HSIP funding would remain at $2.5 billion annually for the same period, supporting safety improvements on road infrastructure. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished, but their project eligibilities retained. The MAP-21 legislation includes funding for road improvements such as rumble strips, with HSIP receiving $2.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be eliminated, while a new National Freight Program (NFP) would be established with $2 billion in annual funding. MAP-21 also reduces the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs from 50% to 20%. H.R. 7 would consolidate or eliminate many programs, retaining core program structure but expanding NHS and STP. Interstate Maintenance program would merge into NHS, while Highway Safety Improvement Program would be kept. STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements would remain at 10%. The Highway Bridge Program would be folded into the National Highway System Program under H.R. 7, which also retains the Highway Safety Improvement Program. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated, with many absorbed or eliminated programs continuing under other programs. The total obligation limitations for core highway programs for FY2013 through FY2016 amount to $150.7 billion, with an additional $8 billion provided for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. H.R. 7, the largest formula program in the bill, would expand funding for the National Highway System program to cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Projects must align with national performance goals and states must develop asset management plans for the NHS. STP has broad eligibility criteria and H.R. 7 would authorize $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2016. The bill, H.R. 7, would authorize $42.4 billion for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014. It broadens the program's purpose to include the construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The requirement for setting aside 10% of STP funds for transportation enhancement purposes would be eliminated, but projects on roads functionally classified as local or rural minor collectors would still be prohibited unless they were on the federal-aid highway system in 1991. H.R. 7 authorizes $42.4 billion for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) for FY2013-FY2014, with changes including setting aside 10% of funds for transportation enhancement purposes. The bill allows up to 15% of STP funds for areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on roads classified as minor collectors. States must consult with local planning organizations for projects in population areas of 5,000 to 200,000. $10.4 billion is allocated for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) with states required to have their own safety programs and plans to receive funds. H.R. 7 would provide $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), requiring states to have their own safety programs and plans to receive funds. Plans must set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress annually. Additionally, $8 billion would be allocated for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) over the same period. Each state would receive a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway users' payments. H.R. 7 would amend the existing program to guarantee each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway users' payments. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year to fulfill the guarantee. If needed, the STP authorization would be decreased to provide additional funds. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. The Senate bill, Section 1107, clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. It specifies that ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways and limits U.S. territories to $20 million in a fiscal year. The $100 million ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a state is removed, and the 180-day emergency period for federal government payment of repair costs can be adjusted for time lost due to lack of access to damaged areas. The $100 million ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a state would be eliminated, and the 180-day emergency period for federal government payment of repair costs can be adjusted for time lost due to lack of access to damaged facilities. Additionally, the federal share may be 100% if repair costs exceed the annual state apportionment under 23 U.S.C. 104. H.R. 7, Section 1111, defines \"comparable facility\" for allowable \"maximum total project costs\" as meeting current geometric and construction standards for traffic volume. Debris removal costs reimbursement would be limited to expenses not covered by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, and U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a single fiscal year. The Senate bill, Section 1116, proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program. This new program includes the Tribal Transportation Program, the Federal Lands Transportation Program, and the Federal Lands. Assistance for debris removal costs is limited to expenses not covered by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, with U.S. territories capped at $20 million per fiscal year. Emergency relief funding would be available for federal lands highways and tribal roads, even if they are not on the federal-aid highway system. The Federal Lands Highways Programs would be restructured to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program under the Senate bill. This new program includes the Tribal Transportation Program, the Federal Lands Transportation Program, and the Federal Lands Access Program. The Tribal Transportation Program would receive $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would receive $550 million annually. Changes in the Tribal Transportation Program include a new formula for distributing funds among tribes based on road mileage and tribal population. Funding from the Federal Lands Access Program would be allocated among states based on federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016, while the Federal Lands Transportation program is authorized at $535 million annually for the same period. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013, with set-asides for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. H.R. 7 authorizes funding for the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually from the alternative transportation account for FY2013-FY2016. The Territorial Highway Program is also funded at $50 million annually for the same period. The Senate bill incorporates the ADHS into the Transportation Mobility Program and raises the federal share payable for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. H.R. 7 authorizes funding for the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually from the alternative transportation account for FY2013-FY2016. The bill also retains the Transportation Mobility Program, with funds available until expended and states allowed to use toll credits for the local matching share. Budget authority of $1 billion is provided for FY2013 under the Senate bill, establishing a program similar to SAFETEA. The Senate bill, Section 1118, establishes a $1 billion discretionary program for high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects. The program aims to improve national and regional economic benefits, reduce congestion, enhance energy security, and promote transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on project selection within three years of enactment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is mandated to report on project selection within three years of enactment. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would establish a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities with funding distributed based on passengers, vehicles, and route miles serviced. The MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013 for ferry systems. Funds would require an appropriation to be made available, with eligibility for formula funds under the National Highway Performance Program. The House bill (H.R. 7) would modify the existing Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program, funding it at $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016. Distribution of funds would differ from the Senate bill proposal. The proposed H.R. 7 would fund the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. Funds would be distributed to states with eligible ferry systems based on vehicles, passengers, and nautical route miles. Ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would also be eligible for formula funds. The National Highway System Program includes ferry boats and facilities eligible for formula funds. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects. MAP-21 proposes to increase TIFIA funding to $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund. The bill proposes to significantly expand the TIFIA program by authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund, up from $122 million in SAFETEA. This increase would cover administrative and subsidy costs, with administrative costs capped at 1%. The share of project costs that TIFIA may provide would also increase from 33% to 49%, potentially reducing the need for nonfederal resources. Additionally, credit assistance could be provided for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" The MAP-21 bill proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including allowing credit assistance for projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" The threshold for eligible projects remains at $50 million, except for rural infrastructure projects, which have a proposed threshold of $25 million. This change is sought by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accelerate financing for transit projects. The MAP-21 bill proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including $25 million for rural infrastructure projects. Rural projects would receive loans at half the Treasury rate and 10% of TIFIA funds are reserved for them. Evaluation criteria for projects seeking TIFIA assistance would be abolished, and projects would be assessed on a first-come, first-served basis. Project sponsors could enter into a master credit agreement for future credit assistance once funding is exhausted for the year. The MAP-21 bill proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including $25 million for rural infrastructure projects. Evaluation criteria for projects seeking TIFIA assistance would be abolished, and projects would be evaluated solely on a first-come, first-served basis. Funding can be exhausted for the year, and project sponsors could enter into a master credit agreement for future credit assistance. H.R. 7 proposes to increase funding for the TIFIA program, with $750 million per year allocated for state infrastructure banks. The bill eliminates evaluation criteria for TIFIA assistance, establishes master credit agreements, and raises the maximum federal assistance to 49%. Additionally, it introduces new thresholds for rural projects and assistance under master credit agreements. H.R. 7 proposes to increase funding for the TIFIA program and authorize $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. It eliminates evaluation criteria, establishes master credit agreements, and raises the maximum federal assistance to 49%. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with most funding provided through regular highway programs. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) propose changes to funding for freight transportation. MAP-21 creates a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while H.R. 7 contains provisions that impact freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan. The House bill (H.R. 7) contains provisions that significantly affect freight transport, including requiring the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare a national freight transport plan and seeking to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. Additionally, MAP-21 proposes a new core program to direct funds to infrastructure segments critical to freight movement. The House bill (H.R. 7) includes provisions for a national freight transport plan and private-sector involvement in financing transportation improvements. MAP-21 introduces a program to allocate funds to infrastructure crucial for freight movement, including the designation of a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways. States are directed to prioritize spending on the PFN before other freight-related infrastructure, with the option for the Secretary of Transportation to add up to 3,000 additional miles based on future freight importance. The PFN designation is to be reviewed and updated every decade. The PFN can be expanded by up to 3,000 centerline miles every decade based on future freight importance. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" connecting to the PFN or Interstate System, with a maximum of 20% of funds allocated for these roads. The NFM includes critical rural freight corridors, non-PFN Interstate segments, and the PFN. States can use funds on non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows cost-effectively. States can spend funds from the national freight network (NFM) on non-Interstate highways or transit projects to improve freight flows. Up to 10% of the funds can be used for freight rail or maritime projects if approved by the Secretary of Transportation. Creating a specific funding program for freight movement and requiring states to develop performance measures will enhance consideration of freight needs in project selection. The PFN, consisting of about 30,000 miles of highway, concentrates funds on critical segments. The designation of a PFN consisting of about 30,000 miles of highway would focus funds on critical segments for freight movement. DOT estimates that congested segments, mainly at urban interchanges, cause trucks to travel below the speed limit or experience stop-and-go conditions during rush hours. States may be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks. Programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ may be more suitable for addressing these issues. The Senate and House bills under MAP-21 focus on funding projects for freight transport, with the Senate bill requiring a study on truck size and weight limits. The House bill aims to concentrate funding for freight by reducing funding for non-shipping programs and increasing reliance on tolling for highway construction. Terminating the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund in the House bill could benefit roadway maintenance and construction, particularly for truck transportation. The House bill aims to increase funding for roadway maintenance and construction by transferring federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund. It also proposes greater reliance on tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations. The bill includes provisions for a DOT study on increasing truck weight limits and increasing the permitted length of double trailers for truck carriers. The House bill proposes increasing the permitted length of double trailers for LTL carriers to 33 feet and for truckload carriers to 53 feet. It also allows auto transporters to be 80 feet long and includes a pilot program for increased truck weights on Interstate Highways. Weight exemption for idle reduction equipment was raised to 550 pounds. For rail and maritime freight provisions, refer to specific sections in the report. MAP-21 would bring significant changes to transportation planning requirements at various levels. MAP-21 proposes substantial changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, emphasizing the use of performance management. It suggests including performance measures and targets in state and metropolitan planning, with consequences for failing to meet targets being mild. MAP-21 emphasizes performance management in transportation planning, with states and MPOs setting their own performance measures and targets. Failure to meet targets results in a remedial plan. The National Freight Program requires a national freight strategic plan with quantifiable performance measures. States must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. Failure to make progress requires a freight performance improvement plan submission to the Secretary of Transportation. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement. Failure to meet these targets necessitates the submission of a freight performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan are included in the Act, sometimes overlapping or conflicting with other sections. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act under MAP-21 requires states to set performance targets for freight movement. Failure to meet these targets necessitates the submission of a freight performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. Provisions in Division A, Title I include examples of repetitive and conflicting provisions related to national goals for reducing traffic fatalities and developing strategic freight plans. Each state must develop a risk-based asset management plan with performance targets and an investment strategy under the new National Highway Performance Program. States failing to make progress towards targets must submit a plan of action. Each state must develop a risk-based asset management plan with performance targets and an investment strategy under the new National Highway Performance Program. States failing to make progress towards targets must submit a plan of action. The Secretary would set minimum standards for pavement condition on the Interstate System and bridge condition on the NHS. States could be required to redirect federal apportionments if facilities fall below the minimum standards. Statewide transportation plans and improvement programs would still be required, with some changes under Section 1202 of MAP-21. Under MAP-21, states must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies. Changes in Section 1202 require statewide transportation plans to incorporate metropolitan plans without change. States must now cooperate with nonmetropolitan areas in plan development, using a performance-based approach with coordinated measures and targets. Performance plans must align with national freight strategic plans. MAP-21 requires states to incorporate a performance-based approach into transportation planning, including coordination with national freight strategic plans. It proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with different minimum technical requirements. Tier I MPOs will need to implement performance-based planning and targets, evaluated by DOT for certification. Regulations for minimum requirements must be issued within one year of enactment. The Secretary must establish regulations for minimum requirements for Tier I and Tier II MPOs within one year of enactment. Tier I MPOs will need to implement performance-based planning and targets, evaluated by DOT for certification. Tier II MPOs will have more discretion in meeting requirements, which may include performance measures. MAP-21 allows for the optional development of multiple scenarios and requires MPO designation only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more. MAP-21 proposes to require the designation of MPOs only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more, up from 50,000. MPOs in areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population may be terminated unless reaffirmed by the MPO, governor, and approved by the Secretary. The legislation aims to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region, but allows for multiple MPOs if agreed upon by the governor and existing MPO. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, aims to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region but allows for multiple MPOs if agreed upon by the governor and existing MPO. It also requires the development of a national strategic transportation plan by DOT, including projects of national and regional significance, with cost estimates and updates every two years. Additionally, H.R. 7 mandates the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals. The national plan under H.R. 7 includes cost estimates and must be updated every two years. It also requires the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals, including measures for congestion at airports and freight rail corridors. States must report annually on their progress towards meeting performance targets in the statewide transportation planning process. H.R. 7 mandates the identification of significant projects in the long-range plan, addressing congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. It also emphasizes the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. Additionally, it involves regional transportation planning organizations in project selection and proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000. H.R. 7 proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000 and emphasizes the role of intercity buses in metropolitan transportation planning. Budgetary pressures have raised concerns about transportation project resource allocation and project delivery speed. The federal government's role in project delivery, specifically in expediting the environmental review process for highway and transit projects, is a key focus in both House and Senate proposals. This process involves activities starting in the planning stage and concluding in the preliminary engineering and design stage, with documentation and analysis to identify and consider project-related impacts on the environment. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves identifying and considering all potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment, ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Various environmental requirements may apply, such as obtaining permits for construction projects, mitigating effects on historic sites, or avoiding adverse impacts on parks and wildlife refuges. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves identifying and considering all potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment, ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Activities include mitigating project effects on historic sites and avoiding adverse impacts on parks, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, or historic sites. NEPA documentation, analysis, and review are required for all proposed federal-aid highway or transit projects before final design activities can proceed. Compliance with environmental requirements must be reflected in the NEPA document. The DOT policy requires coordination of environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations as a single process, with compliance reflected in the NEPA document. Recent legislative efforts focus on expediting environmental reviews, extending beyond NEPA requirements. The House proposal and MAP-21 focus on NEPA compliance for highway and transit projects, with the House proposal suggesting more sweeping changes. Both aim to expedite project delivery by altering environmental compliance requirements, but the impact on project timelines is uncertain. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 may lead to procedural changes that could slow project delivery by altering the environmental review process for transportation projects. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including those under NEPA, must be ensured before project construction can proceed. Before project construction can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure that the environmental review process for the project is complete. This process includes preparing an environmental impact statement if the project may significantly affect the environment. Projects with no significant environmental impacts are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA. DOT's NEPA regulations list two groups of actions that are generally CEs. The Department of Transportation's NEPA regulations categorically exclude highway projects with no significant environmental impact. Approximately 90% of approved projects are processed as categorical exclusions, while 6% require an Environmental Assessment. MAP-21 introduces changes to the environmental review process, including new requirements for accelerated decision-making and federal project review. Under MAP-21, new provisions would be established for issue resolution and financial transfer in the environmental review process. These changes aim to ensure timely project deadlines, resolve disputes, and penalize agencies for delays in issuing required approvals. Under new provisions, agencies failing to issue required permits or approvals may face financial penalties. The responsible agency must transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly to expedite decision-making on applications. Transfers are mandated 180 days after application completion or final project decision under NEPA. Delays not caused by the agency are exempt. Various agencies, such as EPA or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, handle approvals for DOT projects. Divisions within these agencies may process numerous permit applications. The approval process for transportation projects may involve agencies like EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in issuing permits can be caused by under-staffing or lack of funds. Redirecting funds to expedite one project may slow down others. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of different environmental assessments. The approval process for transportation projects involving various agencies may face delays due to staffing or funding issues. MAP-21 mandates DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments, which could potentially impact the processing of other applications. Reporting on these assessments to Congress is required within a year of enactment, without specific funding allocated for the task. Determining completion times for NEPA documents as directed by Section 1316 may pose challenges. Determining completion times for NEPA documents, as directed by Section 1316, may be challenging. Little data is available for projects processed with EAs or CEs, and state DOTs generally do not track the time for NEPA compliance. Extracting accurate information about specific NEPA process activities may not be possible. Congress may require states to start tracking this information to meet directives. To comply with Congress's directives, the Department of Transportation (DOT) may require states to track and report the time it takes to complete activities related to the NEPA process. This would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process. Provisions in MAP-21 concerning Categorical Exclusions (CEs) involve directing DOT to survey state agencies for new CEs suggestions and to update CE regulations by moving certain projects from requiring DOT approval to not needing additional approval. The Department of Transportation (DOT) would be directed to update CE regulations by adding projects to the list of categorical exclusions and moving certain projects from requiring DOT approval to not needing additional approval. Provisions also include specifying DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for designating projects within highway right-of-ways as categorical exclusions. The provisions under Section 1309 would continue or amend environment-related programs established under SAFETEA. This includes authorizing federal transportation funds for dedicated staff at a federal agency to support activities expediting transportation project planning. States can use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. The State Assumption of Responsibilities for Categorical Exclusions would allow states to use transportation funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program would make the pilot program permanent, allowing any state to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. Additional environment-specific provisions in MAP-21 reinforce the importance of certain activities and clarify NEPA compliance requirements. Provisions under MAP-21's Subtitle C reinforce the importance of activities DOT is implementing and clarify NEPA compliance requirements for federal highway and transit projects. NEPA may no longer apply to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. The proposed changes under H.R. 7 would significantly alter NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. Projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs would no longer be subject to NEPA. For projects still under NEPA, the bill would modify the compliance process by altering project alternatives, document formats, analysis requirements, evaluation levels for cumulative impacts, and establishing specific timeframes for permits and approvals. The House proposal under H.R. 4348 aims to streamline the environmental review process for federal highway and transit projects by setting deadlines for permits, limiting judicial review, and amending requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language, ensuring that the streamlining provisions will not be challenged. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes streamlining provisions to speed up project delivery and avoid challenges. MAP-21 allows state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, combining design and construction responsibilities. The innovative CM/GC contract method combines design and construction responsibilities, allowing a single contractor to accelerate project delivery. H.R. 7 provides specific authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, while MAP-21 increases federal funding for projects using innovative delivery methods. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects with innovative delivery methods. It also creates a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" allows advance payment of moving costs for people and businesses affected by highway projects, without limiting the number of participating states. This program aims to expedite the relocation of individuals from project right-of-ways, but is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. State transportation officials recommend allowing states to use their own property acquisition and relocation laws if they meet federal requirements. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) would be revised under Section 1113 of MAP-21 to fund projects reducing transportation-related pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets air quality standards, including National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). The CMAQ program was established to provide funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Proposed amendments would change how program funding levels are established. Proposed amendments to the CMAQ program under MAP-21 would change how program funding levels are established and apportioned to states based on previous funding amounts. The CMAQ program under MAP-21 proposes changes in funding levels for FYs 2012 and 2013. Funding would be tied to previous amounts, with 10% of STP funds also factored in. States must reserve a portion for specific transportation projects like recreational trails and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. The recreational trails program under the CMAQ program involves planning, designing, and constructing road projects to provide transportation choices for pedestrians and cyclists. Half of the CMAQ funds would be suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, with distribution based on a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. Additionally, funds must be obligated based on population and fine particulate levels in these areas. The CMAQ program involves prioritizing fund distribution for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, with requirements for population-based obligations and low-emissions equipment purchases. States in attainment for NAAQS can also use funds for eligible projects. MAP-21 provisions may change program implementation significantly. Proposed changes to the CMAQ program include prioritizing fund distribution for projects in nonattainment areas for PM 2.5, evaluating project cost-effectiveness, and allowing optional technical assessments for emissions reductions. Optional Programmatic Eligibility for emissions reductions in selected projects under the CMAQ program is allowed at the discretion of MPOs. Proposed changes in H.R. 7 include requiring MPOs to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects and amending project eligibility requirements. Current laws provide incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels production. Laws offer incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels production. Non-tax incentives include credits under the CAFE program for automakers. Various highway programs also provide incentives, such as allowing low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend these incentives. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, including tax credits and access to HOV lanes. The bills also propose limits on states' authority to exempt vehicles in HOV lanes if they fall below minimum average speed. Additionally, they support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds to be used for new charging stations at parking facilities. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 propose amendments to support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, including new charging stations at parking facilities. MAP-21 also includes provisions for clean fuel buses and facilities, as well as zero emission buses. MAP-21 includes provisions for \"zero emission buses\" that do not emit carbon or particulate matter, while H.R. 7 lacks similar provisions. The Senate's public transit provisions in MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizes $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion each year for FY2013 through FY2016. The legislation would eliminate the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfer $40 billion from the general fund into the alternative transportation account. The FPTA in MAP-21 includes restructuring of the federal transit program, replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a State of Good Repair Grant Program. The Fixed Guideway Modernization Program is being replaced with a new State of Good Repair Grant Program in H.R. 7. The proposed program includes four components: High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems. Funding would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and be distributed by a new formula. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would provide competitive grants for fixed guideway systems upkeep, funded by the general fund. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would distribute competitive grants for the upkeep of fixed guideway systems, funded by the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities accessible to high-occupancy vehicles, funded by the mass transit account. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would provide competitive grants for bus maintenance and facilities, with $75 million set aside from the New Starts program. The FPTA would eliminate the discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program. The FPTA proposes significant changes to transportation funding, including setting aside $75 million from the New Starts program. The heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program would be eliminated, with some of its funding added to other formula programs. The Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program would be combined into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be shifted to the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. The Senate bill proposes creating the Access to Jobs program, requiring recipients to allocate 3% of their Urbanized Area funds to help low-income individuals access employment. It also introduces the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for capital and operating costs during emergencies. The House bill (H.R. 7) allocates $20 million from the Non-Urbanized Area funds and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for disaster-related funding. It doubles the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. The bill maintains the federal transit program structure but eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and the Transit in Parks Program. The House bill (H.R. 7) largely maintains the current structure of the federal transit program but eliminates some programs such as the Clean Fuels Grant Program, Transit in Parks Program, and Growing and High Density State Formula. It combines the New Freedom Program, Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Program, and Jobs Access and Reverse Commute Program into a single program. Funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program would be distributed by formula, unlike in SAFETEA where it was a discretionary program. Funding would now only go to providers of bus transit in urbanized areas without heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail. H.R. 7 proposes changes to the federal transit program, including providing funding to all types of transit agencies in urbanized and non-urbanized areas. It also incentivizes contracting out bus services and allows private intercity operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill focuses on investing in existing fixed guideway systems for capacity and functionality improvements. The bill proposes significant changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects in existing fixed guideway systems. It simplifies the process by reducing stages to project development, engineering, and construction. Eliminating the separate alternatives analysis, applicants must apply to the Secretary of Transportation and initiate the NEPA process. The bill proposes changes to the NEPA process, eliminating the separate alternatives analysis and requiring project sponsors to provide information for project justification and local financial commitment. Projects can enter the Engineering Phase after completing the NEPA process and meeting certain criteria, with a two-year timeline for project development. Successful projects can then enter into a full funding grant agreement. The bill aims to expedite project approval by selecting a preferred alternative, adopting it into the metropolitan plan, and justifying its merits. Successful projects can enter a full funding grant agreement for federal assistance and move into the construction phase. The bill also includes special warrants for projects with federal shares of $100 million or less. However, it eliminates the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. Additionally, a pilot program for expedited project delivery for three projects is proposed to test innovative project development and financing methods. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain new fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects. It maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts projects. The bill eliminates the alternatives analysis but requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. It includes provisions for project expediting, such as special warrants for projects with federal assistance of $100 million or less. H.R. 7 starts funding for Small Starts projects and includes provisions for expediting project evaluation. It changes project justification criteria by adding factors like private contributions and intermodal connectivity. The Senate bill maintains the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas over 200,000 people. H.R. 7 includes provisions for funding Small Starts projects and expediting project evaluation. It allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use a percentage of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. Additionally, funds can be used for operating expenses in urbanized areas with high unemployment rates for up to three years. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people with 100 buses or fewer in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. The cost share varies based on the number of buses operated, with a maximum of 50% federal funding for systems with 75 or fewer buses. H.R. 7 allows transit bus systems to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses operated. The cost share ranges from 25% federal, 75% local for systems with 76-100 buses to 50% federal for systems with 75 or fewer buses. The bill also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% and calls for the development of a national rail plan. The bill calls for the development of a national rail plan for passenger and freight rail, with priority routes to be identified. Regional rail plans, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor, will be developed to refine the national plan for each region. States may also create state rail plans to further refine the regional plans. The plans will be relevant for federal capital grants for intercity passenger service. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, and Amtrak is required to submit a new plan. The bill requires the development of a national rail plan for passenger and freight rail, with priority routes identified. States can create state rail plans to refine regional plans. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, and Amtrak must submit a new plan for high-speed service. DOT is required to develop guidance on measuring train delays, conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and survey track access arrangements within two years. The bill requires DOT to survey and report on track access arrangements for intercity passenger rail operating on other railroads' tracks. It aims to develop a standardized equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services controlled by Amtrak and states. Amtrak would be eligible for capital grants for corridor passenger service. The equipment pool may hinder innovation in car design but aims to achieve economies of scale. The equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services aims to achieve economies of scale in car production and maintenance but may discourage innovation in car design. Implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design by potentially aligning FRA regulations with foreign requirements, facilitating a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal certain regulations. Implementation of positive train control could lead to modifications in FRA requirements to align with foreign standards, potentially creating a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program and reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants. H.R. 7 would eliminate funding for intercity passenger rail grants in FY2011 and FY2012, reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants, and amend the law on food and beverage service on Amtrak trains. It would repeal the self-supporting requirement for food and beverage service, require competitive bidding for the service, and only allow subsidies to cover net costs. H.R. 7 would amend federal grant programs for relocating railroad lines and the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program to include new provisions such as competitive bidding for food and beverage services on Amtrak trains and accepting state or local subsidies as collateral for loans. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing state or local subsidies as collateral and expanding eligible uses of RRIF loans. It also suggests modifications to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the ceiling on freight charge cases and imposing shorter procedural deadlines. The bill proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the ceiling on freight charge cases and imposing shorter procedural deadlines. It also requires the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs, compile and report railroad service complaints, review staffing needs, repeal a capital grant program for smaller railroads, and facilitate access to the RRIF loan program. Positive train control (PTC) was mandated by Congress in 2008 in response to a deadly train collision. The bill includes provisions to facilitate access to the RRIF loan program and addresses the implementation of positive train control (PTC) for passenger and freight railroads. PTC is a safety measure that relies on radio signaling to prevent accidents. The Senate bill may extend the deadline for PTC implementation beyond December 31, 2015. The Senate bill allows for extending the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, citing spectrum limitations in urban areas as a challenge. It also makes PTC implementation eligible for RRIF funding and requires a joint study on spectrum needs. The House bill extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for passenger routes and removes it for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals, offering railroads the option of equivalent safety measures. The Senate bill extends the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology to address spectrum limitations in urban areas. It also allows for PTC implementation to be funded through RRIF and requires a study on spectrum needs. H.R. 7 offers railroads the option of equivalent safety measures and adjusts the routes for PTC installation. Additionally, the bill includes new highway safety programs under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), such as incentivizing states to enforce texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18 as primary offenses. It also increases the maximum civil penalty for vehicle safety defects and mandates event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting in 2015. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes consolidating various highway safety grant programs into one general program with reduced funding. It also prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating checkpoints for motorcyclists. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013 and includes the creation of a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results by commercial entities. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013, creating a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results by commercial drivers. Both House and Senate bills aim to prevent \"reincarnated carriers\" from resuming operations under a new name after safety violations. Similar funding levels for truck safety grants to states are provided in FY2013. The transit safety section in MAP-21 (\u00a720021) authorizes DOT to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems not regulated by DOT, create a safety certification program, and ensure state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. H.R. 7 aims to establish a safety certification program for rail transit operations, ensuring state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. It authorizes grants to states for this program and directs DOT to certify oversight organizations' technical capacity. The proposed legislation would prioritize safety and state of good repair projects for transit agencies before other projects receive funding. It includes provisions for DOT to certify state safety oversight organizations and allocate $4.6 million annually for financial assistance. Additionally, both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize funding for transportation research and education, technology deployment programs, and prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. The bills include a grant program to accelerate ITS deployment and authorize prize competitions for transportation innovations. They direct studies on safety, cost analysis, congestion reduction, infrastructure investment needs, and financing options. Both bills authorize grants for university transportation centers, with MAP-21 at 35 grants annually and H.R. 7 at 30 grants annually. They also emphasize fully spending revenues in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for waterside infrastructure maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund should be fully spent by the Army Corps of Engineers for waterside infrastructure maintenance. Congress currently appropriates only half of the cargo tax collected for this purpose. House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language to ensure that the total budgetary resources provided equal the receipts credited to the Fund, restricting the use of funds to harbor maintenance programs."
