Congress funds programs to improve STEM skills, encourage students to pursue science and engineering degrees, and support research experiences at universities. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and address U.S. S&E workforce needs through changes to immigration policies. Labor economists examine factors such as employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates to determine evidence of labor shortages. This report provides data on employment, wage, and unemployment in the S&E workforce. The report examines past, current, and projected S&E workforce trends, focusing on employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates. It provides data on employment, wage, and unemployment for various S&E occupations from 2016, recent trends from 2012-2016, and projections for 2016-2026. The report analyzes past, current, and projected trends in S&E workforce, focusing on employment, wages, and unemployment. It includes data on S&E occupations from 2016, recent trends from 2012-2016, and projections for 2016-2026. Stakeholder perspectives are also provided for Congress to consider ensuring an adequate S&E workforce for the 21st century. The S&E workforce lacks a definitive definition, with various terms and occupations included in different analyses. The size of the workforce varies depending on the definition used, with estimates ranging from approximately 6 million in 2013. The National Science Board's 2016 report stated that the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce size ranges from 6 million to over 21 million depending on the definition used. The focus of the policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce is on computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. This workforce does not include social scientists. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million, excluding social scientists and S&E-related technicians. The report categorizes scientists and engineers into six S&E occupational groups using a modified version of the SOC system. The report categorizes scientists and engineers into six S&E occupational groups: Computer occupations, Mathematical occupations, and Engineers in various specialties. The report categorizes scientists and engineers into six S&E occupational groups, including aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, chemical, civil, computer hardware, electrical, electronics, environmental, health and safety, industrial, materials, mechanical, mining, geological, nuclear, and petroleum engineers, as well as marine engineers and naval architects, life scientists, physical scientists, and other related specialties. The report categorizes scientists and engineers into six S&E occupational groups, including various types of engineers, life scientists, physical scientists, and other related specialties. Detailed occupations and educational composition are provided in the appendices, relying on federal government data sources. The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey provides employment and wage data for 2012-2016, covering part-time and full-time workers. The survey does not include self-employed individuals. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage,\" calculated by averaging wages of all employees in a given occupation. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of unemployment data in this report. BLS's Employment Projections provide occupational and industry employment projection data for 10-year periods. OES survey data supplement CPS data in BLS employment projections. The OES survey provides occupational staffing patterns for most industries. CES data offer information on total wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries. The OES survey provides occupational staffing patterns for most industries, while CES data offer information on total wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries. The employment projections also include agricultural industry employment and the self-employed to determine base year employment levels for each occupation. The \"Recent Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" section covers changes from 2012 to 2016, while the \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section relies on BLS projections for that timeframe. Various factors can impact the size and occupational composition of the workforce. The \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section relies on the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for the 2016-2026 period. Various factors such as economic conditions, technology development, funding for research, and workforce skills can affect the size and composition of the U.S. S&E workforce. The report does not attribute workforce changes to specific factors. The report discusses factors influencing the U.S. S&E workforce, including skills of foreign-born workers and changes in business practices. It notes challenges in comparing OES data over time due to various factors affecting data comparability. Changes in data collection methods, survey reference periods, and mean wage estimation methodologies impact occupational classification systems. The 2012-2016 period was chosen for analysis to ensure data comparability and provide current trends in S&E occupations. The OES survey maintained consistent occupational categories based on the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification. The Bureau of Labor Statistics considers population size, composition, and labor force participation rates in its employment projections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses various estimates for employment projections, considering factors like population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, and technological innovation. They also analyze changes in business practices, production methods, and occupational concentration within industries. In their 2016-2026 projections, BLS introduced a new methodology for estimating occupational replacement needs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics introduced a new methodology for estimating occupational separations in their 2016-2026 projections, replacing the previous method due to accuracy issues. Various factors such as immigration laws, technological advances, and consumer preferences can also impact occupational projections. BLS regularly evaluates the accuracy of its projections and publishes these evaluations in its Monthly Labor Review. In 2016, the BLS provided a snapshot of the S&E workforce in the US, with 6.9 million people employed as scientists and engineers, accounting for 4.9% of total employment.

Scientists and engineers are vital to U.S. technological leadership, innovation, and national defense. Congress has enacted programs to support the education and development of scientists and engineers. The Congress has been concerned about the science and engineering workforce for over 60 years, enacting programs to support education and development in STEM fields. There are differing views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce and policies, including increasing foreign scientists and engineers in the U.S. There are varying perspectives on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce in the United States, with debates on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, the nature of such a shortage, and whether the federal government should intervene or let market forces dictate. The debate over the science and engineering workforce in the United States revolves around the potential shortage of scientists and engineers, which could impact the country's leadership in various fields. Despite conflicting views on the existence of a shortage, increasing the number of scientists and engineers is seen as crucial for enhancing innovation, economic performance, and job creation. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is essential for boosting innovation, economic performance, and job creation. S&E degrees provide valuable skills that are beneficial not only in S&E occupations but also in related careers and other fields. Government interventions to address shortages may lead to inefficiencies, with efforts to incentivize S&E degrees and increase immigration quotas being potential solutions. Government interventions to increase the number of scientists and engineers may lead to inefficiencies in the S&E labor market. Workforce projections for S&E occupations are unreliable, resulting in potential mismatches between education and market needs. Unexpected changes in industrial output or employment further complicate long-term projections. Shortages in certain industries, occupations, or fields may exist due to various factors such as technological changes, labor market demographics, and government policies. The labor market will eventually resolve these needs. Shortages in industries like aerospace may arise due to export control laws or restrictions on employing foreign scientists and engineers. The labor market can address these needs if allowed to operate freely, with wages adjusting to balance demand and supply. Government intervention may be necessary to prevent adverse consequences such as loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and compromised national security. Industry claims of shortages may be motivated by cost-cutting motives. Shortages in industries like aerospace may lead to a loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and compromised national security if not addressed through federal efforts to increase supply. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to lower labor costs and replace older workers with younger, lower-cost graduates. The real issue lies in a skills mismatch rather than a shortage of people. Expanding immigration can help address the difficulty employers face in meeting their S&E workforce needs, particularly in information technology. This is due to a skills mismatch between what employers require and what S&E workers possess. Immigration policies aimed at increasing the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the U.S. can leverage the creativity of top talent for the economy and reduce the loss of U.S.-educated foreign nationals with S&E degrees. Expanding immigration to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States may depress wages, increase unemployment, and discourage American students from pursuing STEM degrees and careers. Federal efforts to improve STEM education are needed to address the lagging knowledge of U.S. students compared to foreign students in STEM fields. U.S. students lag behind foreign students in STEM knowledge, leading to concerns about the future of American scientists and engineers, economic growth, and competitiveness. Federal policies are necessary to strengthen K-12 STEM education and address the disparity in knowledge levels. International assessments may not accurately reflect the STEM knowledge of U.S. students, highlighting the need for improved standardized tests and federal support for the development of the S&E workforce. The federal government plays a role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce by considering various perspectives on increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists and engineers, promoting diversity in science and engineering, improving K-12 STEM education, and enhancing career counseling for high school students. Congress may consider these perspectives when addressing U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. The federal government plays a role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce by considering various perspectives on increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists and engineers, promoting diversity in science and engineering, improving K-12 STEM education, and enhancing career counseling for high school students. When addressing U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry, it may consider these perspectives and opinions. BLS publishes data on the educational composition of occupations, using data collected as part of the American Community Survey (ACS). The occupational composition of S&E occupations is illustrated in chart form. The ACS occupational classifications for S&E occupations are shown in chart form in the appendix. Educational levels below associate's degrees are grouped together as \"Less than an Associate's degree,\" encompassing various levels of education."
