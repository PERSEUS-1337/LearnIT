The findings section of the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act\" highlights the lack of a patient registry for breast implant recipients, estimating 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants. The FDA received numerous adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled and saline-filled implants from 1985 to January 2000. Women are emphasized to need complete and accurate information about breast implants. Silicone gel-filled breast implants had 127,770 adverse reaction reports, while saline-filled implants had 65,720 reports from 1985 to January 2000. Women require accurate information on the risks and benefits of breast implants to make informed decisions. Silicone implants were never FDA-approved, while saline implants were approved in 2000 despite high complication rates. After three years, 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery for complications and device failure. In 1998, the FDA launched a criminal investigation into breast implant manufacturers for manipulating research data. The investigation was not disclosed to the FDA panel considering market approval for saline implants in 2000. Despite this, saline breast implants were approved, and the investigation remains ongoing. In 2000, the FDA panel approved saline breast implants without being informed of the ongoing investigation into breast implant manufacturers. Studies showed that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants, and almost 70% had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. Silicone migration was found in 21% of women, with the FDA stating the impact on disease development is unknown. In a 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., University of California, it was found that silicone breast implants can lead to the development of anticollagen antibodies, indicating potential serious implications from their use. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study on silicone breast implant safety also highlighted local complications associated with the implants. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study on silicone breast implant safety emphasized local complications as the primary safety concern. Concerns persist about potential connective tissue or autoimmune diseases from exposure to silicone breast implants. Additionally, a 2001 National Cancer Institute study found higher rates of lung and brain cancer among breast implant recipients. Implant recipients with silicone breast implants may suffer from higher rates of lung and brain cancer. A 1999 case report found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured implants, leading to severe inflammation and complications. Once silicone gel leaks from the implant, it can trigger significant pathological responses. Silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms, masking up to 40% of breast tissue and delaying breast cancer detection in women. Breastfeeding women with implants should be cautious as it is uncertain if silicone may pass into breast milk and its impact on the nursing infant. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants, ensure women receive accurate information about them, and urge the FDA to conclude its investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by manufacturers. The Act does not affect existing regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regarding silicone breast implants for reconstruction, correction of deformities, or replacement for ruptured implants. The National Institutes of Health will provide a report on existing research on silicone breast implants within 90 days. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act will include a section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, who will oversee participation from various Institutes including the Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and National Cancer Institute. Study sections will be established for this purpose. The Director of NIH will establish study sections or special panels to review research grant applications on breast implants. Research will be conducted to understand the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants. The Director of NIH will conduct research to expand understanding of health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study of women with implants for at least eight years. Focus will be on local complications, atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities. The Director of NIH will conduct a study on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, focusing on local complications, atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities. The study will evaluate differences in health compared to suitable controls and an annual report will be submitted to Congress. The FDA will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. Congress will be updated on the implementation status regularly. Additionally, activities regarding silicone breast implants will be expanded and intensified at the FDA. To ensure accurate information on silicone breast implants, the FDA will expedite investigations into wrongdoing by manufacturers, update consumer information materials, and provide timely data on reported issues. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents with accurate information on local complications and ruptures. Manufacturers conducting clinical studies must provide patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet and amend study protocols accordingly. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents with accurate information on local complications and ruptures. Clinical investigators must provide prospective patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet, amend study protocols to ensure patients receive informed consent documents at the initial consultation, inform women about how to obtain a Medwatch form, and provide potential participants with inclusion criteria. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents with accurate information on local complications and ruptures. Clinical investigators must provide prospective patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet, amend study protocols to ensure patients receive informed consent documents at the initial consultation, inform women about how to obtain a Medwatch form, and appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to review breast implant information and advertisements for accuracy. The FDA requires accurate information on local complications and ruptures in silicone breast implant package inserts and informed consent documents. A diverse membership, including breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists, is essential for a thorough and accurate review of breast implant issues."
