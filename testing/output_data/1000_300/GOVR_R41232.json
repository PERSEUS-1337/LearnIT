    "content": "On July 29, 2010, the President signed H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212, which includes $59.2 billion in spending for war costs, disaster assistance, Haiti relief, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House receding from an amended version. The enacted bill provides $58.8 billion in new budget authority after rescissions. The enacted bill, P.L. 111-212, provides $58.8 billion in new budget authority after rescissions. Rescissions and mandatory savings offset the amount of new budget authority required for financing spending. The House debated H.Con.Res. 301 to withdraw troops from Pakistan, which was defeated. The Senate disagreed with the House version of the bill, leading to a failed cloture vote on H.R. 4899. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 failed to adopt a cloture vote on July 22, 2010, leading to the adoption of the Senate version which allocated $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and benefits for Vietnam. This decision was influenced by concerns from Defense Department officials about funding shortages for the Army in August. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 adopts $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The debate revolved around additional domestic spending proposals and the Administration's new war policy in Afghanistan. In introducing the Senate version of H.R. 4899 for House consideration on July 27, 2010, Representative David Obey added funds to FEMA disaster funding in the FY2010 Supplemental for war funding and other emergencies like teacher job losses and Pell fund shortfalls. Domestic proposals were largely paid for with offsets to other programs but fell by the wayside. Representative Obey opposed the bill due to war funding for Afghanistan and Pakistan, lack of support from those governments, and the absence of a proposed House amendment. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending on the backs of troops. Representative Obey opposed the bill due to war funding for Afghanistan and Pakistan, lack of support from those governments, and the absence of a proposed House amendment. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending on the backs of troops. Other members voiced support for various aspects of the bill, including DOD's war funding and additional disability benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Representative Skelton supported the bill, while Representative McGovern raised concerns about corruption and incompetence in the Afghan government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. The House Committee supported the bill, with concerns raised about corruption in the Afghan government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. Funding for the war was a key issue, with worries that it would run out in August. The House also voted on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days. The House Committee supported a bill to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days, but the resolution was defeated. The Senate failed to adopt cloture on the bill, indicating they would not pass it. The Senate was unable to pass the House version of bill H.R. 4899, which appropriated $59.2 billion in spending, $5.0 billion below the request. The final version closely matched the Administration's request for various funds, with some adjustments made. In the final version, Congress approved $2.9 billion for Haiti with small adjustments in individual accounts. The chief differences in funding included $3.8 billion for war-related foreign aid, zero funding for settling court cases and border security, and additional funding for Mexico, Jordan, El Salvador, Vietnam, and Congo. Congress did not include additional domestic funding for teacher layoffs, Pell grants, summer jobs, or other programs. In the final version, Congress did not include additional domestic funding for teacher layoffs, Pell grants, summer jobs, or other programs. Additionally, $400 million was added for flood and drought relief, but $600 million for border security and $129 million to reduce patent backlogs were not included. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 includes $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. $31.5 billion is for the Afghan war, with $29.8 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs; $2.7 billion is for the Iraq war, with $1.0 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 provides $169.9 billion for the Afghan and Iraq wars, with $104.4 billion for the Afghan war and $65.5 billion for the Iraq war. This includes funding for DOD, State/USAID programs, and VA/Medical costs. Additionally, there is $2.0 billion in non-war funding for DOD and $375 million for foreign aid for Pakistan. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. Between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $59.2 billion for disaster relief, war funding, war-related foreign assistance, Haiti relief, and additional benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. H.R. 4899 was passed by the Senate on May 27, 2010, with $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, foreign assistance, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House later added funds for education, Pell Grants, and other programs, bringing the total spending to $81.8 billion. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version, leading to further discussions and disagreements. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the House's amended version of H.R. 4899, leading to disagreements. The House later adopted the Senate's version with $65.1 billion in new funding and $16.7 billion in rescissions. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010, providing supplemental funding for various purposes including deploying more troops for the Afghan War and supporting disaster relief in Haiti. The FY2010 supplemental requests included $5.1 billion for Disaster Relief Fund, $33.0 billion for deploying troops to Afghanistan, $4.5 billion for foreign assistance, $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for Agent Orange veterans, $243 million for Deepwater Horizon oil spill, $600 million for border security, and $3.4 billion to settle land trust claims for American Indians. The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, which included $5.7 billion in supplemental spending. The House bill had $600 million in offsets to reduce the federal deficit. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 4899 included different amounts of offsets to counterbalance the proposed spending. The House bill had $600 million in offsets for $5.7 billion in spending, while the Senate version had $380 million in offsets for $59.3 billion. The amended House bill included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset $81.8 billion in proposed spending. The impact on the deficit depends on the new Budget Authority needed for each version, following Congressional rules for discretionary and mandatory spending limits. The final version of H.R. 4899 included almost all discretionary spending designated as emergency, totaling $45.8 billion. This spending would not count against budget caps set in the FY2010 resolution, but could be subject to a point of order if caps are exceeded. Federal budget rules distinguish between discretionary and mandatory spending, with the President's supplemental request totaling $64.4 billion. The President's supplemental request includes $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as undermining budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on discretionary spending. Emergency supplemental appropriations are perceived as undermining budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on discretionary spending, leading to concerns about their impact on the deficit. Congress must decide if additional spending is necessary and if it warrants approval. Congress may debate increasing spending above the appropriated level for the year, considering whether to raise the budget deficit or offset the spending by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. The FY2010 supplemental appropriations request was considered within budget constraints set by the FY2010 budget resolution and other rules like congressional pay-as-you-go rules and the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Under the FY2010 budget resolution and other budget rules, Congress could exempt spending by designating it as an emergency or for overseas deployments. Waivers could also be used to bypass applicable points of order during consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure. Under budget rules, emergency designations could face a point of order, which can be waived in both houses. Waivers require a special rule in the House and a waiver motion in the Senate. Various agencies have cited deadlines for supplemental funding in H.R. 4899 from March to July 2010, with some flexibility in dates. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano highlighted the urgency in a June 4, 2010 letter to congressional leaders. In a letter to congressional leaders on June 4, 2010, Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities due to insufficient funding for Federal response operations within two weeks. The Coast Guard could reach the $150 million annual cap by June 18, 2010. The Coast Guard could reach the $150 million annual cap on the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund by June 18, 2010. Concerned, Congress passed a bill raising the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon Spill, allowing funds to be withdrawn in increments and reported to Congress within seven days. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for FY2010 war funding. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for FY2010 war funding, with the Secretary of Defense stating the need for an additional $33 billion for troops deploying to Afghanistan. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover their war funding needs if necessary. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover their war funding needs through August 2010, with concerns raised about running out of funds in July. Secretary of Defense Gates urged passage of additional funding by July 4 to avoid disrupting other programs. The Navy and Marine Corps may run out of overseas contingency fund money in July, leading to disruptions in programs. The Army could face funding issues in August, potentially resulting in furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military. Army and Marine Corps funding concerns were raised in mid-July, with differing testimonies on funding sufficiency through August. The Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August, but they have sufficient funds through mid-August according to Under Secretary of the Army, Joseph Westphal. The latest DOD Cost of War report shows available funds for each service, with the Army having $15.3 billion. Monthly spending could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, or sooner if spending increases rapidly. Services have tapped funding since 2004. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, or sooner if spending increased more rapidly. Services have tapped funding from their base budget since 2004 to finance war funding temporarily. FEMA limited the release of the Disaster Relief Fund to last longer pending consideration of the FY2010 Supplemental. In order to make the Disaster Relief Fund last longer, FEMA limited fund releases, delayed reimbursements, and recovered funds from previous years. Despite initial concerns of insolvency by June, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the Disaster Relief Fund as of June 7, 2010. FEMA limited fund releases, delayed reimbursements, and recovered funds from previous years to extend the Disaster Relief Fund. By June 2010, FEMA had a $952 million balance in the fund. However, there was a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment that did not meet immediate needs criteria. The State Department needed its disaster assistance funding replenished by June 1, 2010, to maintain capacity for future humanitarian crises. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation. The State Department required replenishment of its disaster assistance funding by June 1, 2010, to address future humanitarian crises. Congress did not approve the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline for settling the Pigford II court case. The final deadline for Congress to approve the settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for American Indians is August 6, 2010. The settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for American Indians is set for August 6, 2010. Deadlines have been extended, but it is uncertain if further extensions will be granted. Issues raised by Members of Congress include evaluating spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring Haiti relief funds, and determining if additional domestic spending should be considered emergency or require budget offsets. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) due to anticipated fund depletion. FEMA projected the account would run out in May or June 2010, prompting guidance to reduce expenditures. FEMA projected the Disaster Relief Fund would run out in May or June 2010, prompting guidance to reduce expenditures by limiting payments and delaying projects. Congress raised questions about the delay in requesting disaster relief funds earlier. In FY2010, FEMA projected the Disaster Relief Fund would run out prompting guidance to reduce expenditures. Congress raised questions about delays in requesting disaster relief funds earlier and FEMA's budgeting practices. The Obama Administration requested $2.0 billion for the DRF but Congress provided $1.6 billion. In FY2011, the Administration is requesting $1.9 billion for the DRF. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices regarding disaster relief funds. In FY2010, Congress provided $1.6 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, below the $2.0 billion requested. In FY2011, the Administration requested $1.9 billion, citing the need for additional funding due to a high number of disasters in recent years. In recent years, higher funding levels for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) may be necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Some argue for increased funding to avoid the need for supplemental funding, while others believe disasters are unpredictable emergencies. FEMA provided limited information for Congress to evaluate its funding request. FEMA's request for $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was justified by citing an arbitration ruling awarding $475 million to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. More information on how the DRF has been used for past disasters could strengthen the case for additional funding. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided the requested funding, with $5 million allocated to the Department of Homeland Security Office. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, with $5 million allocated to the Department of Homeland Security Office. Additionally, $396 million was added for various disaster relief funding, including floods, fishery disasters, tornado damages, and Gulf Coast hurricane recovery projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding disaster relief funding requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized OMB for delayed information on disaster relief funding, noting a $1-2 billion shortfall for FY2011. H.R. 4899 allocated $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, with additional funding for HUD, Army Corps of Engineers, and Commerce Department for various disaster relief activities. The Army Corps of Engineers receives $227 million for various projects, including repair of federal projects, flood control, coastal emergencies, recovery projects for the Mississippi River, and drought relief. H.R. 4899 also mandates a 90% federal cost share for flood damage recovery in Rhode Island and Tennessee. FEMA is directed to create a taskforce with the Army Corps of Engineers and OMB to address community concerns related to flood map updates. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan as part of the counterinsurgency strategy. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to reverse a deteriorating security situation and break the Taliban's momentum. By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remainder of the 30,000 increase expected to arrive by September 2010. This would triple the number of U.S. troops deployed in October 2008. The troop deployment in Afghanistan increased significantly, with 98,000 troops expected to be deployed by September 2010. This includes a series of troop increases starting from President Bush's term and continuing with President Obama's approval of additional troops. The FY2011 budget also includes 4,000 support troops for Afghanistan. The troop deployment in Afghanistan has increased to 98,000 troops by September 2010, including 4,000 support troops in the FY2011 budget. NATO allies have also increased their troop levels to 48,000, bringing the total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan to about 148,000. Plans call for Afghan security forces to reach 243,000, resulting in a total of 389,000 foreign and Afghan forces. The Defense Department's requested budget includes $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, training Iraq Security Forces, and higher fuel costs. Total DOD war spending in FY2010 is expected to rise to $160 billion. Total DOD war spending in FY2010 is expected to rise to $160 billion, with $99 billion allocated for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The FY2010 Supplemental increased the total appropriations for the Afghan War to $314.1 billion, with a potential rise to $427.7 billion if the FY2011 request is approved. In comparison, the total enacted spending for Iraq is now $705 billion, potentially increasing to $752 billion with approval of the pending FY2011 request. The FY2010 Supplemental increased total appropriations for the Afghan War to $314.1 billion, potentially rising to $427.7 billion with approval of the FY2011 request. President Obama's new strategy includes a timeline for U.S. forces to begin transferring out of Afghanistan in July 2011, with a review in December 2010. The U.S. approved a new deployment in Afghanistan with a timeline for forces to start transferring out in July 2011, subject to review in December 2010. There are concerns about potential delays in the drawdown, with officials cautioning that the process could take several years. General Petraeus described it as an 18-month campaign, to be evaluated in September 2011. The initiative in Afghanistan is described as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Concerns were raised by Congress about the timing of the evaluation, the length of the campaign, and the future of U.S. military involvement. Three amendments were debated and rejected during House consideration of H.R. 4899, aiming to increase congressional participation in decision-making about military commitment. Amendment No. 5, which required a new National Intelligence Estimate and a timetable for troop redeployment in Afghanistan, was defeated in Congress. Concerns about the situation in Afghanistan have increased following the operation in Marjah, with mixed reports about the town's status. The next focus was on the campaign in Kandahar. The U.S. launched an operation to re-take Marjah in Afghanistan, with mixed reports on the town's status. The next focus was on the campaign in Kandahar. A $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan, with funds allocated for military operations, force protection, Afghan security forces training, and higher fuel costs. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request includes funds for various operations in Afghanistan, such as military personnel, force protection, Afghan security forces training, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. The $30 billion request for Afghanistan includes funding for various activities and programs, with different categories increasing at different rates. DOD's estimates differ substantially from CBO's estimates, and the Operations category is expected to increase with troop levels. The Operations category in the FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan is expected to increase with troop levels. DOD's estimated per troop cost is $875,000, higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same average monthly troop strength, with DOD arguing that operations costs are particularly high. DOD and CBO have different estimates for the per troop cost in the FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan. DOD argues that the high operations costs are due to deploying troops to southern Afghanistan, requiring more facilities. In 2009, concerns about accurate budgeting led to $5 billion being transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act transferred $5 billion to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund for military operations. Concerns may arise about the high estimates for DOD's FY2010 request. Obligations for operational costs in the first five months of FY2010 are only 22% of the total requested amount, indicating that DOD's estimates may be too high. The DOD's estimates for FY2010 may be too high as obligations for operational costs are lower than expected. An additional $2.6 billion was requested to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund. Concerns include whether all the funds are necessary and if the ramp-up plan is achievable given training problems and contracting disputes. The DOD's plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011. The Afghan Army would grow to 171,000 by October 2011, and the Afghan Police to 134,000. Concerns exist about the achievability of the plan due to training issues and contracting disputes. In January 2010, NATO partners endorsed increases in funding for Afghan Security Forces. DOD's FY2010 supplemental request of $2.6 billion is aimed at sustaining the growth of the Afghan Army to over 134,000 troops, increasing soldier pay, and improving infrastructure and equipment. Congress has already appropriated $25.5 billion, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total support through FY2011 to $39.8 billion. DOD has not provided estimates on the ultimate cost or duration of U.S. support for Afghan Security forces. DOD has not provided an estimate of the ultimate cost or number of years needed to support Afghan Security forces. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training of Afghan Security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors, with challenges including attrition rates and leadership deficiencies. Training of Afghan Security forces, conducted by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors, has faced numerous challenges. These include attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, limited logistical capabilities, illiteracy, corruption, and attacks on police recruits by insurgents. Coordination issues between DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition training have also been identified. Difficulties in coordinating DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition training; Persistent problems with private contractors including poor performance, unauthorized firearm use, and inadequate vetting; Shortages of contractor personnel and insufficient contract oversight. Senator Levin expressed concerns about a shortfall in trainers for Afghan security forces, with only 44% of required trainers currently assigned. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for Afghan security forces, with only 44% of required trainers currently assigned. Members may want to know the number of trainers needed for training in Afghanistan and how these shortfalls could impact the ramp-up of training programs. The DOD's funding could be affected by a shortfall in trainers for Afghan security forces, potentially hampering the ramp-up of training programs. A bid-protest may have delayed contract awards for Afghan police training, leading to uncertainties in funding and training plans. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals. DOD's original FY2010 request was included in the DOD Appropriations Act. Some question the necessity of emergency war supplementals for FY2010, as DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in available funding from previous years. The original FY2010 request was included in the DOD Appropriations Act, but some argue that certain aspects of the request may warrant an emergency designation. Some of DOD's request, including $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF), $2 billion to offset fuel increases, and $1.7 billion for reset or replacement of war-worn equipment, may not be clearly related to new deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices. DOD argues that the $1 billion for the ISFF is necessary for modernization efforts and to ensure Iraq's security, especially with lower oil revenues. The emergency designation of these funds could be challenged. Some argue that providing $2 billion for higher fuel costs in DOD's budget could be covered internally. DOD typically uses cash reserves or transfers funds for unexpected expenses. However, DOD may argue that an infusion of budget authority is necessary. Another request is $1.7 billion for equipment replacement, which some believe is not directly tied to new troop deployments. The impact of additional combat operations on equipment in Afghanistan is expected to be gradual. The $1.7 billion for equipment replacement, not directly tied to new troop deployments, could be covered internally by DOD. The impact on equipment in Afghanistan from additional combat operations is expected to be gradual. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. Adjustments included decreases in military personnel and operation and maintenance funding, rejection of funding for contingency construction projects, and an increase in procurement accounts for combat losses. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments for protection programs in the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund and a $512 million increase to procurement accounts for combat losses. Both the House and Senate versions approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version also required assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees to be provided to congressional intelligence committees. The Administration requested a total of $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for Afghanistan. Questions arise about whether DOD is building facilities for temporary troops or permanent bases in Afghanistan. Congress allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but not for \"permanent stationing\" of troops. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, with $521 million designated for Afghanistan. Congress allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but not for \"permanent stationing\" of troops. The $521 million request aims to create infrastructure to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan, including roads, runways, quarters, and other facilities. The justification for the request highlighted the need to expand airfield capacity, logistics capacity, and provide necessary infrastructure. Army and Air Force construction projects are split evenly, with a focus on southern provinces like Helmand. The supplemental request for military construction in Afghanistan includes increased airlift and combat operations, logistics capacity at key locations, and infrastructure support. Army projects are focused in southern provinces like Helmand, Nimruz, and Kandahar, as well as Balkh and Kunduz provinces in the north. Air Force construction is planned for Nimruz, Balkh, and Herand provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command headquarters at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tombstone near Lashkar Gah in Helmand. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include infrastructure for waste management, fuel storage, utilities, roads, and command headquarters at various Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) across the country. Air Force construction involves building runways, aprons, and storage facilities at different locations to support airlift and special operations forces. This has been a key concern for Congress regarding long-term spending on construction for U.S. troops in the region. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include infrastructure for waste management, fuel storage, utilities, roads, and command headquarters at various Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) across the country. Congress has expressed concerns about long-term spending on construction for U.S. troops in the region, particularly regarding the establishment of permanent bases. In the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress prohibited the use of defense funds to establish any military installation or base in Afghanistan. In the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-84), Congress banned the use of defense funds to establish permanent military installations or bases for the stationing of US Armed Forces in Afghanistan. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation also adopted this language, with an exception allowing the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for certain projects. Congress banned the use of defense funds for permanent military installations in Afghanistan, but allowed for long-term presence support using Operation & Maintenance funds. The distinction between permanent stationing and long-term presence projects is unclear, leading to periodic denials of funds for projects signaling permanency. Some projects in supplemental appropriations requests have been denied funds for signaling a permanent presence, such as a fuel facility and power plant at Bagram in FY2005. DOD has flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary facilities to meet urgent military needs since FY2004, with Congress renewing this authority annually until FY2009. Since FY2004, Congress has allowed the use of O&M funds for temporary military facilities to meet urgent needs, with a cap between $100 million and $200 million. In 2009, Congress permitted $200 million for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan, exempting installations from the ban on O&M construction funds. In FY2010, $300 million in O&M funds were allocated for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements, exempting installations from the ban on O&M construction funds supporting a long-term presence. This authority was extended from the previous year, with a total limit of $500 million for projects in Central Command. The use of O&M funding for military construction significantly increased the amount spent on construction, with $409 million added in FY2009 for projects in Afghanistan, totaling $1.4 billion. In FY2009, DOD allocated $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, raising the total to $1.4 billion. This amount nearly equaled the total spent on construction in Afghanistan between FY2003 and FY2008. DOD's construction investment in Afghanistan doubled in a single year. Additionally, DOD proposed using O&M funds for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012, which could further increase funding for military construction in Afghanistan. DOD's commitment in Afghanistan is evident through significant investments in key bases, including $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base, $767 million in Kandahar Air Base, and $595 million in Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. Additionally, DOD has requested new language for FY2011 authorization to use O&M funds for minor military construction projects. The DOD has requested $299 million for a total of $894 million in funding. They are seeking new language for authorization to use O&M funds for unspecified minor military construction projects of up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would allow DOD to draw on O&M funds without a limit for such projects worldwide. The proposal also increases the per project cap from $750,000 to $3 million due to rising construction costs in Afghanistan. The DOD proposed increasing the cap for minor military construction projects from $750,000 to $3 million due to rising costs in Afghanistan. They requested authorization to use O&M funds without a limit for these projects worldwide, with after-the-fact quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees. Questions arose about the urgency of a $521 million supplemental request given DOD's current spending rates and available budget authority. DOD has $2.1 billion in unobligated funds for military construction projects in Afghanistan. The average monthly obligation decreased from $50 million in FY2009 to $26 million in the first five months of FY2010.

The enacted version allocated $3.7 billion for war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations, $714 million less than the Administration's request. Afghanistan's civilian programs were emphasized in the strategy, focusing on governance, economic growth, and social services alongside military efforts. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy in Afghanistan accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery, focusing on increasing stability and reducing insurgency through job creation and social services. Key concerns include the Afghan government's ability to provide leadership and support to conflict-affected communities. The success of the \"surge\" strategy in Afghanistan hinges on the Afghan government's capability to provide leadership and support to local communities affected by conflict. Concerns include corruption hindering effective service delivery and the need for accountability in the distribution of aid. The increase in U.S. aid personnel and offices of inspector general reflects government concerns about corruption in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aimed to boost international affairs funding for the country, with significant increases in aid and State support. The FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account would rise by nearly 90% under the request, and by 86% in the enacted version of H.R. 4899.

Supplemental proposed a 457 position increase, costing $211 million, including 212 U.S. direct hires for district level work, 245 staff for Kabul ministries and PRTs, and 200 locally employed staff for administrative support. The \"whole of government\" approach involved federal employees from various agencies providing specialized skills. The rapid expansion of staff at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, as proposed in the supplemental, has raised concerns about resource strain, particularly in managing staff, housing, and security needs. An additional $14 million for SIGAR and $3 million for the State Department Inspector General was also requested to support these efforts. The request for increased funding for security needs due to the expansion of civilian staff at the U.S. embassy in Kabul includes $14 million for SIGAR and $3 million for the State Department Inspector General.

The enacted version of the bill cuts the ESF request by $267 million compared to the $2.0 billion originally requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends specific funding levels for various program sectors within the ESF account, notably reducing proposed good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. Concerns are raised about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan, leading to limitations on direct government budget support to $100 million. The INCLE account is also cut by $31 million due to doubts about the political will of the Afghan government. The Senate report limits direct government budget support to $100 million due to concerns about the political will of the Afghan government. The enacted version also addresses oversight issues by rejecting the request for SIGAR and rescinding $7.2 million in FY2009 supplemental SIGAR appropriations. Additionally, the enacted legislation contains conditions on Afghanistan aid, including obligations only if the Secretary of State reports on Afghan government representatives. The enacted legislation for Afghanistan aid in the FY10 supplemental appropriations includes conditions such as consulting with Afghan government representatives, measuring progress with specific benchmarks, and supporting reform efforts while respecting human rights and combating corruption.

The FY2010 State operations saw a 43% rise over FY2009 levels. A significant element in the international affairs component was a request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of police training responsibility from DOD to the State Department. The State Department has taken over the responsibility for training police forces in Iraq from the Department of Defense. This transition includes advising the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces. The INCLE program will deploy 350 advisors to work at various locations throughout the country and is expected to employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel. Funding will also support infrastructure construction, security staff, aircraft, and expanded aviation facilities for efficient staff travel. The FY2010 supplemental request included funding for State Department operational costs in Iraq amounting to $1.57 billion to maintain civilian outreach following the military drawdown. Currently, over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies are stationed in Iraq, with logistical and security costs often supported by the military. During the 2007 surge in Iraq, embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams (ePRTs) were established to allow civilian presence in additional locations protected by combat battalions. These civilian federal employees conduct various missions, including diplomatic work, economic assistance, rule of law programs, and training with Iraqi ministry and local government personnel. The embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams (ePRTs) were established during the 2007 surge in Iraq to support government assistance programs, reconstruction efforts, rule of law programs, and training with Iraqi ministry and local government personnel. As combat battalions withdraw, PRTs are being phased out, with plans to establish two consulates, three Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs), and two interim Defense Department PRTs by 2011. Additional funding is allocated for infrastructure realignment to support this transition. The supplemental funding request through the end of 2011 includes realigning infrastructure for the transition to an Embassy, two consulates, three State managed PDTs, and two interim Defense Department PRTs. Costs previously covered by the military, such as utilities, housing, and security, will now be assumed by the State Department. Additionally, funding will go towards developing planned consulate facilities to meet security standards. The Department of State is transitioning responsibilities from the Department of Defense for housing, protecting, and maintaining staff. This includes large increases in contract employees for security, operations planning, maintenance, and food preparation. Criticisms have been made in the past regarding the Department's lack of personnel to oversee contracts and their implementation. It is unclear if the Department is adequately prepared for the growing responsibilities in Iraq. The Department of State has faced criticism for lacking personnel to oversee contracts in Iraq. H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than requested. P.L. 111-212 cuts $540 million from diplomatic operations, affecting site development for consulates in Basrah and northern Iraq. The Senate appropriators suggested prioritizing the construction of permanent consulates in Basrah and northern Iraq within the available funds. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increased the Administration's request for INCLE by $133 million, reconfiguring the funds for police training and adding $200 million for implementation and security. This funding is contingent on the Iraqi Government's support and cooperation with the programs. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan focused on specific infrastructure needs to show continued U.S. support and enhance the perception of the Pakistan government's ability to address insurgency and extremist ideologies. Funding for Pakistan showed only a modest shift between FY2009 and FY2011, with the supplemental request not indicating a significant change in U.S. policy compared to Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan aimed at infrastructure needs to support the government and counter insurgency.

An additional $600 million was requested for border security due to security concerns, with no funding requested to prevent layoffs of teachers, law enforcement officers, and firefighters. The Administration did not request additional funding for various sectors like teachers, law enforcement, and firefighters. The House's amended bill included funding for these areas, but it was not included in the final version of the enacted bill. Funding for these proposals may be included in other bills. Funding for teachers, law enforcement officials, and firefighters was not included in the final version of H.R. 4899, but may be included in other bills. The Senate passed an amendment to provide $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and increase federal Medicaid reimbursements to free up additional funds for states. The House plans to consider this bill after recess. The House plans to return from recess the week of August 8 to consider a bill that does not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs, but a budget request for funds was not made. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs as it was not included in the Senate version passed on July 27. The House withdrew its support for the Education Jobs Fund that would save or create 140,000 education jobs during the 2010-2011 school year. The House amended version included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund, but withdrew support on July 27, 2010. The proposed offsets triggered a veto threat from the Administration, arguing that the cuts would damage school reform efforts. A survey estimated that about 275,000 teachers and school staff could be affected. According to the American Association of School Administrators, an estimated 275,000 teachers and school staff could be laid off in the 2010-2011 school year without additional funding. This could lead to an increase in pupil-to-teacher ratios. The Education Jobs Fund proposed to distribute funds to state governors to prevent layoffs, similar to the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The Education Jobs Fund proposed distributing funds to state governors based on a population-based formula used for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. Funds were used to prevent teacher layoffs, with a requirement for the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funds within 45 days of enactment. States had to meet maintenance of effort requirements to receive funds, with additional requirements for Texas. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funding for hiring programs under the COPS Office. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, which was not requested by the Administration. The proposed $1.179 billion for the COPS hiring program was dropped from the House-amended version approved on July 1, and later receded from by the House on July 27, 2010. This funding would have helped law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls to hire or retain officers, but may only provide a temporary solution. If tax revenues do not rebound, states may need to lay off officers again. The proposed $1.179 billion for the COPS hiring program was dropped from the final version of H.R. 4899, which did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention. The earlier draft suggested $500 million for the SAFER program, but this was not included in the enacted version. The House July-amended version of the Department of Homeland Security's SAFER program did not provide funds for hiring new firefighters or maintaining current staffing levels. Proponents argue for an additional $500 million for SAFER due to budget shortfalls at the state and local level, while opponents believe the current funding is sufficient given the need to reduce federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program due to high demand for government loans since 2008. Regular appropriations for the rural housing program were depleted by May 2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. This responds to high demand for government loans since 2008, with banks making credit less available. Regular appropriations for the rural housing program were depleted by May 2010, leading to the need for supplemental funds to prevent otherwise qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers going unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version offsets $50 million within agriculture by limiting outlays from a mandatory bioenergy program. Additionally, the fees for receiving loan guarantees are raised, and $697 million of loan guarantee authority is added for Section 502 rural housing loans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. This is in addition to the $12 billion in guaranteed loans and $1.1 billion in direct loans available from regular FY2010 appropriations. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for $1.2 billion of direct loans under Section 502 for FY2011, along with a new fee structure for $12 billion of loan guarantees at no cost to the government. The final version also provides $151 million for $4.7 billion of farm loans in FY2011. The Agriculture Department is requesting $151 million for FY2011 to support $4.7 billion of farm loans. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and $979 million from various Agriculture Department accounts. This includes $487 million from reserve funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), $422 million from rural development, and $70 million from unobligated balances from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The FY2010 supplemental funding did not include money for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program, but the Administration's FY2011 request is pending. The Administration aimed to accelerate private sector investment in clean energy projects and move forward with three nuclear power plant projects. The Office of Management and Budget planned to reduce DOE's FY2011 LGP request by $180 million included in the House's July-amended version. The House's July-amended version included $180 million for the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to support energy technology projects, with $90 million for nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy projects. This funding could support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. The DOE requested additional loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects and credit subsidy costs for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Established in 2005, the program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and received funding in FY2009 through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The DOE Loan Guarantee Program, established in 2005, received funding in FY2009 through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act to support energy technology projects. The program aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and had funding appropriated for commercial renewable energy projects. In FY2011, $2 billion was re-programmed to support the Cash-for-Clunkers program, with efforts to restore funding to the Loan Guarantee Program. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include additional funds for the Federal Pell Grant Program as proposed in the House's July-amended version. The House Appropriations Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program to close a funding gap. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include the additional funds but provides the $4,860 discretionary maximum award level in AY2011-12. The Pell Grant Program funding was not increased by the Senate Appropriations Committee, but the discretionary maximum award level of $4,860 for AY2011-12 was maintained. The program, authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, provides need-based grant aid to around 8.3 million undergraduate students. Funding for the program comes from both discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with a recent budget amendment requesting additional funds for border security. The Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security along the Southwest Border of the United States, with $399 million for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and $201 million for the Department of Justice (DOJ). The funding includes hiring 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, two new unmanned aerial detection systems, 160 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, 30 new Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers, and 20 new CBP canine teams to improve border enforcement operations. The $201 million of DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest border districts by adding seven Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Gunrunner Teams, five FBI Hybrid Task Forces, additional Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents, equipment, operational support, and additional attorneys and immigration judges to support detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens in coordination with DHS enforcement activities. Funding would also support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic analysis, DNA analysis, information sharing, technical capabilities, and technical assistance. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 did not include funding for border security, but H.R. 5875 passed with $701 million for this purpose. Both the Administration and H.R. 5875 allocated $201 million to DOJ for border security efforts, including more law enforcement personnel. Additionally, funding would support Mexican law enforcement operations with various technical capabilities. The Administration requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. They also proposed a mandatory funding provision to increase the U.S. Coast Guard's access to funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust fund for response activities, which was enacted separately in P.L. 111-191. The Administration requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This included funding for an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program, additional inspections by the Department of the Interior, and economic impact mitigation by NOAA for fishermen and fishery-related businesses affected by the spill. $13 million for NOAA to mitigate economic impact on fishermen and fishery-related businesses affected by the oil spill; $10 million for the Department of Justice for enforcement actions under the Oil Pollution Act and Clean Water Act; $7 million for NOAA for research in support of the oil spill response; $5 million for Economic Development Administration for economic assistance in affected areas; $2 million for EPA to study long-term impacts of the oil spill. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves a total of $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including economic assistance grants to state and local governments, EPA study on long-term impacts of the oil spill, FDA funding for seafood inspection technologies, and additional funding for NOAA for fisheries disaster relief and ecosystem study in the Gulf. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $26 million for NOAA for fisheries disaster relief, an expanded stock assessment of Gulf fisheries, and a study on the long-term effects on the ecosystem. Additionally, it provides authority for the Army Corps of Engineers to use discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. The bill allocates a portion of discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. It also includes additional mandatory spending for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, the Cobell case, the Pigford II case, and funding for the Coast Guard's response activities. The bill includes additional mandatory funding for veterans exposed to hazardous substances like Agent Orange, which would not be subject to budget procedural constraints. The Administration also proposed categorizing additional funding for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as emergency funding, exempt from PAYGO rules. Spending for two court settlements requires new legislative authority and funds. The Administration proposed additional mandatory funding for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as emergency funding exempt from PAYGO rules. Spending for court settlements requires new legislative authority and funds, subject to budget enforcement rules. The Secretary of the VA has authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. The Secretary of the VA announced a presumption of service connection for Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia for veterans exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam. The estimated cost for these new presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010. Approximately 86,000 veterans are eligible for retroactive benefits, increased disability ratings, or new disability compensation. The VA announced new presumptions for veterans exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia. The estimated cost for these presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010. Veterans may be eligible for retroactive benefits, increased disability ratings, or new disability compensation. The VA Secretary has the authority to compensate veterans once regulations are issued, with CBO estimating $5 billion needed in FY2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $13.4 billion for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. The differences in cost estimates between CBO and OMB for FY2010 are due to uncertainty about when final regulations will be released. Section 902 prohibits the VA from paying claims related to Agent Orange until the Congressional review period has expired. The Senate adopted Section 902 of H.R. 4899, prohibiting the VA from paying Agent Orange claims until Congressional review period ends. The Administration requested $4.6 billion for settlements in discrimination cases. The claimants in the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement and Pigford II discrimination case argue that without timely funds appropriation, settlements could be voided. The most recent deadline for the Cobell case is August 6, 2010, with multiple extensions. The Pigford II settlement, announced in February 2010, requested $1.15 billion in emergency appropriation, but funds were not allocated. The Pigford II settlement requested $1.15 billion in funds, but no appropriation was made by the deadline. The settlement is final and non-appealable, with a provision allowing claimants to void it if funds are not allocated. The Administration also requested $3.4 billion for the Cobell v. Salazar case, with $1.4 billion for plaintiffs and $2 billion for account consolidation. The Cobell v. Salazar case settlement involves $1.4 billion for plaintiffs, $2 billion for land consolidation, and $60 million for education scholarships. The lawsuit arose from mismanagement of Indian trust fund accounts by the Interior Department. Legislative authorization is required by August 6, 2010, with the deadline extended multiple times. The Cobell lawsuit stemmed from Interior's mismanagement of Individual Indian Monies trust accounts, leading to a contentious legal battle lasting 14 years. The settlement aims to resolve the dispute, with some Indian organizations and plaintiffs supporting it while others oppose it. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlement. The Cobell lawsuit resulted from Interior's mismanagement of Indian trust accounts, leading to a 14-year legal battle. Some support the settlement, while others oppose it. H.R. 4899 does not include the $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlement, causing disagreement among Indian organizations and plaintiffs. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions for funding the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements, causing disagreement among Indian organizations and plaintiffs. Senator Reid's office may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill with offsets or savings in mandatory programs required under PAYGO provisions. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions for funding the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements. Savings in mandatory programs would be required under PAYGO provisions, but the earlier House July amended version with $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years was not included. Two new provisions intended to reduce government medical care expenditures were also left out. The July 1 amended House version of the supplemental appropriations act aimed to amend Medicaid law by including injected, infused, and inhaled dosage forms of outpatient drugs in determining AMP, a benchmark price for calculating rebates. This proposal was not included in the final version of H.R. 4899 or in the Administration request. The House proposed amending Medicaid law to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the AMP calculation for Medicaid rebates. This change was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years, but the Senate did not accept this provision. The Senate did not accept the provisions to add additional drug forms to the definition of AMP that was included in the House amended version. Sections 4201-4206 of the House July amended version of H.R. 4899 form the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, aiming to stop pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry uses pay-to-delay arrangements, where a patent holder pays a generic manufacturer to delay the entry of a generic drug into the market. This practice was not included in the enacted health reform bills, despite being addressed in previous legislation like the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984. The FDA approved a generic drug after the patent expired, reducing costs for consumers. Delays in generic availability increase costs for the government. Proposed provisions aim to make agreements delaying generic drug production unlawful. The proposed provisions aim to make agreements delaying generic drug production unlawful, with the FTC Act adding a new section 28. This would reduce federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over the 2010-2020 period, according to CBO estimates. The Senate did not accept these provisions, and the enacted version did not include funding for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. The enacted version of the bill did not include $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. This funding was intended for various government agencies to prevent improper payments and investigate illegal activities. Federal agencies conduct Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (WFA) activities to ensure appropriate federal expenditures and beneficiary entitlements. The $538 million in WFA funding was allocated for enhanced tax enforcement by IRS, HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, HHS Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice, and SSA for continuing disability reviews of Social Security Disability Insurance. The $538 million in funding allocated for Waste, Fraud, and Abuse activities includes support for HHS, DOJ, SSA, and DOL for various investigations and reviews. The funds are available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated that this funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The Administration proposed expanding funds for the Coast Guard from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance response activities and setting up a new unemployment assistance program. The Trust Fund allows the Coast Guard to withdraw up to $150 million per year, supported by an excise tax on petroleum. The additional funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The Administration proposed using funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance Coast Guard response activities and establish a new unemployment assistance program. The Trust Fund allows up to $150 million per year in withdrawals, supported by an excise tax on petroleum. The proposal includes a 1 cent increase in the tax per barrel of oil to replenish the fund. The Administration's proposal authorized mandatory appropriations as \"advances\" from the trust fund to cover costs of the benefit and its administration. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory appropriations, with $150 million in spending offset by $25 million recovered from responsible parties under the liability provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Coast Guard could make advances of $100 million each from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, exceeding the $150 million annual limitation on fund withdrawals. The Administration's proposal would increase the cap on advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1.5 billion for responding to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available by the end of FY2010. The proposed increase in the limitation on annual advances would apply exclusively to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The proposed increase in the limitation on annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1.575 billion by the end of FY2010 would apply exclusively to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress within 7 days for advances related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, while the advance for other spills would still require 30 days notice. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Trust Fund similar to legislation passed separately in response to concerns raised by Admiral Thad Allen and the Department of Homeland Security. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was increased to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill in response to concerns raised by Admiral Thad Allen and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. The legislation allowed $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress and was enacted on June 15th, 2010. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010, offset by reimbursements in FY2012, without violating PAYGO rules. The actual amount available to the Coast Guard would depend on the number of $100 million advances drawn from the trust fund, up to the $1 billion cap. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the Administration's proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program, which CBO estimated would cost $33 million. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.7 billion in spending. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, with a total spending request of $64.3 billion for disaster relief, war funding, foreign assistance, and other programs. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, with a total spending request of $64.3 billion for disaster relief, war funding, foreign assistance, and other programs. The bill included funding for Haiti relief, Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, disaster relief, foreign assistance, oil spill recovery, Education Jobs Fund, Pell Grants, summer youth employment, and court cases. The final version adopted by the House on July 27, 2010, totaled $81.8 billion in spending.

The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with a spending request of $64.3 billion for various programs. The final version adopted by the House totaled $81.8 billion in spending. The Senate version included funding for FEMA, war-related activities, Haiti relief, Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, and benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Additional funding was allocated for U.S. disaster relief programs and foreign aid. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 added funding for U.S. disaster relief programs, foreign aid, and humanitarian assistance, totaling $59.3 billion. This amount was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request, with $300 million in rescissions. The Senate debated the bill from May 25-May 27, 2010, focusing on various proposed amendments. The Senate debated H.R. 4899 from May 25-May 27, 2010, focusing on amendments related to border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, national disasters funding, and Afghanistan withdrawal. Majority Leader Senator Reid proposed considering and voting on six amendments with strict time limits, followed by a cloture motion vote. Senators Kyl and McCain suggested additional funding for 6,000 National Guard and other personnel for border security. The Senate rejected the six proposed amendments. The Senate debated amendments related to border security, Gulf oil spill response, and federal funding. Senators proposed measures for relief to small businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and funding for additional National Guard deployment. Some senators suggested cutting federal funding to offset the deficit spending. Amendments were proposed to cut federal funding by $59 billion to offset deficit spending. Senator Inouye questioned the feasibility of these proposals. Six individual amendments were rejected, including McCain's amendment for $250 million for National Guards at the southern border and Kyl's amendment for $200 million to prevent illegal crossings at the southwest border. Several amendments were proposed, including Kyl's $200 million amendment to prevent illegal crossings at the southwest border, Cornyn's amendment to deploy National Guards, Feingold's amendment for troop redeployment from Afghanistan, and Coburn's $59 billion cut in the supplemental bill over 10 years. After considering various amendments, including troop redeployment from Afghanistan and a $59 billion cut in the supplemental bill over 10 years, the Senate invoked cloture and passed H.R. 4899 with amendments by a vote of 67 to 28. The Senate invoked cloture on H.R. 4899 by a vote of 69 to 20 on May 27, 2010. Later that day, the Senate adopted 16 amendments in a Managers' amendment and passed the bill by a vote of 67 to 28. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2010, adding $22.5 billion in funding for domestic programs and $16.3 billion in rescissions and mandatory savings. The House adopted a rule on July 1, 2010, setting procedures for H.R. 4899 and approving amendments. The rule also included funding for court cases, a summer jobs program, and changed transportation grant formulas and tax provisions. The House passed House Amendment No. 2 on July 1, 2010, which included additional funding for domestic programs not in the Senate bill. Republican members argued for confining spending to FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and settling court cases, while Democratic members justified the additional domestic spending. The House passed additional funding for domestic programs on July 1, 2010, including $10.0 billion for Education Job. Republican members argued for limited spending on FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and settling court cases, while Democratic members justified additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs and provide government-sponsored credit for various projects. Debate also focused on the Administration's policy in Afghanistan and the President's plan to withdraw troops in July 2011. The House passed additional funding on July 1, 2010, including $10.0 billion for Education Job Funds, $5.0 billion for Pell Grants, and other allocations for border security, Medicare, alternative energy, and oil spill recovery. The House also included $2.5 billion for non-defense DOD. The House July-amended version of the bill included $67 million for agricultural and farm loans, $2.5 billion for non-defense DOD spending, and $12.2 billion in rescissions for offsets. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions for mandatory programs, with $4.5 billion in savings from programs not addressed by the Senate. Rescissions of unobligated authority can offset new spending, with budget authority available for obligation from one to five years. If unobligated authority expires, it reduces the deficit. Controversial rescissions are debated, while others are uncontroversial, especially when the authority is unlikely to be obligated before expiring. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions for various programs, with savings from expiring funds and unobligated authority. Controversial rescissions are debated, while others are uncontroversial, especially when the authority is unlikely to be obligated before expiring. The House considered a bill with $748 million in unused disaster assistance funding, $220 million in State Department funding, and $1.8 billion from other programs. The Administration issued a veto threat, citing concerns about undermining the President's abilities as Commander-in-Chief and cuts to education initiatives. Three amendments related to war funding in Afghanistan were rejected, including one to delete all DOD war funding. Three war-related amendments related to funding in Afghanistan were rejected by the House. The first would have deleted all DOD war funding, the second aimed to restrict funding for protection and withdrawal of personnel, and the third required funds to align with the President's policy for troop withdrawal by July 1, 2011. Additional measures included a withdrawal plan submission, a new intelligence estimate, and increased oversight of contractors in Afghanistan. The House rejected an amendment that required the President to submit a withdrawal plan for Afghanistan by April 4, 2011, conduct a new intelligence estimate, and report on oversight of contractors. The amendment failed by a vote of 162 to 260. Earlier proposals to add funding for the COPS program and Firefighter Assistance grants were removed before floor action."
