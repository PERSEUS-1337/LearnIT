    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, initially under the Army-Navy Petroleum Board before becoming part of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in 1962. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) was established in 1964 to manage the Department of Defense's petroleum products and coal procurement. In 1998, it was re-designated with an expanded mission to manage a variety of energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery, including bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, refueling at commercial airports, and post-camp-and-station fuel. The report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD expenditures, prices to commercial equivalents, and quantities to U.S. refined petroleum production. It also discusses refining, refineries supplying jet fuel, DESC's procurement practices, and recent legislation affecting fuel procurement. The report discusses DOD's fuel procurement practices, recent legislation directing the consideration of alternative fuels, and the stimulation of commercial interest in supplying fuel needs. High fuel prices have prompted interest in producing alternative fuels, but no commercial projects have been established yet. Legislation now aims to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming, with proposed rules on greenhouse gas emission reporting potentially having minimal impact. The majority of DESC's bulk fuel purchases are for JP-8 jet fuel, ranging from 60 to 74 million barrels annually over the past decade. The Air Force and Army are the primary consumers of JP-8 fuel, while the Navy consumes JP-5 jet fuel. All services consume diesel fuel to varying degrees. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 purchases peaking in FY2004. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% increase. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% over the same time period. DESC's petroleum product purchases, summarized by volume and total cost, do not necessarily correspond with DOD's actual consumption. DOD may draw fuel down from storage to supplement demand and may replenish fuel stores with purchases. Fuel costs and average prices continued to rise, driven by increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of all petroleum products purchased rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. The average cost of petroleum products purchased by DESC increased from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, a 370% increase. Jet fuel prices reversed their price advantage over commercial aviation fuel after 9/11 and the Iraq invasion. The margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices also increased significantly during this period. DOD responded by purchasing alternate jet fuels when offered at lower prices than military specification fuel. DESC increased purchases of alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel to offset decreasing JP-8 purchases. Total defense outlays increased by 200% from FY2000 to FY2007, representing actual spending by DOD. Total defense outlays increased by 200% from FY2000 to FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497% during this period, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, relying on imports from countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. Refineries previously had steady access to light sweet crude oil when U.S. production was higher. Refineries in the United States previously relied on steady supplies of light sweet crude oil, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), for their operations. However, with the diminishing supply of sweet crudes, refineries have increasingly turned to heavier sour crudes. Crude oil contains natural components that separate out into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel during the refining process. Many refineries now process the residuum that remains after atmospheric distillation into gasoline and middle distillate range products. Refineries process crude oil into various products like gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel. They use atmospheric distillation to separate the components, with some refineries further refining the residuum into different products using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Different grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour, require specific refining processes. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process, while sour crudes need desulfurization. Specifications for jet fuel, especially military grade, are more stringent than for kerosene. Refineries can be set up in different configurations for processing crude oil. Topping refineries use atmospheric distillation to separate crude oil into products like naphtha. Hydroskimming refineries are more complex, running light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add processes like catalytic cracking to run light sour crude for distillates. Coking refineries are high conversion refineries that use coking processes to run medium/sour crude. Coking refineries are high conversion refineries that use coking processes to run medium/sour crude oil. Refinery complexity is measured using the Nelson Complexity Index, which rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity. The Nelson Complexity Index rates refinery complexity based on secondary processes. U.S. refineries have an average index of 10, with only 59 having coking capacity. Gulf Coast refineries yield jet fuel and diesel, with some upgrading processes to handle heavier crude oils and meet EPA sulfur regulations. Some refineries are upgrading processes to handle heavier sour crude oils and meet EPA sulfur regulations by producing ultra-low sulfur diesel. Refiners are faced with the challenge of limiting sulfur picked up during pipeline transit or reprocessing contaminated \"transmix.\" The U.S. Army has adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, using JP-8 for land-based equipment to minimize the fuel supply chain length in theaters of operation. Diesel fuel quality, especially sulfur content, varies globally, exposing vehicles to elevated sulfur levels. The U.S. Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8 to minimize the fuel supply chain length in theaters of operation. The sulfur content of JP-8 is limited to 3,000 ppm by ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E, with a typical content of 140 ppm. Tactical vehicles may need to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel in the U.S. for readiness, but EPA has not indicated reducing sulfur content in jet fuel. EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Army relies on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel for readiness in the United States. EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and recently proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases from petroleum refineries. The EPA proposed a rule for Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases from petroleum refineries, aiming to require reporting of emissions and potentially cap emissions in the future through legislation like H.R. 2454. The House passed legislation in 2009 to amend the Clean Air Act, establishing a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The bill would cap emissions from refineries and allow trading of emissions permits. H.R. 2454 would gradually reduce the cap to 83%, requiring industries to cut emissions or purchase allowances from others. Currently, there are 142 refineries in the US, with top suppliers including Shell, Valero, ExxonMobil, and BP. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation, operating 31 refineries in the United States with nearly 6 million barrels per day of crude capacity. The number of US refineries decreased from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, but atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141, but the atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The increase in capacity is partly due to higher diesel fuel capacity, now at 3.5 million bpd. Refineries above the median capacity of 80,000 bpd make up 85% of the overall U.S. refining capacity. Gulf Coast refineries can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of the U.S. net production of jet fuel, making up less than 1% of all U.S. refined petroleum products. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded the U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years, with U.S. refineries sometimes supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases. This indicates that the current capacity of U.S. refineries does not meet all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. DESC has increased its purchase of commercial jet fuels, such as Jet A, to make up for the lack of U.S. refining capacity meeting DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending on fuel as commercial jet fuel is priced lower. To ensure closer refineries supply the fuel, DESC also makes purchases through contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces and installations outside the continental United States. Logistics demand that closer refineries supply fuel, with DESC balancing purchases through contracts with foreign suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. DOD's authority to procure fuel stems from the Navy, now relying on general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304. DESC now relies on general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel for the armed forces. Contracts are awarded and fuel is purchased in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund. This allows for price breaks on large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for DOD customers throughout the fiscal year. The acquisition process for federal agencies is defined by Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403, involving the procurement of property or services to support agency missions. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs military procurement laws, while the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR outlines federal agency acquisition regulations. The FAR System does not include internal agency guidance. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses. This allows for upward and downward revision of contract prices based on specified contingencies, following regulations outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS). Economic price adjustment provisions are used when future costs are unpredictable, especially for refined petroleum products. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for refined petroleum products. They have adopted instructions for multi-year contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, and more. DOD can enter initial five-year contracts with options for renewals up to twenty years. Initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922 may include options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. A \"multiyear contract\" involves purchasing supplies or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years, with performance in subsequent years contingent on fund appropriation. This type of contract differs from a multiple year contract in that it covers more than one year's requirement without the need for individual options for each program year after the first. Multiyear contracts allow for the purchase of supplies or services for multiple years without the need for individual options each year, promoting national security and resulting in cost savings. The Department of Defense (DOD) can enter into multiyear contracts for supplies to achieve cost savings and promote national security. These contracts must be canceled if Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years. Multiyear contracting is encouraged to lower costs and meet other objectives. The contract cannot exceed $500 million without approval from the Secretary of Defense and reporting to congressional defense committees. The Department of Defense (DOD) is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including through multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has broad waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels, allowing for flexibility in contracts based on market conditions. The Secretary of Defense may waive contract provisions and terms for defined fuel sources like petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke based on market conditions. The waiver authority could include lifting the five-year limit on multi-year contracts, but DESC has not decided if they would exercise this authority to avoid risking delegation or sales. DESC is unsure about waiving statutory limits on multiyear contracts, as it's unclear if DDO or Congress would agree. They don't want to risk losing sales authority granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e. DESC bases contract delivery price on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, redistributing fuel to bases. They level fuel prices for all DOD customers, including a surcharge for operating costs. Additional costs may be incurred by operational commands for tactical fuel delivery. In the past, hidden costs in fuel delivery were not considered by DOD. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider fuel logistics costs, including hidden costs like air-to-air refueling and ground transport. New military capabilities must now factor in the fully burdened cost of fuel in their life-cycle cost analysis. The act also mandates the appointment of a director responsible for overseeing the energy required for military operations. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 mandates the appointment of a director responsible for overseeing the energy required for military operations. The act also addresses the significant increase in fuel costs for the Department of Defense, impacting training and operations due to rising fuel prices. Fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD's spending, affecting the Operation and Maintenance budget. The Department of Defense (DOD) has faced significant increases in fuel costs, impacting its budget and operations. Unlike the airline industry, DOD's options to mitigate these costs are limited, relying on supplemental appropriations. DOD has explored strategies like fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels to reduce its vulnerability to price fluctuations and supply shortages. Increasing purchases of commercial Jet A fuel have helped lower DOD's fuel expenses. DESC has implemented strategies such as fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels to reduce vulnerability to price fluctuations and supply shortages. Purchases of commercial Jet A fuel have lowered fuel costs and expanded supply options. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to mitigate risks associated with fuel price swings. DESC uses various strategies to manage fuel price fluctuations, including hedging and fixed-price contracts with economic adjustment clauses. The airline industry also employs hedging strategies to minimize the risk of future fuel price increases. Southwest Airlines, for example, managed to hedge its fuel at a lower price when crude oil prices peaked in 2008. Additionally, the Defense Business Board has explored ways to reduce the Department of Defense's exposure to fuel price volatility through hedging in commercial markets. Southwest Airlines hedged fuel at $51/barrel in 2008. The Defense Business Board considered hedging DOD's fuel purchases in commercial markets or through the Interior Department's Mineral Management Service. Interior's OCS lease revenues could offset DOD fuel costs during oil price spikes. OMB could transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on price changes. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) seeks legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on unanticipated price changes. Interior's revenues mainly come from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, with royalties-in-kind paid by OCS lessees in the form of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR was created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions, holding roughly 70 days of imported supply when filled to capacity. A drawdown of the SPR under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can involve a sale to the highest bidder or an exchange. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) holds roughly 70 days of imported supply when filled to capacity. A drawdown under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can involve a sale to the highest bidder or an exchange. In 2006, 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR, causing potential supply disruptions for vulnerable refineries. Refining throughput could decrease by 735,000 barrels per day if certain refineries are affected. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) holds 70 days of imported supply at capacity. However, 36 vulnerable refineries may face supply disruptions as their operations are not fully compatible with the types of oil stored in the SPR. This could lead to a 5% decrease in U.S. refining throughput, affecting the SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption. The SPR's role in mitigating a DOD fuel supply disruption is not clearly defined, as refineries may have limitations in producing jet fuel, which is crucial for DOD requirements. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) holds 70 days of imported supply at capacity, but 36 vulnerable refineries may face disruptions due to operational limitations in producing jet fuel. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless they meet specific emissions criteria to prevent exacerbating global warming. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels that worsen global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant but is interested in synthetic fuels for DOD JP-8 requirements in Alaska. Despite declining crude oil prices, supply shortages and price spikes may recur. DOD is focusing on efficiency and may report on the full cost of fuel for military operations. The DOD is shifting towards efficiency due to policy and economic constraints on fossil-based alternatives. Congress may be concerned about the refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during periods of high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits in response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps. Congress may also worry about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel suppliers in the long term. Some operators of marginally profitable refineries may consider shutting down, raising concerns in Congress about potential impacts on defense fuel suppliers. Background information on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation is available in CRS reports. Avgas is high octane fuel for light aircraft, while DFM and DF2 are used in shipboard propulsion and ground vehicles, respectively. Jet A-1 is a type of fuel used in light aircraft powered by reciprocating spark-ignition engines. DFM (diesel fuel marine) is used in shipboard propulsion plants, while DF2 is the primary fuel for ground mobility vehicles. FSII is a fuel additive, and FOB is a trade term for delivery of goods on board a vessel. Contracts for international transportation often include trade terms specifying delivery, payment, risk transfer, and cost responsibilities. Jet A-1 is a kerosene-based turbine fuel used in international commercial aviation, with ASTM specification D1655 and NATO designation F-35. Jet A is a similar fuel with a higher freeze point, while Jet B is a distillate blend of naphtha and kerosene. Jet B is a distillate fuel with higher flammability than Jet A-1, mainly used in very cold climates for better cold weather performance. JP-4 and JP-5 are military equivalents of Jet B with additional additives, meeting specific military and British specifications. JP-4 and JP-5 are military fuels meeting specific military and British specifications. JP-5 is kerosene-based with a higher flash-point for aircraft carriers, while JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with added inhibitors for safety. The Air Force switched to JP-8 in 1996 for safety and combat survivability concerns. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with corrosion and icing inhibitors. The Air Force switched to JP-8 in 1996 for safety reasons. It is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, with lower levels of benzene and n-hexane. JP-8 has a stronger smell and is oily to the touch, while JP-4 is more solvent-like. JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Middle Distillate range fuels like kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel are used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements over up to five years. Multiyear contracting allows for acquiring known requirements over up to five years, even if full funds are not available at the time of contract award. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used in gasoline production for catalytic reforming."
