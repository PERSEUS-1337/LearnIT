    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution. Concerns exist about enforcement adequacy and environmental impacts, especially in the cruise industry. The cruise industry, representing 13% of the world shipping fleet, is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, generating $40 billion in benefits and 357,000 jobs in 2009. With a fleet of over 230 ships, the industry has seen a 7.4% annual growth in passengers since 1990, hosting 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The environmental impacts of cruise activities have raised concerns despite its economic contributions. The worldwide cruise industry has seen significant growth since 1990, with an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. In 2010, cruises hosted 14.3 million passengers on over 230 ships, majority of which are foreign-flagged. The industry continues to add larger, more luxurious ships, with the average ship size increasing every five years. Safety and health concerns are key issues for the industry. The cruise ship industry faces safety and health concerns due to the large volume of waste generated on board. A typical one-week voyage on a large cruise ship with 3,000 passengers and crew can produce 210,000 gallons of sewage, 1 million gallons of graywater, 130 gallons of hazardous waste, 8 tons of solid waste, and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Proper treatment and disposal of these wastes are essential to prevent risks to human health and the environment. The cruise ship industry generates a large volume of waste, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water. Improper disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of laws for managing these wastes, with weak enforcement noted. Foreign-flag cruise ships have been involved in numerous illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, as highlighted in a 2000 General Accounting Office report. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, finding that 83% involved oil or oil-based products. 72% of the discharges were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships. In 2000, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address pollution by cruise ships, leading to investigations and recommendations for waste management. EPA released a cruise ship discharge assessment in December 2008. In 2000, EPA issued a background document with recommendations for further assessment of cruise ship pollution. In December 2008, the agency released a report summarizing waste streams and findings from data collection activities, especially in Alaskan waters. The report also identified options to address ship discharges and discussed the various types of waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships. International and domestic laws address pollution from cruise ships, with some wastes covered by international standards and others by U.S. law. The report discusses the various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships, highlighting the complex body of international and domestic laws addressing pollution from cruise ships. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to improve environmental operations, while environmental groups have called for stricter regulation of cruise ship wastes. Environmental groups have petitioned the federal government for stricter regulation of cruise ship wastes, endorsing legislation for stricter standards to control wastewater and other discharges. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can harm the marine environment if not properly treated and disposed of. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can harm the marine environment if not properly treated and disposed of. These wastes, including sewage, graywater, and solid waste, pose a threat to human health and aquatic life. While cruise ships represent a small portion of the international shipping industry, their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas make their waste discharges a significant concern. Cruise ships concentrate activities in specific coastal areas, posing a significant concern due to the large volumes of wastes they produce. Blackwater, sewage from toilets and medical facilities, contains harmful bacteria, viruses, and nutrients that can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, risking public health. Nutrients in sewage promote excessive algal growth, leading to oxygen depletion in water and potential fish kills. Sewage and graywater from cruise ships can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage promote algal growth, leading to oxygen depletion in water and potential harm to aquatic life. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater containing various pollutants. EPA and Alaska state sampling found untreated graywater from cruise ships can contain harmful pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria. Untreated graywater from cruise ships contains pollutants such as oil, grease, metals, organics, and petroleum hydrocarbons. It can also have high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, exceeding those in untreated domestic wastewater. Graywater is a major source of liquid waste on cruise ships, with potential environmental impacts due to nutrient concentrations. Solid waste on ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics. Graywater is the largest source of liquid waste on cruise ships, containing pollutants and high levels of fecal coliform bacteria. Solid waste includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can become marine debris and harm marine life. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board, with the ash often discharged at sea. This waste poses a threat to marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries utilizing marine waters. Cruise ships generate a significant amount of solid waste, with each passenger producing two pounds of non-hazardous waste per day. Large cruise ships can generate up to 8 tons of solid waste during a one-week cruise, contributing to 24% of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide. Most of the waste is treated on board, but some is discharged at sea, posing a threat to marine life. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from various onboard activities, including photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and chemicals, posing a strain on port reception facilities. Hazardous waste generated on cruise ships, such as paints, thinners, and various chemicals, can be toxic to marine organisms if not managed carefully. Oil leaks from engine spaces mix with bilge water, posing threats to wildlife and human health. The hull of a ship can release harmful substances like oil, gasoline, and byproducts from petroleum breakdown, posing risks to marine life and human health. Bilge water may contain pollutants, solid wastes, and chemicals like detergents and degreasers, which can be toxic to marine organisms if discharged. Large vessels generate significant amounts of oily bilge water, with cruise ships producing an average of eight metric tons per day. Large cruise ships generate significant amounts of oily bilge water, which needs to be extracted and treated before discharge to prevent oil pollution. If the separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated bilge water can harm marine life when discharged into the ocean. EPA states that bilge water is a common source of oil pollution from cruise ships, leading to environmental charges against some cruise lines. Cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers use ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport. This water is essential for compensating changes in weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded. However, ballast water discharge can lead to environmental issues if not properly managed. Ballast water discharge from ships, especially cargo ships, is crucial for stabilizing the vessel's weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded. However, this discharge often contains various biological materials, including non-native species that can harm aquatic ecosystems. It is believed to be the primary source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, leading to public health, environmental, and economic risks for industries like water utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. The economic cost of introducing pest mollusks alone to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is significant. The economic cost of introducing pest mollusks to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is about $2.2 billion per year. Cruise ships contribute to the introduction of non-native species, and their diesel engines generate air pollution classified as a likely human carcinogen by the EPA. Further study is needed to determine the extent of the issue. Diesel exhaust from marine engines contains harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen. Ocean-going vessels contribute significantly to air pollution, including nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions. International shipping is a major source of greenhouse gas pollutants. Ships, including marine diesel engines, emit pollutants such as carbon dioxide, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides, contributing to climate change. International shipping is estimated to have contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. States and localities are increasingly concerned about the impact of commercial marine vessels on regional air quality, especially when docked in ports. Cruise ship emissions, although a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, may still have significant environmental effects. Cruise ship emissions, although a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, may still have significant environmental effects. Shipboard incinerators burn large volumes of waste, producing ash that must be disposed of and may release toxic emissions. Waste streams on cruise ships are governed by various international protocols and U.S. laws, with overlaps, gaps, and differences in jurisdiction. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards through the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL 73/78. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to its requirements, with member nations responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards through the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL 73/78. Vessels subject to MARPOL requirements, regardless of location, must adhere to six Annexes covering various sources of pollution. These Annexes provide an international framework for pollution prevention, including regulations for oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards through the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL 73/78. Annex IV controls pollution of the sea by sewage, Annex V deals with garbage disposal, and Annex VI sets emission limits for marine vessels. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary, and ratification by member countries is required for binding standards. Amendments to the Annexes can be proposed and adopted following specified procedures. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards through the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL 73/78. Annex IV controls pollution of the sea by sewage, Annex V deals with garbage disposal, and Annex VI sets emission limits for marine vessels. Parties that have ratified an Annex may propose amendments, with procedures and timelines specified by MARPOL. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI, but has taken no action regarding Annex IV. The flag state of a ship is responsible for certifying compliance with MARPOL's pollution prevention standards. IMO has established other conventions addressing issues like ballast water management and the International Safety Management Code. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and pledge to comply. The United States implements MARPOL and its annexes through domestic laws, with the most recent action in 2006 ratifying Annex VI to regulate air pollution. Congress approved legislation in 2008 for EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to implement Annex VI standards. Annex VI regulates air pollution under MARPOL, with Congress approving legislation in 2008 for EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to implement the standards. The U.S. participated in international negotiations to strengthen Annex VI, leading to amendments in October 2008. APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard responsible for enforcing regulations. The regulatory mechanism for MARPOL under APPS is separate from other federal environmental laws. The Coast Guard enforces regulations under APPS for MARPOL in U.S. waters. Implementation challenges stem from the international nature of maritime shipping. The U.S. can take enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction. Outside U.S. jurisdiction, cases are referred to flag states according to MARPOL. The United States enforces laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction, referring cases to flag states outside its jurisdiction. Coordination between agencies is required, with the Coast Guard and EPA having regulatory responsibilities, and the Department of Justice prosecuting violations. No single agency coordinates all relevant functions for cruise ships in U.S. waters. The U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and Department of Justice have key regulatory responsibilities for enforcing laws against pollution incidents on foreign-flagged ships. Other federal agencies like NOAA and APHIS also play limited roles in reporting on marine debris and ensuring quarantine inspection of food-contaminated garbage. States and localities may have additional responsibilities. This section outlines U.S. laws and regulations pertaining to cruise ship discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act (CWA), is the main U.S. law regulating pollutant discharges into water bodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program requires permits for pollutant discharges from point sources, including vessels. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from this regulation. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated sewage discharge from vessels within 3 miles of shore. Cruise ships must comply with this regulation, using marine sanitation devices to prevent pollution. EPA sets performance standards for these devices, while the Coast Guard oversees their design and operation. Marine sanitation devices (MSDs) are required on vessels with installed toilets to prevent untreated sewage discharge. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard regulates design and operation. Type II MSDs treat waste before discharge, meeting specific limits, while Type III MSDs store waste for later onshore treatment. Marine sanitation devices (MSDs) on vessels must meet specific discharge limits. Type III MSDs store waste for later treatment onshore, while Type I MSDs disinfect sewage before discharge, with performance standards for fecal coliform bacteria. Regulations for MSDs have not been updated since 1976 and do not require monitoring of effluent discharges, leading to criticism from critics, especially regarding large vessels like cruise ships. The MSD regulations for marine vessels, including cruise ships, have not been updated since 1976. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulatory structure, such as limited coverage of pollutants and lack of monitoring and reporting requirements compared to the NPDES permit program for other sources. The Coast Guard's enforcement of MSD rules has also been criticized for being inadequate. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of MSD rules on cruise ships, with inspectors rarely checking sewage treatment equipment. Factors limiting enforcement include focus on safety, large ship size, limited time and staff for inspections, and lack of surprise in inspections. The Coast Guard's responsibilities include homeland security and non-homeland security tasks. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard has shifted focus to homeland security activities, reducing resources for vessel inspections for MSD and environmental compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks. The requirements apply internationally to cruise ships flagged in ratifying countries, but the United States has not ratified Annex IV, making it optional for ships in U.S. waters. Sewage discharges must be treated within three miles of shore, with specific guidelines for treatment methods based on distance from shore. Within three miles of shore, Annex IV requires sewage to be treated by a certified MSD before discharge. Between three and 12 miles from shore, sewage must be treated by maceration or chlorination; beyond 12 miles, sewage discharges are unrestricted. In U.S. waters, vessels must comply with Clean Water Act regulations. Some cruise ships use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for improved sewage treatment. Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems offer enhanced screening, treatment, disinfection, and sludge processing compared to traditional Type II MSDs. AWTs are effective in removing pathogens, oxygen demanding substances, suspended solids, oil and grease, and particulate metals from sewage. However, they are only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients. No-discharge zones (NDZs) can be established by states to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels with installed toilets within their jurisdiction, up to 3 miles from land. States must apply to the EPA under specific categories to create NDZs for environmental protection. To establish a no-discharge zone (NDZ) for environmental protection, states must apply to the EPA under specific categories. NDZs can be created to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels within state waters up to 3 miles from land. There are three categories for NDZ designation, including one based on the need for greater environmental protection and another for special waters of particular environmental importance. As of 2009, 26 states have designated NDZs, including inland states. The EPA has identified options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within 3 miles from shore, and requiring testing of wastewater treatment equipment. This is part of efforts to protect environmentally sensitive areas like shellfish beds and coral reefs. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant and there are no separate federal effluent standards for graywater discharges. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes, with limits on bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids. Alaska state law requires graywater treatment before discharge. The Clean Water Act regulates graywater discharges on commercial vessels in the Great Lakes, with limits on bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids. Alaska state law also requires graywater treatment before discharge. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries to restrict graywater discharges to protect sensitive ecosystems. EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with restrictions on graywater discharges. NOAA regulations restrict graywater discharges from cruise ships in National Marine Sanctuaries like Monterey Bay and Florida Keys. EPA suggested options for managing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are regulated by the Marine Protection Act. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are governed by the Marine Protection Act, which prohibits dumping garbage into ocean waters without a permit. EPA issues permits for waste disposal at sea, excluding dredged material disposal. Routine effluent discharge for vessel propulsion is exempt from dumping regulations under the Act. The Marine Protection Act governs cruise ship solid waste discharges, exempting routine effluent discharge for vessel propulsion. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also applies, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic anywhere. Coast Guard administers the Act, ensuring port facilities can receive offloaded waste. EPA reports discharges of solid waste and plastic have occurred. The Coast Guard administers the Marine Protection Act in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to ensure port facilities can receive offloaded solid waste from cruise ships. EPA reports discharges of solid waste and plastic, prompting evaluation by the IMO to amend Annex V of MARPOL. Possible options identified by EPA include increasing on-board garbage handling technologies, initiating stronger waste management rules, prohibiting incinerator ash discharge into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and monitoring to prevent solid waste discharge into the marine environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and disposal facilities. Hazardous waste is defined by its ignitability, corrosiveness, reactivity, toxicity, or listing on specific industrial waste streams. Treatment facilities must have permits and comply with regulations. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste, which includes waste that is ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic. Treatment facilities must have permits and comply with regulations. Cruise ships may generate hazardous waste and must adhere to RCRA rules for identification, storage, and disposal of the waste. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes from various activities such as cleaning, painting, and passenger services. These wastes are stored onboard until offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA regulations. It is unclear which specific regulations apply to the management and disposal of these wastes, but RCRA rules for small-quantity generators are less stringent. The management and disposal of hazardous wastes from cruise ships are subject to unclear regulations under RCRA. There is ambiguity in classifying cruise ships as large or small generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less rigorous requirements. A release of hazardous substances could potentially trigger the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires immediate notification of hazardous substance releases from vessels to the National Response Center. EPA has identified 500 wastes as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Notification is required for releases of hazardous substances into waters of the United States or the contiguous zone, with EPA identifying 500 wastes as hazardous substances. CERCLA authorizes remedial action for releases, and hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are regulated under the Clean Water Act. EPA has outlined options for addressing discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances into U.S. waters. EPA has suggested various options to address hazardous waste discharges, including setting standards to reduce contaminants on cruise ships and increasing inspections of facilities receiving cruise ship waste. The Clean Water Act and Coast Guard regulations prohibit cruise ships from discharging oil or hazardous substances into U.S. waters. Vessels must comply with specific discharge requirements and maintain an Oil Record Book. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also imposes additional regulations on waste disposal. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution for U.S. flagged ships and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Cruise lines, mostly foreign registered, have limited applicability to APPS regulations for oil discharge. Since most cruise lines are foreign registered, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations. Options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships include establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet standards, imposing penalties for noncompliance, banning discharge into U.S. waters, or revising inspection practices. Clean Water Act regulations have historically exempted ballast water and other incidental discharges. Since the 1970s, Clean Water Act regulations exempted ballast water and other incidental discharges from NPDES permit requirements. In January 1999, conservation organizations petitioned EPA to regulate ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, citing long-standing agency policy. The EPA rejected a petition to regulate ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act, citing the \"normal operation\" exclusion as long-standing agency policy. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges by vessels were primarily voluntary until 2004, when all vessels with ballast water tanks were required to have a management plan. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit after the denial of their petition. In 2005, environmental groups filed a lawsuit to force EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting. A federal court ruled in favor of the groups in 2006, ordering EPA to set aside the regulation by September 30, 2008. The ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2008, applying to other vessel discharges as well. In response to a court ruling in 2006, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) in December 2008, applying to various vessel discharges including graywater, bilge water, and ballast water. The permit covers large recreational and commercial vessels over 79 feet in length, as well as smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. The VGP applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial and fishing vessels. It covers discharges into US waters within the 3-mile territorial limit, addressing 26 types of waste streams including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, metals, and toxic pollutants, controlled by best management practices described in the permit. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial and fishing vessels. It addresses various waste streams including pathogens, oil, metals, and pollutants with toxic effects, controlled by best management practices described in the permit. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements apply. Sewage discharges from vessels are regulated under a different law. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial and fishing vessels. It includes detailed requirements for certain discharges on cruise ships, such as graywater and pool and spa water, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual chlorine. Operational limits are also set for cruise ship graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. Sewage discharges from vessels are regulated under a different law. The 110th Congress considered legislation regarding ballast water discharge issues, which aimed to provide a uniform national approach for addressing aquatic nuisance species. Some groups opposed the legislation as it would preempt states from enacting more stringent ballast water management programs than Coast Guard requirements, despite the Clean Water Act allowing states to adopt stricter rules. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality concerns, requiring EPA to set health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for sources of air pollution. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until February 2003 when EPA established standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels. H.R. 2830 aimed to preempt states from enacting stricter ballast water management programs than Coast Guard requirements, despite the Clean Water Act allowing states to adopt more stringent rules. The legislation did not include citizen suit provisions and saw no further action. In February 2003, EPA regulated cruise ship emissions by setting emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels. The rule was a result of litigation brought by the environmental group Bluewater Network, leading to equivalent standards to those set in Annex VI of the MARPOL protocol for nitrogen oxides. This regulation marked the first time that emissions from large ocean-going vessels, including cruise ships, were subject to EPA regulation. The EPA regulated emissions from large ocean-going vessels, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships, in 2003. This rule established emissions standards for nonroad engines and vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The EPA planned to set more stringent emission standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. The EPA planned to set more stringent emission standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO, despite criticism for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules. The 2003 rules were upheld in June 2004, and the EPA considered including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for more stringent standards. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen standards in October 2008. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, concerning air pollution standards for vessels. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI for new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. In December 2009, EPA promulgated changes to CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines, aligning with IMO requirements for emissions standards. The EPA rule establishes emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide for newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels. In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA, subjecting ships to more stringent emission limitations starting in 2014. The IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA, subjecting ships to more stringent emission limitations starting in 2014. The Clean Water Act treats navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as distinct entities, with specific definitions for each. President Reagan signed a proclamation in 1988 extending the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. President Reagan signed a proclamation in 1988 extending the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. President Clinton later extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights to 24 nautical miles from the baseline. President Clinton extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile width of the contiguous zone. This proclamation did not change the statutory definitions, so the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles. The Clean Water Act defines the \"ocean\" as any portion of the high seas beyond the territorial sea. The definition of \"waters\" includes waters of the United States, incorporating the Clean Water Act's definitions of \"territorial seas\" and \"contiguous zone\". Limits of jurisdiction are important for specific laws and rules to apply, such as Clean Water Act standards for sewage discharges and NPDES permits for point source discharges. Section 311 of the CWA addresses oil pollution. The Clean Water Act and other related regulations address sewage, oil, and hazardous substance discharges into navigable waters. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also regulates discharges of oil and noxious substances. The MPRSA governs ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline, with jurisdictional considerations including differences in mile measurements. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution is a significant concern due to tourism and commercial fisheries. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has become a major concern due to the increase in cruise ship visits during the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for violating environmental regulations by knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska waters. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties in Alaska for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances, part of an $18 million federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Public concern led to a program to identify cruise ship waste streams, revealing that waste treatment systems on most ships did not meet Coast Guard standards. Fecal coliform levels in discharges far exceeded regulations. The Alaska cruise ship waste treatment systems greatly exceeded U.S. Coast Guard standards for fecal coliform levels. Federal legislation was passed in December 2000 to establish standards for vessels with 500 or more overnight passengers, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in Alaska's navigable waters. EPA was authorized to set standards for cruise ship sewage and graywater discharges in these waters. The legislation passed in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships with 500 or more overnight passengers in Alaska, prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge. EPA was authorized to set regulations for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships in Alaska waters. Cruise ships are allowed to discharge treated sewage wastes in Alaska waters under specific conditions until EPA issues regulations. Vessels with advanced treatment systems can discharge treated sewage and graywater closer to shore and at lower speeds. The legislation passed in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships with 500 or more overnight passengers in Alaska, prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge. Vessels with advanced treatment systems can discharge treated sewage and graywater closer to shore and at lower speeds, with specific effluent standards to meet. Coast Guard oversight and enforcement require sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators. EPA regulations were issued in 2001 to implement the federal law, with penalties for violations. The regulations, effective since 2001, enforce minimum sampling and testing procedures for cruise ships in Alaska, with penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to assess treatment systems on ships and determine if revised standards are needed. Data from wastewater samples collected in 2004 and 2005 were summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. EPA also distributed a survey in 2004 on sewage and graywater effectiveness, costs, and impacts. The 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report summarizes information collected to evaluate treatment systems for large cruise vessels in Alaska. Sampling efforts show that advanced wastewater treatment systems are effective in treating various pollutants. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate cruise ship wastewater discharge. EPA collaborated with the state on plume tracking surveys and studies to estimate the dilution of treated sewage and graywater discharges from docked cruise ships. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate cruise ship wastewater discharge, setting standards and sampling requirements for blackwater and graywater. Effluent standards for large cruise ships were implemented in 2001 for blackwater and in 2003 for graywater. Small ships were also included in the sampling requirements. Effluent standards for blackwater and graywater discharges by large cruise ships were implemented in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Small ships were given three years to comply with the standards. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. Large ships either installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or held their wastewater for discharge outside Alaskan waters. By 2006, 23 out of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters had complied with the standards. As of 2006, 23 out of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters had installed advanced wastewater treatment systems to meet effluent standards. Small ships have not upgraded their systems, leading to pollutants exceeding water quality standards, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. Test results showed that concentrations of free chlorine, fecal coliform, copper, and zinc from smaller vessels pose risks to aquatic life and human health in areas where aquatic life is consumed. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay taxes for each passenger, increase fines for wastewater violations, and implement new environmental regulations. Revenues from the taxes will benefit local communities and public services. Supporters argue that the cruise industry does not pay enough in taxes to offset its environmental impact, while opponents fear the initiative will harm Alaska's competitiveness. In response to a citizen initiative in Alaska, cruise lines are facing increased taxes and fines for environmental violations. Some cruise ship lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative. Legislation has been enacted to give more time for implementing wastewater treatment standards. Similar regulations on cruise ship discharges have been seen in other states as well. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation regulating cruise ship discharges into coastal waters. The law applies to large ships and requires advanced wastewater treatment systems, compliance with federal laws, and a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Graywater discharges were allowed before 2006 if ships met certain treatment system requirements. Maine enacted legislation in 2004 regulating cruise ship discharges into coastal waters, requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems and a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater dischargers were allowed if ships met specific treatment system requirements. California also passed laws in 2004 and 2003 to restrict cruise ship discharges, including bans on releasing treated wastewater, graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, and oil bilge water. EPA approved Maine's request for a No Discharge Zone in Casco Bay in 2006. California has enacted several laws to regulate cruise ship discharges, including bans on releasing graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes. California S.B. 497 requires ballast water performance standards by 2008 and mandates the removal of invasive species by 2020. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have also made agreements with the industry. Several states, including Florida, Washington, and Hawaii, have agreements with the cruise industry to adhere to waste management practices. For example, Florida requires cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste off-loaded in the US annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the Coast Guard. Washington also signed a memorandum of understanding in 2004 for cruise ships to discharge waste. In April 2004, Washington signed a memorandum of understanding with cruise ships to discharge wastewater treated with advanced systems into state waters, prohibiting untreated wastewater and sludge discharge. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue they can impose stricter requirements. In June 2009, the Department of Ecology reported that cruise ships visiting Washington during the 2008 sailing season mostly complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater. The state argues that having voluntary agreements in place to protect water quality is beneficial, despite enforcement challenges. Pressure from environmental advocates and the industry's desire to promote a positive image have led to initiatives from the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). The cruise ship industry, under pressure from environmental advocates and with a strong desire to promote a positive image, has implemented waste management practices and procedures. Members of CLIA have adopted guidelines for discharging graywater and blackwater only while underway and at least 4 miles from shore, and for recycling or disposing of hazardous wastes in accordance with laws. They have also implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and auditing oversight, certified in accordance with the IMO's International Safety Management Code. The cruise industry has implemented Safety Management System plans for wastewater systems and auditing oversight, certified by the IMO. They are working on developing technologies for lower emission engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The industry has partnered with Conservation International for conservation efforts in coastal areas. The cruise industry partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas. Initiatives include improving wastewater management on cruise ships, protecting natural and cultural assets of destinations, raising awareness on conservation issues, and educating vendors on reducing environmental impacts. A joint initiative was announced in 2006 to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect critical marine ecosystems. In 2006, CLIA and CI announced a joint initiative to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect critical marine and coastal ecosystems. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) committed to retrofit all vessels in its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so. This move followed federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations, resulting in RCCL paying criminal fines totaling $27 million. The cruise ship industry, particularly Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL), has made efforts to improve environmental practices after facing federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are sufficient, and there is a challenge in obtaining resources to address the problems. The adequacy of existing U.S. laws, international protocols, state activities, and industry initiatives in managing cruise ship pollution is a key issue that may require legislative changes. The challenge lies in determining if current laws and regulations adequately address cruise ship pollution, particularly in areas like graywater contamination. Legislative changes may be necessary to fill gaps and strengthen requirements. Investigations have shown significant contamination in cruise ship graywater, raising concerns about fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics. State of Alaska officials found substantial contamination of cruise ship graywater with fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics. Graywater from ships' galley and sink waste streams tested higher for fecal coliform than sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including uniform discharge standards, recordkeeping, sampling, testing, and monitoring by vessel operators. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed uniform discharge standards and waste management procedures for cruise vessels, including required sampling, testing, and monitoring. The legislation aimed to prohibit cruise ships from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without compliance with prescribed effluent limits and management standards. EPA and the Coast Guard would be directed to establish effluent limits for cruise ship discharges. The Clean Cruise Ship Act aims to regulate cruise ship discharges into U.S. waters, including the Great Lakes, by enforcing strict effluent limits and management standards. It requires cruise ships to treat wastewater and grants federal enforcement authority for inspection and testing. Passenger fees would fund implementation by EPA and the Coast Guard. Environmental advocates support the legislation, while industry groups argue it unfairly targets a small percentage of ships with already high environmental standards. Environmental advocates and industry groups have differing opinions on legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges. Some states have already passed regulations, prompting the need for potential federal legislation to harmonize approaches. Congress is also considering the EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship waste, including sewage and graywater discharges. In 2000, Congress authorized EPA to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, examining various waste streams from cruise ships and discussing federal actions to address them. The report identifies possible options to manage cruise ship discharges but states that EPA has not determined if any options are necessary, feasible, or warranted. The report discusses federal actions to address cruise ship waste streams, including possible options and alternatives. It highlights the need for harmonizing U.S. laws on jurisdictional terms, defining \"cruise ship,\" and updating regulations to reflect technological advancements. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research to understand cruise ship waste generation, impacts of discharges, and potential control technologies. Research can help identify the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritize resources to address significant threats. The commission recommended research on pollutant transport in the marine environment and small passenger vessel practices. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy emphasized the need for research on cruise ship waste generation, impacts of discharges, and control technologies. Research can help understand the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritize resources. Directions for research include pollutant transport in the marine environment, small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for concentrated sludge, cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems, and vessel air emissions. EPA suggested establishing a nationwide sampling program and increasing studies on human health. The 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report highlighted the need for research on cruise ship discharges and their impacts on air quality standards. Existing laws and regulations may not be effectively enforced, requiring monitoring of discharges to evaluate current standards. Increased federal oversight of cruise ships is necessary to address these issues. The GAO emphasized the need for monitoring cruise ship discharges to assess current standards and management effectiveness. Increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard is necessary to address maintenance, operation of pollution prevention equipment, and proper off-loading of waste. Coast Guard's resources for enforcement, including vessel inspections, have been questioned even before the September 11 attacks. The Coast Guard's resources for enforcing cruise ship pollution regulations have been questioned, especially regarding vessel inspections. Possible options for enforcement include improving monitoring, involving passengers in detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. EPA and GAO have raised concerns about the adequacy of resources for monitoring and enforcing pollution control on cruise ships. The Coast Guard's resources for enforcing cruise ship pollution regulations have been questioned. Possible options for enforcement include improving monitoring, involving passengers in detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. GAO recommended that the Coast Guard work with the IMO to encourage member countries to respond when pollution cases are referred to them."
