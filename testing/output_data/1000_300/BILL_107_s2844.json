    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children (I Teach) Act of 2002\". Congress finds that there is a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade. The No Child Left Behind Act requires States to recruit qualified teachers by 2006, especially in rural and high-poverty schools. Rural education is crucial in 25 States, and high poverty schools often lack certified teachers in their fields. The Education Trust study shows high poverty schools struggle with teacher certification. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards aims to establish high standards for teachers nationwide. Standards is an independent, nonprofit organization with a mission to establish high standards for teachers. Over 16,000 teachers from all 50 states have completed certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, which significantly outperforms non-certified teachers on key measures of teaching expertise. Teacher salaries have remained stagnant over the past decade. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certifies teachers who significantly outperform non-certified peers on key teaching measures. Teacher salaries have stagnated over the past decade, with two-thirds of states below the national average. The Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools and provide tax credits for National Board certification to attract and retain qualified teachers. The Act introduces a tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. A tax credit is introduced for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year. The applicable amount is $1,000 for teachers in public kindergartens or elementary/secondary schools meeting specific criteria. A tax credit of $1,000 is available for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools. Public kindergartens or schools with at least 75% of students receiving free or reduced-cost lunches, or with a School Locale Code of 7 or 8, qualify for the credit. Certified teachers by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards also receive $1,000. The Secretary of Education outlines the applicable amounts for certified teachers based on their qualifications and location. Eligible teachers are defined as full-time kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teachers in public schools. Teachers in high poverty or rural schools can receive $2,000, while certified teachers receive $1,000. The section outlines definitions for eligible academic year and public schools, with conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section before section 35. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is also updated to reflect these changes. Sec. 35 provides a tax credit for teachers in high poverty or rural areas. Sec. 36 addresses overpayments of tax. These amendments apply to academic years ending after December 31, 2002."
