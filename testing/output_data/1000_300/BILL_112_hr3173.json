Congress finds that nearly 2,600 marine facilities and 13,000 US-flag vessels require workers to carry a TWIC under the MTSA. Over two million transportation workers have applied for a TWIC, costing $132.50 each, requiring multiple trips to an enrollment center. Nearly two million transportation workers have applied for and received a TWIC, costing $132.50 each. The card is valid for five years, requiring workers to make multiple trips to an enrollment center to renew it. Workers also face the burden of traveling long distances to reach the nearest enrollment center. The TWIC enrollment process, not mandated by statute, requires multiple trips to a center due to DHS policy aligning with FIPS-201 standards. DHS may deviate from this standard if deemed necessary for the TWIC program. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with the FIPS-201 standard, but deviations are allowed if necessary. Possession of a TWIC does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has the authority to develop an alternative enrollment process that minimizes trips to enrollment centers. DHS has the authority to develop an alternative process for TWIC enrollment that reduces the need for multiple trips to enrollment centers. Other secure identity documents, like passports, can be mailed to applicants. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers by August 2010, but it has not been issued yet. Congress believes urgent reform is needed for the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should implement TWIC reader regulations promptly for security. Port Security Grant funds for TWIC projects should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to reform the TWIC application process within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, limiting in-person visits to one except in special circumstances. This was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
