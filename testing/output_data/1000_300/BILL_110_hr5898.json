The Act aims to create a grant program to establish and improve State-administered notification systems for finding missing seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia-related illnesses. It also aims to promote best practices for Silver Alert systems and increase awareness for coordinated efforts to locate missing individuals quickly. SEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Congress finds that Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people in the US, with a higher risk for those over 60. Data shows 1 in 8 individuals over 65 have the disease, and every 71 seconds someone new develops it. The aging baby boomer population will further increase the number of those with Alzheimer's and dementia-related illnesses. The aging baby boomer population in the US will lead to a rise in Alzheimer's disease and dementia cases. More than 60% of Alzheimer's patients may wander away from their care facilities. Some states have implemented notification systems to address this issue. States like Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas have set up notification systems similar to the Amber Alert for missing seniors with dementia. Timely dissemination of information increases the chances of locating missing individuals. Other states have struggled to implement such systems due to budget constraints. Silver Alert systems in various states have definitive criteria for issuing alerts, ensuring they are not overly frequent or based solely on age. Alerts are only issued for individuals incapable of making personal care decisions. Other states have faced challenges implementing similar systems due to budget constraints. Silver Alerts should only be issued for individuals who are incapable of making personal care decisions. Alerts must be initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing individual and is a legal guardian, close family member, resident of the same household, or caregiver. The privacy, dignity, independence, and autonomy of the individuals must be protected. Silver Alerts should encourage training for law enforcement officers and first responders on locating missing individuals with dementia-related illnesses and effective communication methods. Coordination between state officials and local entities administering programs is also encouraged. The Federal Government can help prevent injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease by assisting states with the costs of implementing Silver Alert systems. Coordination between state officials and local entities is crucial for the success of these programs. The Silver Alert System Grant Program is established to assist states in implementing Silver Alert systems for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Coordination between state officials and local entities is essential for the success of these programs. The Attorney General can award grants to States to establish or improve Silver Alert systems for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Grants are for one-year periods, with a minimum award of $100,000 per State. Regulations will be prescribed for eligibility and application criteria within one year of the Act's enactment. The Attorney General will prescribe regulations for States to receive grants under this Act, including eligibility, application criteria, and selection criteria. $5,600,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON SILVER ALERT SYSTEMS. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems, including a list of states with such systems, the number of alerts issued and individuals located, the average time to locate individuals, the issuing agency, dissemination process, and operational costs. The annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems includes information on the criteria for issuing alerts, actions taken to protect privacy and dignity of individuals, communication improvements between families and authorities, and any other relevant details determined by the Attorney General. States have improved communication about missing individuals between families, caregivers, law enforcement officials, and other authorities, as well as any other relevant information determined by the Attorney General. The Silver Alert system is a State-administered notification system to locate missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The term \"State\" includes all states of the United States, as well as territories like Puerto Rico and Guam."
