    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and summarizes the budgetary context and major components of the Trump Administration's budget request. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated for the military activities of the Department of Defense. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $718.3 billion for the military activities of the Department of Defense, with the remaining budget for defense-related activities of other agencies. The bill does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or the TRICARE for Life program. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $718.3 billion for military activities, excluding funding for military construction, family housing, and the TRICARE for Life program. The total DOD budget is $687.8 billion, $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. Since 2001, DOD has structured its budget to distinguish between post-9/11 activities and base budget costs. Since 2001, the DOD has allocated funds for post-9/11 activities separate from its base budget. The non-base budget funds are designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and are exempt from spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The FY2020 defense budget request was $576.2 billion, with additional funds allocated for emergency requirements like storm damage remediation. The FY2020 defense budget request included $576.2 billion for the base budget and an additional $97.9 billion designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the defense spending cap to $666.5 billion, rendering the issue moot. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill was enacted on August 2, 2019, raising the defense spending cap to $666.5 billion. The House and Senate each reported separate versions of the bill, with a compromise version agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators and incorporated into another bill (H.R. 1158). The FY2020 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 1158, was passed by both chambers without a formal conference report. The bill reflects a shift in strategic emphasis towards countering threats from China and Russia, marking a change from past national security policies. The U.S. national security policy shifted from focusing on countering terrorism and regional aggressors to renewing emphasis on competition with nuclear-armed powers, particularly China and Russia. After the 9/11 attacks, U.S. national security policy shifted to focus on countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East, while also addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs. However, the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. These events highlighted the need for renewed emphasis on competition with nuclear-armed powers like Russia and China. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea underscored the importance of competing with great powers like Russia and China in the U.S. national security agenda. Adversaries are collaborating to achieve shared objectives, utilizing social and economic tools, and working with non-state proxies to advance their agendas. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, blurring lines between conventional and irregular conflict, and collaborating with non-state proxies. Conceptualizing and managing these complex security challenges is more difficult than in the past. The 2018 National Defense Strategy reorients U.S. national security towards great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. This shift acknowledges the erosion of U.S. military capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese and Russian threats, requiring a new approach to achieving military objectives. The Trump Administration's strategic orientation aligns with prior administrations in identifying five significant external threats to U.S. interests. The Trump Administration's strategic orientation, as outlined in the National Security Strategy (NSS) and National Defense Strategy (NDS), prioritizes countering China and Russia over violent extremist organizations. This \"2+3\" strategy focuses on addressing two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Federal government spending on military outlays has increased significantly since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. Since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, federal government spending on military outlays has increased significantly. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to control federal spending through sequestration if discretionary spending budgets did not meet separate caps on defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion. Sequestration automatically cancels previous appropriations to meet the spending caps, with exceptions for emergency or OCO funding. Congress has raised the spending caps, but the national defense spending cap for FY2020 remained at $576 billion. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion. Sequestration cancels previous appropriations to meet spending caps, with exceptions for emergency or OCO funding. The national defense spending cap for FY2020 was $576 billion, leading to a modest net increase in funding under P.L. 116-93. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest net increase in active-duty military personnel across all armed forces, with a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength. The act also supports a proposed decrease in the end-strength of the Selected Reserve. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and allocates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Additionally, $3.0 million is provided for a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorizes funding for various programs, including a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma. Additionally, the act adds $110 million to the DOD's childcare program, supporting the modernization of nuclear and long-range capabilities. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorizes funding for various programs, including plans to increase DOD's childcare system capacity and prioritize the top 50 childcare center construction requirements. The Act also supports the modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons, with a focus on developing hypersonic long-range missiles with conventional warheads. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorizes funding for various programs, including the development of hypersonic long-range missiles with conventional warheads. The Department of Defense (DOD) has prioritized the research and development of hypersonic weapons due to concerns about China and Russia's advancements in this technology. Funding has been secured from Congress to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) authorized funding to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program, with Congress supporting the FY2020 DOD budget request. The act provided additional funding for defenses against hypersonic missiles and established a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. In FY2020, concerns were raised about duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development within the defense bill. P.L. 116-93 supported strengthening defenses against ballistic missile attacks, reflecting recommendations from the Administration's Missile Defense Review. The bill shifted funding among components for defending U.S. territory against ICBMs. The FY2020 defense bill shifted funds to develop an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) after the cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle (RKV) program. The bill also allocated funds for additional GBI missiles, support equipment, and research to improve GBI reliability. Congress supported the Administration's funding requests for military space satellites and satellite launches. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for additional GBI missiles, support equipment, and R&D to improve GBI reliability. Congress approved $40 million for the newly created Space Force, which was 44% less than requested due to insufficient justification provided by DOD. The bill also directed the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a month-by-month spending plan for Space Force O&M funding. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for additional GBI missiles and R&D to improve reliability. The act supported upgrades to the Army's ground-combat vehicles, including a 30% increase in funding for the Stryker troop-carrier's firepower. The Army's strategy for new combat capabilities received mixed congressional support, with plans to fund new programs partly with anticipated future budgets. The Army plans to develop new combat capabilities by reallocating funds from existing upgrade programs for legacy systems. This includes cutting funds for Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters upgrades. The enacted appropriations bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, with the cut funds labeled as \"excess to need.\" The enacted appropriations bill provides $223.0 million less than requested for Bradley upgrades, labeled as \"excess to need.\" However, it appropriates $46.2 million for Chinook upgrades, nearly triple the amount requested. The bill challenges the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the CH-47 fleet and reins in the Army's third effort in 20 years to develop a Bradley replacement, providing $205.6 million of the $378.4 million requested. The Army's plan to forego upgrades to the CH-47 fleet was challenged by committees. P.L. 116-93 provided $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, which was criticized for being too technologically ambitious. After the enactment of P.L. 116-93, the Army cancelled the OMFV contracting plan and restarted it with new design parameters. The budget request for major aviation programs of all four armed forces was generally supported by P.L. 116-93. The Army's decision to forego upgrades to the CH-47 fleet was challenged by Congress. The FY2020 defense bill supported major aviation programs but insisted on continuing the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The Army had initially requested $46.4 million for procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s, but amended the request to $18.2 million to truncate the planned procurement. The Army's FY2020 request for improved \"Block II\" CH-47s was reduced from $46.4 million to $18.2 million. The FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program. Additionally, $985.5 million was allocated for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps, with $364.4 million shifted to the Air Force's Research and Development account for testing purposes. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $985.5 million for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps, with $364.4 million shifted to the Air Force's Research and Development account for testing purposes. P.L. 116-93 supports major elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request, including funds for construction of unmanned surface and subsurface ships to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for construction of unmanned surface and subsurface ships to increase the fleet size. The act departed from the budget request by reallocating funds for Virginia-class submarines and incorporating the Virginia Payload Module. Additionally, it provided funds for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $1.2 billion for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units, with four large-diameter, vertical launch tubes for additional Tomahawk missiles.
