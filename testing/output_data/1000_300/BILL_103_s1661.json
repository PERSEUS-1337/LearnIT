    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use increases worker exposure to workplace injuries and illnesses. The lack of Federal standards for these warnings places an undue burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and preempting any conflicting State standards. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, will issue a final regulation establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use within 12 months of enactment. Personal protective equipment includes gear for protecting workers from workplace hazards. The final regulation will establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment used in occupational settings to protect workers from workplace hazards. The warnings will describe actions, procedures, or prohibitions related to the use of the equipment, with non-compliance potentially resulting in personal injury or death. Manufacturers must communicate these warnings to employers using the equipment. The standard for personal protective equipment will require employers to communicate warnings to employees, train them on proper use and consequences of non-compliance, and become effective 6 months after issuance. The standard for personal protective equipment mandates employers to communicate warnings to employees, train them on proper use, and understand consequences of non-compliance. It becomes effective 6 months after publication in the Federal Register and exempts pre-existing equipment unless warnings are communicated as required. The Secretary considers manufacturer experience and communication methods when promulgating standards. The Secretary considers manufacturer experience and communication methods when promulgating standards for personal protective equipment. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 and Section 18 of the U.S. Code are amended to clarify that Congress intends to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and that no state or political subdivision can establish standards different from those set by the Secretary of Labor under section 6(h) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The Secretary may not approve a state plan that includes requirements different from those in occupational safety and health standards set by the Secretary under section 6(h)."
