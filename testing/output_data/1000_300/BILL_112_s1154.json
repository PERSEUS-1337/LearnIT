    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honoring Promises to Service-Disabled Veterans Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges that federal agencies must comply with the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, which set a goal for awarding contracts to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. However, progress in meeting this goal has been slow, and prime contractors working with the government also have a responsibility to help achieve it. Progress in meeting the goal for awarding contracts to service-disabled veterans has been slow. Prime contractors working with the government have an obligation to contribute to meeting this goal. The public has a right to know if government departments and prime contractors are meeting the goal for service-disabled veterans. SEC. 3. Transparency in contracting goals for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. Section 15 of the Small Business Act is amended to include transparency in contracting goals for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. This requires covered contractors to submit subcontracting plans to Executive departments, with reports to the Administrator every three months. The head of each Executive department must submit a quarterly report to the Administrator, including the percentage of prime contracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, names of contractors receiving contracts, and subcontracting goals negotiated for small businesses. The Executive department must report the percentage goal negotiated for subcontracting to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans and the percentage of subcontracts awarded to these businesses by contractors. The Executive department must report the percentage goal negotiated for subcontracting to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans and the percentage of subcontracts awarded to these businesses by contractors. This includes the weighted average percentage goal negotiated by each covered contractor for subcontracting to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and the percentage of total subcontract value awarded to these businesses. The Administrator ranks Executive departments based on the percentage of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The Administrator ranks Executive departments based on the percentage of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The Administrator shall publish on a website accessible to the public a user-friendly summary of subcontract awards to small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. The Administrator ranks Executive departments based on subcontract awards to small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. A user-friendly, electronically searchable report containing submitted information and rankings will be published on a public website, with an exception for national security concerns. The Administrator will not publish information detrimental to national security on the website and will update it quarterly. An annual report on Executive departments' progress towards meeting contracting goals will be submitted to Congress. Each report under this paragraph shall include a statement on the website's latest data and a recommendation for a prime contractor recognized by Congress for outstanding progress in contracting with small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. Congress recognized outstanding progress in contracting with small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, with no impact on other reporting requirements under Federal law."
