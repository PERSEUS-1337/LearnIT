The National Science Foundation is recognized for its role in strengthening the nation's information infrastructure and supporting research in automation and digitization. Its assistance in basic research and curriculum development is crucial for industries to leverage advanced communications and information technology. Information management is projected to grow significantly in key sectors related to biology by 2010. Information management is projected to grow by 49 percent in key sectors related to biology by 2010. There is no systematic plan in place for designing and implementing systems and information tools to help the workforce transition to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector - The Director of the National Science Foundation.\nInformation - Data in sectors where the Federal Government is involved and transitioning to digital data use.\nInstitution of higher education - Defined as per section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, awards grants for research on improving information systems in areas like information studies, population informatics, translational informatics, and data security. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2008-2010.
