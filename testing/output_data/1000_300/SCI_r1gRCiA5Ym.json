Jumpout improves dropout in deep neural networks by rescaling outputs for a better trade-off between variance and mean of neurons, addressing incompatibility with batch normalization. It shows significantly improved performance on various datasets while introducing minimal additional memory and computation costs. Dropout is a simple yet effective technique to mitigate overfitting by randomly setting hidden neuron activations to 0. Dropout is a technique in deep neural networks that randomly sets hidden neuron activations to 0 to prevent overfitting. However, it requires tuning dropout rates for optimal performance, which can slow down convergence if too high or yield no improvements if too low. Ideally, dropout rates should be tuned separately for each layer and training stage, but in practice, a single dropout rate is often used to reduce computation. In practice, a single dropout rate is often used to reduce computation, but ideally, dropout rates should be tuned separately for each layer and training stage to improve generalization performance. Treating dropout as a perturbation on each training sample helps generalize the DNN to noisy samples with a specific expected amount of perturbation. However, using a fixed dropout rate may rule out samples with less perturbation that could potentially improve generalization. Applying a constant dropout rate to layers with different fractions of activated neurons can result in varying effective dropout rates. The use of a constant dropout rate in deep neural networks can lead to varying effective dropout rates, causing too much or too little perturbation in different layers and samples. Additionally, dropout is not compatible with batch normalization, as rescaling undropped neurons to match the original activation gain breaks normalization parameters consistency between training and test phases. This incompatibility can result in poor behavior when used together. The text discusses the drawbacks of using dropout with batch normalization in deep neural networks. It proposes three modifications to dropout to address these issues, leading to an improved version called \"jumpout.\" The approach is motivated by observations on how dropout enhances generalization performance for DNNs with ReLU activations. The text discusses how dropout improves generalization performance for DNNs with ReLU activations by changing activation patterns and polyhedral structures. This leads to training linear models to work for data points in nearby polyhedra, explaining the generalization improvement. Dropout improves generalization performance by smoothing linear models to work on data points in nearby polyhedra. With a fixed dropout rate, the typical number of units dropped out is np, leading to local smoothness. In jumpout, the dropout rate is a random variable sampled from a decreasing distribution, ensuring smoother transitions between units. In jumpout, the dropout rate is a random variable sampled from a decreasing distribution, ensuring smoother transitions between units. The probability of smoothing polyhedra to other points decreases as points move farther away. Additionally, in jumpout, the effective dropout rate can vary significantly as it is adaptively normalized for each layer and training stage. In jumpout, the dropout rate is adaptively normalized for each layer and training sample, ensuring consistent neural deactivation rates. The outputs are rescaled to maintain variance, allowing for compatibility with Batch Normalization. This approach combines the benefits of dropout and BN in training Deep Neural Networks. Jumpout, a new approach similar to dropout, randomly generates a 0/1 mask over hidden neurons without requiring extra training. It can be easily implemented and outperforms dropout on various tasks, showing similar memory and computation costs. Previous methods like BID1 have proposed adaptive dropout rates, but jumpout offers consistent neural deactivation rates and compatibility with Batch Normalization.

It outperforms dropout on various tasks and offers consistent neural deactivation rates. Previous methods like BID1 proposed adaptive dropout rates, but jumpout adjusts the dropout rate based on ReLU activation patterns without relying on additional trained models. Jumpout is a novel method that adjusts dropout rates based on ReLU activation patterns, without the need for extra trained models. It introduces minimal computational overhead and can easily be integrated into existing model architectures. Previous studies have explored variations of dropout, such as Gaussian dropout and variational dropout, to optimize convergence and reduce gradient estimator variance. Jumpout is a novel method that adjusts dropout rates based on ReLU activation patterns, without the need for extra trained models. It introduces minimal computational overhead and can easily be integrated into existing model architectures. BID11 extended variational dropout to reduce gradient estimator variance and achieve sparse dropout rates. Other recent dropout variants include Swapout BID16 and Fraternal Dropout BID25, which aim to generalize dropout to different neural network architectures and shrink the gap between training and test phases. Jumpout can be applied alongside most other dropout methods. Jumpout is a dropout method that adjusts rates based on ReLU activation patterns, integrating easily into existing models. It can be used alongside other dropout variants like Swapout and Fraternal Dropout to generalize to different neural network architectures. The DNN formalization presented in the curr_chunk can represent various DNN architectures, including fully-connected networks and convolutional networks. The convolution operator is essentially a matrix multiplication, resulting in a sparse weight matrix with tied parameters. Average-pooling can be represented as a matrix multiplication as well. The DNN formalization in the curr_chunk discusses the representation of residual network blocks and piecewise linear activation functions like ReLU. It explains how average-pooling and max-pooling can be treated as matrix operations, and how shortcut connections can be added to the DNN. The DNN in Eqn. FORMULA0 can be represented as a piecewise linear function using ReLU activation. The activation patterns at each layer modify the weight matrix, eventually leading to a linear model. The gradient \u2202x represents the weight vector of the linear model. The DNN with ReLU activation can be simplified to a linear model by eliminating ReLU functions. The linear model is defined by activation patterns on all layers, forming a convex polyhedron. ReLU units are cost-effective and widely used, with dropout improving generalization performance. Dropout improves the generalization performance of a DNN by promoting independence among neurons and training a diverse network. This is achieved by preventing co-adaptation of neurons and randomly dropping a portion of them during training. Dropout improves DNN performance by promoting neuron independence and training a diverse network. It prevents co-adaptation by randomly dropping neurons during training, creating an ensemble effect during testing. Dropout also smooths local linear models in the network, enhancing generalization. The input space for a DNN with ReLUs is divided into convex polyhedra, where each data point in a polyhedron behaves like a linear model. Large DNNs with many neurons can have exponentially many polyhedra, leading to dispersed training samples and distinct local linear models for each data point. Nearby polyhedra may correspond to different linear models due to consecutively multiplying weight matrices. The input space for a DNN with ReLUs is divided into convex polyhedra, where each data point behaves like a linear model. The resulting linear models can differ significantly if the activation patterns of two polyhedra differ on critical rows of the weight matrices. This can lead to a lack of smoothness in the model, making the DNN fragile and unstable on new data, weakening its generalization ability. To address this, a dropout rate is proposed to be sampled from a truncated half-normal distribution. To address the lack of smoothness in DNN models and improve generalization ability, a dropout rate is proposed to be sampled from a truncated half-normal distribution, ensuring a monotone decreasing probability. This approach aims to prevent the model from performing unstably on new data. The dropout rate is sampled from a Gaussian-based distribution to control generalization enforcement, with smaller rates sampled more frequently. This encourages smoothness in the generalization performance of local linear models, performing well on points in closer polyhedra but less effectively on points farther away. The dropout rate for each layer is a hyper-parameter that controls smoothness among nearby local linear models. Tuning dropout rates separately for different layers can improve network performance, but it is often computationally expensive. One common approach is to set a global dropout rate for all layers, which may not be optimal due to the varying proportions of active neurons in each layer. To address the issue of varying proportions of active neurons in different layers during training, the dropout rate is normalized by the fraction of active neurons. This normalization helps control dropout behavior across layers and training stages, leading to more consistent activation patterns and improved network performance. Normalization of dropout rates by the fraction of active neurons helps achieve consistent activation patterns and improved network performance. This approach allows for precise tuning of the dropout rate as a single hyper-parameter, leading to smoother encouragement without compatibility issues with batch normalization. The incompatibility between dropout and batch normalization arises from variance differences between training and test phases, leading to unpredictable DNN behavior. One proposed solution involves combining dropout layers with BN layers in a specific sequence. The text discusses how dropout affects the mean and variance of neurons during training, which can lead to inconsistencies with batch normalization during testing. This variance difference between training and test phases can result in unpredictable behavior in deep neural networks. During training, dropout affects the mean and variance of neurons, leading to inconsistencies with batch normalization during testing. To counteract this, rescaling the output y j can help recover the original scale of the mean and variance. Rescaling dropped neurons by (1 \u2212 p j ) \u22121 is necessary for the mean, while a factor of (1 \u2212 p j ) \u22120.5 is needed for the variance if E(y j ) is small. Taking into account the value of E[w j ] can further refine the scaling, but this requires additional computation and memory cost. During training, dropout affects the mean and variance of neurons, leading to inconsistencies with batch normalization during testing. Rescaling the output y j by (1 \u2212 p j ) \u22121 is necessary for the mean, while a factor of (1 \u2212 p j ) \u22120.5 is needed for the variance if E(y j ) is small. Additional computation and memory cost are required to compute information about w j, the weight matrix of the following layer. The rescaling factor (1 \u2212 p j ) \u22121 should be used to make the mean consistent, while no simple scaling method can resolve the shift in both mean and variance. The network is \"CIFAR10(s)\" and the plots show the empirical mean and variance ratios with dropout applied. The rescaling factor (1 \u2212 p) \u22120.75 provides a trade-off between mean and variance rescaling in the network \"CIFAR10(s)\". It ensures that the mean and variance ratios with dropout applied are close to 1, maintaining consistency during training and testing. The rescaling factor (1 \u2212 p) \u22120.75 is proposed to maintain consistency in mean and variance ratios with dropout applied in the network \"CIFAR10(s)\". It ensures that the variance remains unchanged and provides a trade-off point between (1\u2212p) \u22121 and (1\u2212p) \u22120.5, making the mean and variance sufficiently consistent. The rescaling factor (1 \u2212 p) \u22120.75 is proposed to maintain consistency in mean and variance ratios with dropout applied in the network \"CIFAR10(s)\". It ensures that the variance remains unchanged and provides a trade-off point between (1\u2212p) \u22121 and (1\u2212p) \u22120.5, making the mean and variance sufficiently consistent. The study compares the performance of dropout with and without Batch Normalization in convolutional networks, showing that using dropout with BN can improve performance. However, using the original dropout with BN leads to decreased accuracy with dropout rates over 0.15. In contrast, the proposed improved dropout with rescaling shows performance improvement with increasing dropout rates, being the best among the configurations tested. The proposed improved dropout, named \"Jumpout,\" combines three modifications to overcome original dropout drawbacks. Jumpout samples from a decreasing distribution for random dropout rates and normalizes adaptively based on active neurons. It further scales outputs by (1 \u2212 p) \u22120.75 for consistent regularization and generalization effects. Jumpout normalizes dropout rates adaptively based on active neurons, scales outputs by (1 \u2212 p) \u22120.75 for regularization, and requires hyperparameters \u03c3, p min, and p max. Tuning \u03c3 yielded good performance, with p min set at 0.01 and p max at 0.6. In practice, Jumpout has three hyperparameters: \u03c3, p min, and p max. Tuning \u03c3 resulted in good performance, with p min set at 0.01 and p max at 0.6. The input h j is considered as the features of layer j for one data point. For a mini-batch, the average q + j over data points is used as the estimate. Jumpout has a similar memory cost as original dropout, with minimal computation required for counting active neurons and sampling from the distribution. Jumpout has a memory cost similar to original dropout, with minimal computation needed for counting active neurons and sampling from the distribution. It is applied to various DNN architectures and compared on six benchmark datasets of different scales.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of jumpout. Jumpout demonstrates superior performance compared to dropout on various datasets, including CIFAR100 and ImageNet. A thorough ablation study confirms the effectiveness of jumpout and its three proposed modifications.
