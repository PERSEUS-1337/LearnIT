Multidimensional Upscaling is used to map 3-bit 32 \u00d7 32 RGB subimages to 8-bit 128 \u00d7 128 RGB images, aiming to learn the full distribution over 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size with high fidelity. The model focuses on visually salient subsets of the distribution, such as sub-images of smaller size and the most significant bits of each RGB channel. Multidimensional Upscaling is utilized to upscale 3-bit 32 \u00d7 32 RGB subimages to 8-bit 128 \u00d7 128 RGB images.
