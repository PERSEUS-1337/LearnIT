    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings in the United States. The country leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized nations. The rate of unintentional deaths from firearms for children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. Additionally, a significant number of children are treated for nonfatal unintentional gunshot wounds in US hospitals annually. Studies have shown that these incidents often involve handguns. A study in California found that children as young as 3 years old can fire most handguns. Currently, firearms in the US are not subject to minimum safety standards. A 1997 poll found that 74% of Americans support safety regulation of the firearms industry, as firearms and safety locks move in interstate commerce. Many available trigger locks are inadequate to prevent accidental discharge or children accessing firearms. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. Regulations will include a minimum safety standard for these products, considering both detachable and permanently installed options. The Secretary will develop a standard for handgun discharge protection products, ensuring they are of high quality and prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard may require products to be permanently installed and include access methods like keys or combinations. Test protocols for poison prevention packaging standards may be considered in developing the standard. The Secretary will develop a standard for handgun discharge protection products within 12 months of the enactment of the Act. The standard, based on poison prevention packaging protocols, will take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS.

Criminal penalties include fines and imprisonment for knowingly violating the Act regarding handgun discharge protection products. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW.
