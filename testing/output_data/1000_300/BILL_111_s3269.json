    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers aged 16 have a crash rate almost 10 times higher than drivers aged 30-60. They account for over 1/3 of fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly 2/3 of fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The chance of a crash for 16-17 year olds doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers' performance. Teenage drivers have a higher crash rate at night, with over 50% of fatalities occurring during nighttime driving. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported a decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers after implementing Florida's graduated driver licensing system in 1997. According to studies, the implementation of graduated driver licensing systems in various states led to a decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers. In Florida, there was a 9% reduction in crashes in 1997 compared to 1995. Michigan and North Carolina saw a 25-27% decrease in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers between 1995 and 1999. California also experienced a decline in teenage passenger deaths and injuries from crashes involving 16-year-olds between 1998 and 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, California's graduated driver licensing program led to a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers, as well as a 24% decline in at-fault collisions. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 states have implemented similar systems, but many have not included all safety features. Many states have not fully implemented key safety features of graduated driver licensing laws to protect teenage and novice drivers, despite widespread support for requirements such as practice driving hours, learner's permit periods, and limits on teenage passengers. State graduated driver licensing laws are outlined in Section 3. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process, starting with a learner's permit stage that lasts at least 6 months and prohibits the use of cell phones while driving. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process. The learner's permit stage lasts at least 6 months and prohibits the use of cell phones while driving. The intermediate stage follows immediately after the learner's permit stage, also lasting at least 6 months and including restrictions on nighttime driving. The intermediate stage remains in effect until the driver either reaches 18 years of age or transitions to the next stage. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing process starts immediately after the learner's permit stage, lasting at least 6 months. It includes restrictions on cell phone use, nighttime driving, non-familial passengers under 21, and remains in effect until the driver turns 18. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing process includes requirements such as 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old at all times while operating a motor vehicle. In the learner's permit or intermediate stage, a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old must supervise the driver at all times while operating a motor vehicle. Additionally, any individual convicted of a driving-related offense during this stage will have their unrestricted driver's license automatically delayed. During the learner's permit or intermediate stage, a driver convicted of a driving-related offense, such as driving while intoxicated or reckless driving, will face consequences. The Secretary of Transportation will create regulations to enforce this section. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. For the first 3 fiscal years post-enactment, the Secretary of Transportation will grant funds to compliant States. States must apply with the required information and Governor certification of compliance. The Secretary will review applications to determine compliance with section 3(a). The Secretary will review State applications for compliance with section 3(a) and grant funds to compliant States based on a formula using funds apportioned under title 23, United States Code. Grant funds can be used for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process. The Secretary will grant funds to compliant States based on a formula using funds apportioned under title 23, United States Code. States can use the funds for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials related to the State graduated driver licensing law, and other administrative activities. $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from the Highway Trust Fund for this purpose. The Secretary authorizes $25,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for the State's 2-stage licensing process. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth fiscal year, the withholding increases to 5 percent. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from states not complying with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold funds from states not complying with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. Any withheld funds before the sixth fiscal year will remain available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the amount is appropriated. However, funds withheld after the sixth fiscal year may not be distributed to the state. After the sixth fiscal year, funds withheld under subsection (a)(2) may not be distributed to the State. If a State complies with section 3(a) before the funds are no longer available, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute the withheld amounts to the State. Any amounts withheld under subsection (a) must be distributed to the State for apportionment. The distributed funds remain available for the State to spend until the end of the third fiscal year after apportionment. If a State is not compliant with section 3(a), the withheld amount reverts back to the Treasury of the United States."
