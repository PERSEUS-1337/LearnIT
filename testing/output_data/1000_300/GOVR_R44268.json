    "content": "Operation Ranch Hand was a U.S. military program during the Vietnam War that sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in Vietnam, with airbases like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat showing high levels of contamination. The A Luoi Valley was also a significant area along the Ho Chi Minh Trail used by North Vietnamese forces. The A Luoi Valley in Vietnam, a former U.S. military base, is identified as a \"hot spot\" for contamination with TCDD from Agent Orange. U.S. efforts to address the environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam have helped improve bilateral relations between the two nations. President Obama pledged continued support in removing unexploded landmines, bombs, and dioxin. President Obama pledged continued support in removing unexploded landmines, bombs, and dioxin in Vietnam. The joint effort to remove dioxin from Danang Airport is nearly complete, with cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base underway. The Trump Administration has also committed to assisting Vietnam with the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. The Trump Administration continues to support Vietnam in addressing the Agent Orange/dioxin issue, with a focus on cleanup efforts at Bien Hoa Air Base. A joint statement between President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc highlighted their commitment to addressing war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation and the removal of unexploded ordnances. Environmental remediation at Danang Airport was celebrated in November 2017, with a Memorandum of Intent signed in January 2018 to begin further collaboration. The completion of environmental remediation at Danang Airport was celebrated in November 2017, followed by a Memorandum of Intent signed in January 2018 for dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for Agent Orange/dioxin cleanup and health programs in Vietnam since 2007, with more funds typically allocated for environmental remediation. The 115th Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation in Vietnam, with the Secretary of Defense authorized to transfer up to $15,000,000 for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup. The actual amount available for assistance may be less than specified due to legislative provisions. Funds were allocated in FY2019 for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam, with the Department of Defense transferring funds to USAID. The State Department has delegated administration to USAID, focusing on environmental remediation at Danang airport and health programs for disabilities. The environmental remediation effort in Vietnam has focused on cleaning up the Danang airport and addressing health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure. Funds have been appropriated to USAID for these programs, which are administered in cooperation with the Vietnamese government. Joint dioxin removal operations have been arranged at the Bien Hoa airbase, and discussions are ongoing regarding health and disability problems among Vietnamese nationals. The State Department and USAID have administered programs funded by appropriated funds in cooperation with various ministries and agencies in Vietnam. The Office of the National Steering Committee on Overcoming Consequences of Agent Orange/Dioxin in Vietnam was created by Vietnam's central government in 1999 to oversee its policy on Agent Orange and dioxin. Congressional interest has focused on two main issues. The Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA), Ministry of National Defence (MND), Ministry of Planning and Investment (MOPI), and Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) are involved in addressing environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" and health programs in Vietnam. Congressional interest focuses on funding allocation for these programs and oversight of State Department and USAID expenditures. Funds were first appropriated in May 2007 by the 110th Congress to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in Vietnam. The 110th Congress appropriated $3 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and health programs near contaminated sites. The State Department designated USAID to handle the administration and obligation of the funds, setting a precedent for future appropriations. The 111th Congress later allocated an additional $18 million for similar purposes. In subsequent legislation, the 111th Congress allocated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam. This included $3 million in March 2009, $3 million in December 2009, and $12 million in July 2010 specifically for remediation at the Danang Airport. In July 2010, Congress allocated $12 million for dioxin contamination remediation at Danang Airport in Vietnam. Additionally, $1.9 million was allocated for environmental remediation at the airport in FY2010. The State Department and USAID were directed to develop a comprehensive plan for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam within 180 days after the enactment of the law. USAID, in consultation with relevant parties, developed a multiyear plan for Agent Orange activities in Vietnam. Congress continued to appropriate funds for environmental remediation and health services related to Agent Orange. Various Acts renewed appropriations for FY2013 and FY2014, with specific allocations for remediation and health programs in affected areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) allocated $22.0 million for environmental remediation and $7.0 million for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) designated funds for dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health activities in areas sprayed with Agent Orange. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The 114th Congress appropriated funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health/disability programs in areas sprayed with Agent Orange. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. S.Rept. 114-79, which accompanied P.L. 114-113, provided funding for health/disability programs in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or contaminated with dioxin to assist individuals with severe mobility impairment and cognitive or developmental disabilities. Funding for FY2017 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Committee aims to maximize impact by having Vietnamese organizations implement health/disability funds. Funding for FY2017, as stated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, includes allocations for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. Specifically, $20,000,000 is designated for dioxin remediation and $10,000,000 for health and disability programs in affected areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated funds for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Act specified $20 million for dioxin remediation and $10 million for health and disability programs in contaminated areas. In March 2018, the 115th Congress appropriated not less than $20 million for activities related to the remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam, allowing assistance to the Government of Vietnam for the first time. In March 2018, the 115th Congress allocated not less than $20 million for dioxin remediation in Vietnam, with funds available for assistance to the Government of Vietnam. Additionally, $10 million was appropriated for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with dioxin. In 2019, the 116th Congress allocated funds for dioxin remediation and health programs in Vietnam. USAID is responsible for distributing the funds, with 81% of the $127 million already obligated as of May 2018. USAID has obligated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam, with 81% of $127 million for environmental remediation projects and 63.5% of $44.3 million for health- and disability-related services already allocated. Congressional concerns have been raised regarding the allocation of funds for health and disability activities by USAID. Congress has raised concerns about how USAID has obligated appropriations for health and disability activities, particularly regarding the slower pace of utilization compared to environmental remediation funds. Funds designated for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities are to be used for health programs in communities near contaminated areas. The $3 million appropriated in FY2007 in P.L. 110-28 was designated for health programs in communities near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas. Additional funds were allocated for environmental remediation of dioxin contamination at specific locations in Vietnam. It is uncertain if all funds have been used according to the specified locations. The State Department and USAID may not have consistently obligated funds according to locational guidance for health- and disability-related services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam. Funds were directed to programs in Danang from FY2007 to FY2009, but from FY2010 to FY2013, funds were mainly allocated to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) for a disability support program without specific reference to \"hot spots.\" USAID resumed direct funding for health- and disability-related services in smaller amounts from FY2014 onwards after consultations with relevant parties. Since FY2014, USAID has shifted to smaller direct program funding for health- and disability-related services in Vietnam after consultations with relevant parties. This change is reflected in Table 1. One significant activity funded by congressional appropriations is the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, which has faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, initiated in 2008, faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The project, initially planned for completion by October 2013, was finished in August 2017. The estimated decontamination material increased from 61,700 m3 to 90,000 m3, with an additional 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" Costs escalated from $33.7 million to over $110 million due to unexpected challenges. The joint military/civilian airport in Danang was a major operational hub for the U.S. military's Operation Ranch Hand. Soil at Danang airbase had high levels of \"TCDD toxic equivalents\" (TEQ), exceeding international standards. Work on the environmental remediation project began in December 2009, with costs increasing from $33.7 million to over $110 million. USAID and Office 33 were designated as implementing agencies under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MONRE). The MOU between USAID and Office 33 outlined environmental health and remediation programs in Danang, covering $6.0 million in funds. A grant was given to CDM International, Inc. for an engineering approach to dioxin containment at Danang airport. An Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption to decontaminate 61,700 m3 of material at a cost of $33.7 million, with potential challenges increasing costs by 50%. The Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption for decontaminating material at Danang airport, estimated to cost $33.7 million with potential challenges increasing costs by 50%. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent to start the remediation project in 2011, with contracts awarded in 2012 to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. In July 2012, USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for the environmental remediation of Danang airport. CDM Smith received $8.37 million for project oversight and construction management, while Tetra Tech, Inc. was granted $17 million for excavation and construction. Work began in August 2012, with an internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealing six contracts awarded for the project. The environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport included thermal desorption of contaminated soil in two phases. Phase 1 treated 45,000 m3 of soil, removing over 95% of dioxin by April 2015. Phase 2 involved draining lakes and treating soil, completed in August 2017. Progress on the decontamination of Danang airport was delayed due to various factors such as weather conditions, increased soil testing requirements, and technical issues with the treatment facility. USAID's Office of Inspector General conducted an internal audit of the environmental remediation project. The facility was shut down in July 2014 to change the filtering system and raise the soil temperature. USAID's audit identified risks like inclement weather and cooling soil, recommending a formal risk management plan. CDM was cited for inaccurate data and lack of training for Vietnamese officials. The audit identified issues with CDM's performance, including inaccurate data and lack of training for Vietnamese officials. USAID agreed with the recommendations for more training and better data documentation procedures. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected due to underestimating contamination levels. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected due to underestimating contamination levels. USAID provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of the disability, starting in 1989 with a program financed by the Leahy War Victims Fund. The U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese through the Leahy War Victims Fund, regardless of the cause of disability. Funds were allocated for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized these funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program in 2012. In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH). The program aimed to build on previous assistance to people with disabilities in Danang and included public health activities. The project focused on Danang and other high-need areas with dioxin hot spots. Funding for PDSP was initially set at $9 million. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, aimed to assist persons with disabilities in high-need areas with dioxin hot spots like Bien Hoa and Phu Cat. DAI awarded grants for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. USAID also supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs in Vietnam. The program expanded to provinces like Quang Nam and Tay Ninh. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, aimed to assist persons with disabilities in high-need areas with dioxin hot spots like Bien Hoa and Phu Cat. USAID extended the program to provinces such as Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue, which were heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Grants totaling nearly US$900,000 were awarded to local partners and organizations. USAID adopted a new approach to providing assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam, aiming to address key challenges and foster expanded opportunities for vulnerable populations. USAID aims to provide direct assistance to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life for persons with disabilities in Vietnam. They will offer physical, occupational, and speech therapies, as well as training to practitioners in high-need areas where disability prevalence and poverty rates are high, such as Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue provinces. USAID will administer new programs in provinces with high disability prevalence and poverty rates, including Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue. The environmental cleanup of Danang airport is completed, and efforts are underway to clean up the dioxin \"hot spot\" at Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed during the war. The Bien Hoa airbase was heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the war, leading to high levels of dioxin contamination in the soil. The Vietnamese government has taken some measures to contain the contamination, but there are still \"hot spots\" that have not been addressed. Contaminated soil has spread into nearby water bodies according to a study by Hatfield Consultants. A study by Hatfield Consultants found dioxin \"hot spots\" at Bien Hoa airbase that have not been addressed, with contaminated soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The United Nations Development Programme has been working with Office 33 and MONRE on a master plan for dioxin remediation, estimating 250,000 m3 of soil requiring decontamination at a cost of $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to assess dioxin remediation alternatives at the airbase. In September 2013, USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to conduct an environmental assessment of the Bien Hoa airbase, partnering with Hatfield Consulting. The final report in May 2016 estimated 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments on or near the airbase. Five treatment methods were considered, with costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. The report noted potential cost variations of 40% less to 75% more than the estimated amounts. The estimated costs for environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase ranged from $137 million to $794 million for different methods. USAID has allocated over $3.7 million for assessment. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has started infrastructure construction for decontamination with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent in January 2018 to begin decontamination efforts. The budget for decontamination at Bien Hoa airport is $11.8 million, with operations including demining and road construction. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent in January 2018 to start the decontamination process. A $183 million aid agreement was signed in May 2018 for the project, estimated to cost $390 million over 10 years. The Ministry of National Defence signed a $183 million aid agreement in May 2018 for the decontamination of Bien Hoa airport, projected to take 10 years at a cost of $390 million. A memorandum of understanding was signed with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory using a new technique to decontaminate soil. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the airport in October 2018. The new decontamination technique at Bien Hoa airport can process 40 tons of soil per hour, costing half as much as previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site, reaffirming America's commitment to remediate past environmental damage. Congressional focus on Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam includes determining appropriate assistance and oversight of its utilization. The focus has largely been on determining assistance for environmental damage and health effects of dioxin contamination in Vietnam, as well as oversight of State Department and USAID utilization of funds for decontamination projects. Congress and administrations have shown support for addressing Agent Orange and dioxin issues in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues funding for health and disability services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin, following past practices. President Obama's budget requests did not explicitly include funding for these programs, focusing instead on disability programs and vulnerable groups. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange. The Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) aims to provide assistance for Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975. It requires the Secretary of State to address their healthcare needs, provide medical services, vocational training, and repair substandard homes in Vietnam. The Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) requires the Secretary of State to provide assistance for Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975. This includes healthcare, medical services, vocational training, repairing substandard homes, supporting research on health issues, and remediation of areas with high levels of Agent Orange. The Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) requires the Secretary of State to prioritize heavily sprayed areas in Vietnam for assistance related to Agent Orange exposure. Quarterly reports on implementation must be submitted to Congress by relevant Secretaries. Congress oversees funding for environmental remediation and health services in affected areas. Congress oversees the funding for environmental remediation and health services in Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam, focusing on cost overruns at Danang airport and the slow pace of fund utilization by USAID. The estimated total cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million, with cost overruns and delays. USAID struggled to utilize funds for health services in Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas, with only 63.5% of funds from FY2011 to FY2017 being obligated. USAID has faced challenges in effectively utilizing funds for health services in Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas, with only 63.5% of funds from FY2011 to FY2017 being obligated. Congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management of funds is reflected in legislation, indicating a shift in approach from direct obligation to cooperative agreements and back to direct obligation. H.R. 326 appropriates funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, reflecting congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management of funds. Specific funding amounts are detailed in accompanying reports or explanatory statements."
