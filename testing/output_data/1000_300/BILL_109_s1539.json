    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, aiming to provide each child with a permanent home. Despite incentives for adoptions, many children in foster care are still waiting to be adopted, especially older children with special needs. In 2003, over 118,000 children in foster care are waiting for adoption despite an increase in adoptions. These children have special needs and require federal financial assistance for healing from past abuse and neglect. SEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for placement with a public or licensed private agency. This includes being in the care of such an agency due to safety concerns in the home and meeting medical or disability requirements for supplemental security. The amendment to Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act includes criteria for a child to be placed with a public or licensed private agency if it is determined that staying in the home would be unsafe or contrary to the child's welfare. This includes meeting medical or disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits and being a child with special needs as determined by the State. The amendment to Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act states that a child may be placed with an agency if staying at home is unsafe or contrary to their welfare. A child with special needs, as determined by the State, may receive adoption assistance payments. Non-US citizen children meeting certain criteria can also qualify for these payments. The amendment to Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act allows for children who were previously eligible for adoption assistance payments to still qualify if their prior adoption was dissolved or if their adoptive parents have passed away. Additionally, a new exception states that no payment may be made to parents for a child if it is unsafe for the child to stay at home or if it goes against their welfare. The amendment to Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act prohibits payments to parents for children with special needs who are not US citizens or residents and were adopted internationally. This does not apply if the child is placed in foster care after a failed adoption. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 requires states to use savings from reduced expenditures on children with special needs for providing services to children or families, including post-adoption services. Additionally, the determination of a child with special needs under the Social Security Act is amended. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 mandates states to use savings from reduced expenditures on children with special needs for services, including post-adoption services. The Social Security Act is amended regarding the determination of a child with special needs. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 requires states to determine if a child has specific factors or conditions that make it difficult to be placed with adoptive parents without adoption assistance and medical assistance. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 mandates that states assess if a child has factors hindering placement with adoptive parents without adoption assistance or medical aid. The amendments take effect on October 1, 2005."
