    "content": "Credit for payments or contributions to certain cooperative research organizations. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures. Qualified cooperative research expenditures are defined as the total amount of qualified expenses for collaborative research activities. The term 'qualified cooperative research expenditures' refers to contributions to research consortia for research activities, subject to certain limitations. The taxpayer can elect for a subsection to apply, with a limitation on qualified contributions based on private source funding ratio. The private source funding ratio is calculated as 50% of the organization's gross receipts. The funding ratio is calculated based on the organization's gross receipts for the preceding taxable years, with specific percentages allocated to each year. The funding ratio is determined based on the organization's gross receipts for the preceding taxable years, with 20 percent allocated for the third preceding year. Limitations on qualified contributions include costs allocated to services exceeding cash contributions, overhead exceeding 25 percent of salary and benefits, and contributions to a taxpayer. Employees can contribute to a qualified cooperative research consortium if their overhead costs do not exceed 25 percent of salary and benefits. Contributions exceeding one-third of the consortium's total nongovernmental support are allowed. If the consortium has fewer than 5 participants, each person's contributions are limited. If a qualified cooperative research consortium has less than 5 persons making nongovernmental contributions, the qualified contributions of each person shall be reduced by 20 percent if there are 4 persons, or by 40 percent if there are 3 persons. A qualified cooperative research consortium is an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, with registration published and in effect on the last day of the organization's taxable year. The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 requires a qualified cooperative research consortium to be registered and have at least 5 contributors, with specific contribution limits for each member. The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 mandates that a qualified cooperative research consortium must be registered and have a minimum of 5 contributors, with contribution limits in place. Additionally, special rules apply for noncash contributions, ensuring fair distribution among members. Special rules apply for noncash contributions in qualified cooperative research, including services provided by employees at their cost. Overhead costs must be included in the services provided. Amounts considered for qualified cooperative research expenditures cannot be double-counted. Contributions paid or incurred during the taxable year to qualified cooperative research are subject to specific rules. The subsection on computing qualified cooperative research expenditures excludes certain contributions. Prepaid amounts for research conducted after the taxable year are treated as paid during that period. Each research consortium must submit a report to the Secretary with certification, funding ratio, and other required information. The amendments require research consortiums to submit a report to the Secretary with certification, funding ratio, and other necessary information. Each consortium must provide a copy of the report to each contributor. Effective for taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
