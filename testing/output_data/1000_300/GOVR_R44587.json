    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 as part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, the Independent Safety Board Act made the NTSB independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main functions include determining accident causes and suggesting safety improvements to prevent future incidents. The NTSB investigates accidents, recommends safety improvements, and assists victims' families in major disasters. It does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices in the transportation sector. The agency consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with regional offices in four locations. The NTSB consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with regional offices in four locations. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the NTSB to maintain at least one full-time employee in every state located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office. This impacts Hawaii, where the NTSB does not have a field office, but has maintained one aviation safety investigator. NTSB regional staff are now located in 25 states. The NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii and regional staff in 25 states. Safety Board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacement members are appointed. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode, with research and engineering supporting all offices. The NTSB also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners. The NTSB is organized by transportation mode, with separate offices for each mode. It also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners. The Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications tracks responses to safety recommendations and coordinates communications with stakeholders. The NTSB investigates transportation-related accidents and safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation-related accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, railroad accidents with passenger trains, pipeline accidents, major marine casualties, and other catastrophic accidents or recurring problems. The office coordinates communications with Congress, transportation stakeholders, and the public regarding Board actions and safety advocacy. The NTSB investigates major marine casualties and other catastrophic accidents involving transportation safety. It relies on the expertise of manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies through the \"party process\" to assist with investigations, with safeguards in place to prevent external influence on findings. The NTSB utilizes the \"party process\" to involve external entities in investigations, with safeguards in place to prevent influence on findings. Interested parties can provide technical expertise and submit analyses for consideration, but NTSB conclusions are based solely on staff analysis. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration of findings. The NTSB utilizes the \"party process\" for investigations, with safeguards to prevent influence. Parties can provide expertise but findings are based on staff analysis. The agency must meet publicly on most matters related to accident investigations and members must disclose financial interests. Despite safeguards, there is still potential for outside influence on the NTSB process, which could impact its credibility. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality and credibility during accident investigations, balancing the input of involved parties with preventing influence on the investigative process. This can lead to prolonged investigations and the need to evaluate competing perspectives. The agency follows international standards for aviation accident investigations. The NTSB follows international standards for aviation accident investigations, participating in foreign investigations when involving U.S.-manufactured or -registered aircraft. They may also assist other countries upon request, potentially being reimbursed for associated costs. The NTSB may be reimbursed for costs in overseas investigations from outside entities like foreign governments. P.L. 109-443 allows for such receipts to be used as offsetting collections. The NTSB has recovered costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through the Safe Skies for Africa program. Annual costs for international investigations have ranged from under $1 million to almost $2.4 million, with a portion covered by the program. The NTSB does not have direct authority to change transportation safety regulations. The NTSB's annual investigations cost between $1 million to $2.4 million, with some expenses covered by the Safe Skies for Africa program. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with over 14,300 recommendations made since 1967. Around 82% of these recommendations have led to safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond formally to each NTSB recommendation. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with about 82% leading to safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond formally to each recommendation within 90 days. The NTSB advocates for safety improvements and publicizes recommendations to build support. Implementation of recommendations may be delayed due to rulemaking processes, feasibility, costs, and benefits. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with about 82% leading to safety improvements. Implementation may be delayed due to rulemaking processes, feasibility, costs, and benefits. The NTSB does not consider benefit/cost in its recommendations and highlights key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with about 82% leading to safety improvements. These recommendations aim to prevent fatigue-related accidents, improve rail transit safety oversight, promote collision avoidance technologies in highway vehicles, strengthen occupant protection, minimize operator distractions, prevent loss of control in flight, promote completion of rail safety initiatives, end substance impairment in transportation, and require operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations typically require statutory and regulatory changes and have influenced the regulatory agenda of transportation agencies and congressional decision-making. The NTSB's safety recommendations and advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies and congressional decision-making. This influence is evident in legislation requiring positive train control systems, regulations to reduce pilot fatigue, laws addressing distracted driving, and improved safety standards for various modes of transportation. For example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 drew on NTSB investigations and recommendations for various provisions. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-190) incorporates NTSB recommendations for airline pilot training, pilot records database implementation, and mental health screening for pilots. This legislation addresses concerns about pilot skills in monitoring automated systems and controlling aircraft flightpath without autopilot, as well as the impact of cockpit automation on flying skills. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 includes provisions for mental health screening for pilots and evaluating crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. This legislation addresses concerns raised by the NTSB following past aviation incidents. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 mandates the FAA to address NTSB safety recommendations for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 includes provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors and requiring automatic shutoff valves. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 enhances pipeline safety by increasing federal inspectors and requiring automatic shutoff valves. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by operator error. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 enhances pipeline safety with more federal inspectors and automatic shutoff valves. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates positive train control to prevent incidents from operator error. Positive Train Control is expected to reduce incidents from excessive speed, conflicting train movements, and engineer failure to obey signals. The NTSB aims to minimize operator distractions causing accidents, with Congress establishing a distracted driving grant program in 2012. Only one state qualified for the grant in FY2014 and FY2015. The NTSB aims to improve transportation safety by addressing distracted driving through grants. Only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015, but a provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. This may be of interest during NTSB reauthorization proceedings. Funding for the NTSB includes base authorization, emergency funds for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations. The NTSB's funding includes a base authorization, emergency funds for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations. The existing statute maintains $2 million in the NTSB's emergency fund, with the option to increase it up to $4 million. The NTSB has not needed to use its emergency fund or seek supplemental appropriations in over a decade. The NTSB has not required emergency funds or additional appropriations in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, with the NTSB being responsive to GAO findings and implementing recommendations. In 2006-2008, GAO made 21 recommendations to NTSB, all effectively implemented by 2012. In 2013, GAO found NTSB had made improvements but needed to enhance training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. GAO recommended NTSB senior leaders develop a strategy for maximizing the cost accounting system utility. Current issues include staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, and safety issues like vehicle recorder recoverability in aviation. Legislation reauthorizing the NTSB includes staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, and safety issues like vehicle recorder recoverability in aviation and maritime accidents. NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in FY2008 but only received a 12% increase in the past decade. Additionally, railroad safety legislation in the 114th Congress addresses NTSB funding and resources for railroad accident investigations. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in FY2008 but only received a 12% increase in the past decade. Despite increased staffing, limited resources have led to delays in accident investigations, including some pipeline accidents and fatal railroad incidents. Congress may debate funding to address these issues. The NTSB faces challenges in investigating railroad accidents, including grade crossing and trespasser incidents. Congress may discuss the need for additional staffing to meet statutory requirements and address potential skill gaps. The NTSB has raised concerns about staffing shortages due to retirements and emerging skill gaps. The NTSB has staffing challenges in its Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB Training Center was completed in 2003 at George Washington University. The NTSB Training Center, located at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, was completed in 2003. Despite efforts to achieve financial self-sufficiency, the center operates at a deficit. Its main purpose is to train NTSB staff and industry personnel for accident investigations and victim assistance. Revenues from training fees are insufficient to cover costs. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, was built in 2003 to train NTSB staff and industry personnel for accident investigations and victim assistance. However, revenues from training fees have not been enough to cover the costs, leading to a deficit. The center also hosts forums and meetings on transportation safety topics, but struggles to fully recover its costs despite relying on leases and rentals. A 2006 GAO study raised concerns about the NTSB's ability to offset the training center's expenses. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University in Ashburn, VA, has faced financial challenges as revenues from training fees have not covered costs, leading to a deficit. The GAO report highlighted violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act due to lease negotiations and lack of budget authority for the 20-year lease term. Possible remedies include renegotiating the lease, obtaining deficiency appropriations, or vacating the space, with the latter deemed potentially cost-effective. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA has financial challenges as revenues do not cover costs, leading to a deficit. The GAO found improvements in utilization and lease revenue, reducing the operating deficit. However, the facility still does not recoup all operating costs. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center. The NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, VA has seen improved cost recovery, with the annual operating deficit decreasing from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, the facility still does not cover all operating costs. Congressional oversight may be limited in making significant changes before the lease agreement expires. Two main issues with data recorders include prompt recovery after accidents and concerns about privacy and public disclosure. The challenges in recovering accident recorders, especially from submerged aircraft and ships, have been highlighted. Recent accidents like Air France flight 447, EgyptAir flight 804, and Malaysia Airlines flight 370 have shown difficulties in retrieving recorder data promptly. Privacy concerns regarding public disclosures and non-accident related uses of recorder data have also been raised. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations urging for improved technology to transmit data from aircraft used for overwater flights. They also called for protections against disabling flight recorder devices and the installation of cockpit image recorders. The NTSB recommended improved technology for data transmission from aircraft, protections against disabling flight recorders, and cockpit image recorder installations. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aims to equip large passenger aircraft with continuous tracking and automatic deployable flight recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 raised concerns about recovering maritime voyage data recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 raised concerns about recovering maritime voyage data recorders, which are required for certain passenger and large cargo vessels under SOLAS regulations. The data recorder from El Faro was recovered 10 months after the accident, highlighting the challenges of locating and retrieving recorders from deep ocean depths. New regulations now require ships to have both retrievable fixed-mount units and float-away components for data storage. New regulations implemented in 2014 require new ships to have retrievable fixed-mount units and float-away components for data storage. While the NTSB has not made specific recommendations, concerns over data recovery may prompt congressional interest in assisting investigators. Event recorders are aiding accident investigations in various transportation modes, raising privacy concerns. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or for specific purposes like diagnostics or investigations. Privacy concerns arise as data collection capabilities increase in transportation accident investigations. The bill aims to restrict access to event data recorders in passenger vehicles, allowing access only with consent for specific purposes like diagnostics or investigations. It also requires a study on the appropriate data capture time for crash investigations. The NTSB is tasked with investigating railroad accidents but lacks resources. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 specifies $6.3 million in appropriations for railroad accident investigations in FY2016. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 authorizes appropriations of $6.3 million in FY2016, $6.4 million in FY2017, $6.5 million in FY2018, and $6.6 million in FY2019 for NTSB railroad accident investigations. It also addresses NTSB safety recommendations, requires plans for positive train control systems, and allows for grants to implement these plans. Additionally, it directs a study on the effectiveness of positive train control systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
