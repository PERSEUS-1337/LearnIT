    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" with interconnected computers worldwide identified by unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access, with TLDs like .com or .org. The DNS is a global database mapping addresses to domain names. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed set of databases containing address numbers mapped to domain names. Root servers coordinate connectivity across the Internet. The Internet originated from research funding by the Department of Defense, with support from the National Science Foundation. Key entities like the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) played roles in DNS management. Several entities played key roles in the management and operation of the Internet and the DNS. For example, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) made technical decisions concerning root servers, assigned unique protocol parameters, and managed the IP address space. NSF was responsible for registration of nonmilitary domain names and signed a cooperative agreement with a consortium of companies called InterNic in 1993. In 1992, NSF solicited for managing network services, leading to a cooperative agreement with InterNic in 1993. Network Solutions Inc. became the sole registrar for .com, .net, and .org domains. Criticism grew over NSI's control, leading to trademark disputes and concerns over IANA's legal foundation. This prompted actions in the US and internationally for Internet stability. The International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing additional registrars to compete for registration services. The U.S. government formed an interagency group led by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to evaluate the IAHC proposal for managing gTLDs. The U.S. government created an interagency group led by the NTIA to address the domain name issue. The White Paper endorsed a new not-for-profit corporation to administer policy for the Internet name and address system, ensuring stability, competition, and fair representation of the Internet community. The U.S. government assessed the new system for Internet management, leading to the creation of ICANN. Meetings were held to discuss the structure of the new corporation, which was submitted to the Department of Commerce in October 1998. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was proposed as a new corporation to manage DNS functions. The final version of ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. An official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN on November 25, 1998, to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. The MOU was extended until September 30, 2006, with specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. On June 30, 2005, the U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system were stated by NTIA. On September 29, 2006, DOC announced a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to continue the transition of DNS management to the private sector. The agreement extended through September 30. On September 29, 2006, the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced a Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to transition DNS management to the private sector. The JPA focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was agreed upon to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, security, stability, competition, and international participation. ICANN is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law. It aims to promote competition, consumer trust, and international participation in DNS management. The organization is overseen by a Board of Directors advised by various supporting organizations and advisory committees. The Board of Directors of ICANN consists of 16 international members representing various Internet constituencies. They are advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees, responsible for making final policy decisions. The organization has seen growth due to the expansion of the Internet, domain name registration, and the new gTLD program. The explosive growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to a significant increase in the ICANN budget, from $6 million in 2000 to $159 million in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Registrars are companies where consumers register domain names, while registry operators manage the master database of domain names for each top-level domain. Operators like VeriSign, Inc., Public Interest Registry, and Neustar, Inc. manage the master database of domain names in various top-level domains. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. The Department of Commerce has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The Department of Commerce (DOC) has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of network architecture enabling the domain name system to function. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The DOC retains a role with respect to the DNS via contractual agreements. The Department of Commerce (DOC) transferred technical DNS coordination functions to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government retains a role through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign. An Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was signed in 2009 to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization. The Department of Commerce (DOC) transferred DNS coordination functions to a private-sector entity through an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) in 2009. The AoC aims to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, succeeding the Joint Project Agreement. Various stakeholders debated whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN after the JPA expiration. U.S. industry groups argued for continued DOC oversight to prevent undue control of the DNS by foreign entities. Many stakeholders debated the need for continued U.S. government oversight of ICANN, with arguments for and against privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress, stating that more progress was needed in achieving accountability and transparency goals. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the expiration of the JPA between DOC. The Senate acknowledged ICANN's progress in accountability and transparency but emphasized the need for further improvement. NTIA sought public input on the JPA expiration, highlighting areas for enhancement such as stability, accountability, and stakeholder participation in ICANN's operations. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the transition of DNS management to the private sector, with members suggesting an extension of the JPA between DOC and ICANN rather than creating new agreements. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce recommended extending the JPA between DOC and ICANN to ensure perpetual accountability of ICANN to the public and global stakeholders. The instrument should maintain the current relationship, include periodic reviews of ICANN performance, outline steps for accountability improvement, implement new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, ensure access to WHOIS information, and confirm ICANN as a not-for-profit corporation. ICANN commits to maintaining timely access to WHOIS information and remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States under the Affirmation of Commitments (AoC). The AoC also calls for the establishment of review panels to evaluate ICANN governance and transparency. The panel will periodically make recommendations to the ICANN Board in four areas: Ensuring accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. It will evaluate ICANN governance, assess transparency, accountability, and responsiveness with respect to the public and the global Internet community. The panel will be composed of key stakeholders and independent experts, and will also review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. The panel, jointly agreed by the chair of the GAC and the chair of ICANN, will review ICANN's plan to enhance DNS operational stability, security, and global interoperability. It will include the GAC chair, ICANN CEO, Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, and independent experts. The panel will also assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and choice. The panel, jointly agreed by the chair of the GAC and the CEO of ICANN, will review existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting the needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. It will include representatives from relevant Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, independent experts, global law enforcement community, and global privacy experts. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011. The focus now shifts to ICANN management and staff for implementing these recommendations. A follow-up report, ATRT2, was submitted to the Board on December 31, 2013. The ATRT released recommendations for ICANN's transparency and accountability, which were adopted by the Board in June 2011. The focus now is on ICANN management and staff to implement these recommendations quickly and effectively. The ATRT2 follow-up report in December 2013 provided 12 new recommendations, mainly addressing issues from the first report. The IANA functions contract allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions related to the DNS, while a cooperative agreement with VeriSign authorizes them to maintain the official root zone file. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes to the DNS. The U.S. government aims to preserve the security and stability of the DNS and commits to maintaining its effective and efficient operation. The U.S. government aims to preserve the security and stability of the DNS and maintains authority over the root zone file. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015. The U.S. government awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with provisions for policy development separation, conflict of interest policy, respect for local law, and transparency requirements. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems based in the United States, allowing the government to inspect facilities and processes. The U.S. government awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN through September 30, 2015, with provisions for policy development separation, conflict of interest policy, respect for local law, and transparency requirements. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems based in the United States, allowing the government to inspect facilities and processes. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community, potentially letting its IANA functions contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA plans to let its IANA functions contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015, and is asking ICANN to work with global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. This includes collaboration with organizations like the IETF, IAB, ISOC, RIRs, top-level domain operators, and Verisign. In October 2013, Internet technical organizations called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The Internet technical organizations have called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA has specified that any transition proposal must have broad community support and adhere to four principles, including maintaining the multistakeholder model and the security of the Internet DNS. Supporters of the transition argue that by transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community, the U.S. government will bolster its support for the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. They believe this will enable the U.S. to effectively oppose proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet, as envisioned since the inception of ICANN. The transition is now possible due to ICANN's improved accountability and transparency. The transition of authority over IANA functions to ICANN is now possible, as ICANN has matured and improved its accountability and transparency. Critics are concerned that without NTIA's oversight, foreign governments may gain more influence over the Internet, potentially harming US interests. Critics are concerned about the potential risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new international multistakeholder entity that would oversee the domain name system. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prevent NTIA from relinquishing control over the Internet domain name system. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, introduced by Representative Shimkus, aims to prevent the NTIA from giving up oversight of the Internet domain name system. The bill requires a report from GAO on the implications of the change, including national security concerns and the definition of \"multistakeholder model.\" It was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014. The GAO was requested to examine the Administration's proposal to transition NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. The text of the DOTCOM Act was offered as an amendment to H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, and was passed by the House on the same day. The House Armed Services bill report accompanying H.R. 4435 stated the committee's belief in protecting the .mil domain and maintaining separation in root-zone management functions. The Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 2410 mentioned transferring the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority role from the US Government. The House Armed Services Committee emphasized protecting the .mil domain and maintaining separation in root-zone management functions. The Senate's S. 2410 recommended transferring the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority role from the US Government to a global multi-stakeholder community, with a focus on ensuring the exclusive use of the '.MIL' top-level domain and Internet Protocol address numbers by the Department of Defense for national security. The committee urged the Department of Defense to secure an agreement during the IANA transition process to ensure the .mil domain retains its current status. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was signed into law without the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of the Act expresses Congress's support for the .mil top-level domain's future. The enacted law (P.L. 113-235) does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 states that Congress supports the IANA transfer with assurances for the protection of legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers, consensus-based decision making, and accountability processes for a free, open, and resilient Internet. The multi-stakeholder model ensures transparent, secure, and efficient accountability processes for a free, open, and resilient Internet. Congress supports the Secretary of Defense in maintaining the Internet root zone servers. H.R. 4660, the FY2015 CJS Appropriations Act, does not include funds for NTIA to carry out the transition. The Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act does not include funds for NTIA to carry out the transition of Internet domain name system functions. An amendment in H.R. 4660 prohibits the use of funds to relinquish NTIA's responsibility in this regard. The House passed H.R. 4660 on May 30, 2014, regarding NTIA's responsibility for the Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. NTIA is required to report quarterly on the privatization process. The committee directed NTIA to report quarterly on the privatization process of the Internet domain name system functions and to inform the committee in advance of any decision on a successor contract. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds for certain activities during FY2015. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds for relinquishing its responsibility with respect to Internet domain name system functions, including the authoritative root zone file and the IANA functions. The prohibition on funding for NTIA's IANA transition activities expires on September 30, 2015. Additionally, NTIA is directed to inform appropriate Congressional committees in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with respect to ICANN or IANA. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds for relinquishing its responsibility with respect to Internet domain name system functions, including the authoritative root zone file and the IANA functions. It directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with respect to ICANN or IANA activities. Additionally, the Act requires NTIA to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations regarding any potential recourse available to the United States if a decision is made to transition to a new contract that is detrimental to the country. Other legislation, such as H.R. 4367 (Internet Stewardship Act of 2014), has also been introduced to address the proposed transition and prohibit NTIA from relinquishing its DNS responsibilities without statutory permission. Legislation introduced in 2014, including H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, aimed to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over domain name functions without specific criteria being met. These bills were referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced by Representative Shimkus as H.R. 805, prohibits NTIA from transferring responsibility over the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress. The report must analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed transfer, along with any criteria set by NTIA. H.R. 805 requires GAO to issue a report within one year of NTIA receiving a transition proposal. The report will analyze transfer proposals, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and the security of the Internet domain name system. It also includes defining the \"multistakeholder model\" and other relevant terms used by NTIA. The NTIA is using the term \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking and governance. H.R. 805 and S.Res. 71 were introduced in Congress to address the NTIA's proposed transition of the IANA functions to ICANN. S.Res. 71 aims to raise public awareness and emphasize the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. ICANN is preparing for potential responsibilities in the transition of IANA functions. S.Res. 71 passed the Senate on February 5, 2015, with a hearing held on February 25, 2015, discussing the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. ICANN is working on consensus for a transition proposal through two parallel tracks: IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. Feedback from the Internet community led to a draft proposal for Principles, Mechanisms, and Process development. ICANN is working on consensus for a transition proposal through two parallel tracks: IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. A steering group would be formed to steward the process in an open, transparent, inclusive, and accountable manner. The group would include representatives from various ICANN constituencies and parties affected by the transition of IANA functions. After receiving public comments, ICANN announced the formation of a Coordination Group responsible for preparing a transition proposal. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed by ICANN in response to public comments on the steering group draft proposal. The ICG, comprised of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, is tasked with coordinating the development of a transition proposal for the IANA functions. The group has requested proposals from the three operational communities associated with the primary IANA functions, with the goal of consolidating them into a single proposal. The ICG, formed by ICANN, is coordinating the development of a transition proposal for the IANA functions. Three proposals are being developed by operational communities for Domain Names, Number Resources, and Protocol Parameters. The Domain Names proposal is still in progress, while the Number Resources proposal was submitted to the ICG on January 15, 2015. The Protocol Parameters proposal is being shepherded by the IANAPLAN Working Group. The five RIRs and the IETF submitted final proposals for the numbering and protocol parameter functions to the ICG in January 2015. The domain name function proposal has faced delays, with the CWG-Stewardship group unable to meet deadlines. Transitioning the domain name IANA function, currently performed by ICANN, has proven challenging. The transition of the domain name IANA function from ICANN to a new organization or enhanced ICANN accountability measures is a complex and controversial debate within the multistakeholder community. In parallel, ICANN is also working on enhancing its accountability to ensure it remains accountable to Internet stakeholders in the future. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability to Internet stakeholders post IANA stewardship transition. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) is developing proposals to strengthen ICANN's accountability mechanisms. ICANN has formed a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) with 25 members and 141 participants to enhance its accountability towards stakeholders. Decisions will be made by consensus, and the group will be open to interested participants. Additionally, up to seven advisors will provide independent advice and research. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) includes various members and advisors to enhance ICANN's accountability. The group is working on two interrelated Work Streams focusing on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline. If approved, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. The accountability proposal, developed by the Cross Community Working Group, may extend beyond the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline. If approved, it will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. The Workstream 1 proposal is due in June 2015, while the Workstream 2 proposal will be submitted after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA must approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to occur. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015, or to amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign. Congress did not expect NTIA to remain inactive during the transition process. NTIA will actively monitor the transition process and participate in discussions with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders. Regular reporting to Congress is required to keep them informed. Administrator Strickling emphasized the importance of a well-thought-out plan for the transition process, urging the community to consider all proposal models carefully. He called for open participation and feedback to address concerns and ensure a successful transition. Administrator Strickling urged the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models carefully and ensure new organizational structures are accountable. NTIA emphasized the need for stress testing proposed solutions to safeguard against future contingencies and improve accountability tools. NTIA encourages the CWG-Stewardship group to address questions on board member removal, accountability tools, and synchronization of transition processes. NTIA aims to receive a transition plan by summer, with flexibility to extend the contract if needed for the best plan development. ICANN, an international organization, operates beyond national boundaries and involves members worldwide in policy decisions. The Governmental Advisory Committee provides advice on public policy matters, but the ICANN Board is not obligated to follow it. Foreign governments have raised concerns about ICANN's decision-making process. Many in the international community, including foreign governments, argue against the U.S. government's authority over ICANN and the DNS. The United Nations discussed greater international involvement in Internet governance at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 stating that no single government should have a dominant role in international Internet governance. The U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 proposing further internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. The report suggested four possible models, including ones where ICANN would be made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. U.S. officials opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. The report's conclusions from the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005 were considered, with U.S. officials opposing transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body. The EU initially supported the U.S. position but shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an Internet governance agreement announced on November 15, 2005, where ICANN and the United States maintained their roles with respect to the domain name system. An Internet governance agreement was reached in November 2005 between the United States, the EU, and over 100 other nations to maintain ICANN and the United States' roles in the domain name system. The agreement also established the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) under the U.N. to discuss Internet policy issues, with the IGF running through 2010 and later renewed for another five years in 2010. The U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) was tasked to develop a report on improving the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). A Working Group on Improvements to the IGF was formed with 22 governments and Internet stakeholder groups. Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 over new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on government influence on ICANN policy. Some nations, like the U.S., Canada, and the EU, supported the current multistakeholder model but advocated for an enhanced role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Others, such as Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA), favored creating a U.N.-based Internet policy entity. Some nations, including Russia and China, proposed a voluntary \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly, promoting a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet. The establishment of a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet was discussed by a group of nations. They released a revised International Code of Conduct for Information Security emphasizing equal responsibility for Internet governance. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai in 2012 by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) took place in Dubai in December 2012, convened by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs). One of the key discussions at the WCIT was how to address Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. The Administration and Congress advocated for the new ITRs to focus on traditional telecommunications traffic, maintain a multistakeholder model of Internet governance, and prevent the ITU from taking control. The Administration and Congress advocated for the new ITRs to focus on traditional telecommunications traffic, maintain a multistakeholder model of Internet governance, and prevent the ITU from taking control. Concerns in the 112th Congress heightened about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet at the WCIT. A hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to preserve the multistakeholder governance model. H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to preserve the multistakeholder governance model of the Internet and passed unanimously by the House. A similar resolution, S.Con.Res. 50, was introduced in the Senate to express the same sentiment. The House unanimously passed H.Con.Res. 127 on August 2, 2012, and the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 50 on September 22, 2012, to promote a global Internet free from government control. On December 5, 2012, the House unanimously passed S.Con.Res. 50 by a vote of 397-0, following the WCIT in Dubai where a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was supported by certain countries. The proposal was later withdrawn, but a nonbinding resolution was adopted by the ITU. The ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution titled \"To Foster an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet\" after a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was withdrawn. The resolution includes language on international Internet governance roles for governments, leading the United States to decline signing the treaty due to concerns over new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue. The United States declined to sign the treaty at the WCIT in Dubai due to concerns over new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress monitoring and overseeing efforts to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 was introduced to affirm the U.S. policy of preserving the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. H.R. 1580, similar to congressional resolutions S.Con.Res. 50 and H.Con.Res. 127, affirms the U.S. policy to uphold the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. It was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives in May 2013. In October 2013, ICANN's President and other Internet organizations' leaders called for strengthening global multistakeholder cooperation to prevent Internet fragmentation and maintain trust among users. The recommendations following the Montevideo Statement emphasized the importance of globally coherent Internet operations and warned against national Internet fragmentation. They expressed strong concern over trust erosion due to surveillance, identified the need to address Internet Governance challenges, and called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil to discuss plans for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014. The Montevideo Statement emphasized globally coherent Internet operations and warned against national fragmentation. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil to plan the NETmundial summit in April 2014, focusing on Internet governance principles and future evolution. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" setting forth general principles for Internet governance. The outcome of NETmundial was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" that reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, endorsed the transition of the U.S. government's role in IANA functions, emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum, and highlighted the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN also announced the formation of a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation. On November 17, 2013, ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation with stakeholders from various sectors. The Panel released a report in May 2014 outlining principles and frameworks for global Internet cooperation. In August 2014, the NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The purpose is to apply the NETmundial Principles to enable an effective approach to Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea, concluded on November 7, 2014, setting general policies, adopting strategic plans, and electing officials. The U.S. delegation had concerns about expanding ITU's role in Internet governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea, concluded successfully without expanding its role in Internet governance or cybersecurity issues. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of an address, with 22 gTLDs currently in operation. Prior to ICANN's establishment, there were eight gTLDs (.com, .org, .net, .gov, .mil, .edu, .int, and .arpa). In 2000 and 2004, ICANN held application rounds for new gTLDs; there are currently 22 gTLDs in operation. Some are reserved or restricted to specific organizations (e.g., .museum, .gov, .travel) while others are open for registration by anyone (.com, .org, .info). Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial and non-profit organizations seeking to become ICANN-recognized registries that will operate name servers for their TLD registry and implement a domain name registration process. Debate has focused on expanding the number of gTLDs due to the growth of the Internet and demand for domain names. Beginning in 2005, ICANN started a consultative process to develop rules for introducing new gTLDs. The growth of the Internet led to a debate on expanding the number of gTLDs. ICANN developed rules for introducing new gTLDs, with the approval of potentially hundreds of new gTLDs. Applications for new gTLDs were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a required fee of $185,000. ICANN approved a new gTLD program allowing potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced into the DNS. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a fee of $185,000. The program faced controversy from trademark holders concerned about higher costs and protecting their trademarks. Governments and law enforcement also expressed worries about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes across multiple new gTLDs. ICANN faced opposition from trademark holders and some parts of the U.S. government regarding the new gTLD program. Despite concerns, ICANN defended the program, stating that it would offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders. ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion as planned despite opposition. The new gTLD program aims to offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. ICANN received 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including geographic names and Internationalized Domain Names in scripts like Chinese, Arabic, and Cyrillic. ICANN received 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, including 66 geographic name applications and 116 Internationalized Domain Names in scripts like Chinese, Arabic, and Cyrillic. The evaluation phase will determine the approval of these applications, a process that could take 9 to 20 months. Rules and procedures are outlined in ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines rules and procedures for evaluating new gTLD applications. Currently, 894 gTLDs are in the process, with plans for future application rounds. Concerns exist about potential domain name abuse as new gTLDs go live. The effectiveness of ICANN's approach to addressing domain name abuse, intellectual property protection, and unlawful behavior in the new gTLD program is of interest. Legislation has been enacted to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" to protect children from inappropriate content on the Internet. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-317) authorized NTIA to establish the kids.us domain for age-appropriate content. Legislation for an adult content top-level domain like .xxx has also been considered in past Congresses but did not advance beyond introduction. ICANN considered creating a .xxx domain for adult content, which would be voluntary for adult websites to register in. The proposal sparked controversy, but no legislation advanced beyond introduction for a top-level domain for adult content. The proposal for a .xxx domain for adult websites was voluntary and controversial. The Department of Commerce and ICANN requested more time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children. Despite negotiations, the ICANN Board voted against accepting the domain on May 10, 2006. At the March 2006 Board meeting, ICANN authorized negotiations with ICM Registry regarding the .xxx domain. The Board later voted against accepting the proposed agreement but left room for a revised agreement. In January 2007, a revised agreement was published for public comment, but in March 2007, the Board denied the .xxx domain due to concerns about managing Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's rejection of their application for a .xxx gTLD before an Independent Review Panel. The panel ruled in favor of ICM Registry, stating that their application met the required criteria and that ICANN's reversal was not consistent with fair policy. The decision was not binding, and the ICANN Board postponed a final decision on the .xxx TLD at a meeting in March 2010. At ICANN's meeting in Brussels in June 2010, the Board approved ICM's .xxx TLD application to progress. Next steps included due diligence, negotiations on a registry agreement, and consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. In December, the Board resolved to enter into a registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx TLD, pending formal consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. At the ICANN meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, the Board passed a resolution to enter into a registry agreement with ICM Registry for the .xxx TLD, despite conflicts with GAC advice. A letter in February 2011 addressed these conflicts, but no approval was given by the GAC. The Board approved the agreement in March 2011, granting authority to establish the .xxx TLD. On March 18, 2011, at the ICANN meeting in San Francisco, the Board approved the resolution to establish the .xxx TLD, with nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. The .xxx domain became available in December 2011. DNSSEC technology was developed to address vulnerabilities in the DNS system, ensuring the validity of information. DNSSEC technology was developed to mitigate vulnerabilities in the DNS system, ensuring the validity of transmitted DNS addresses by digitally \"signing\" DNS data. \"Signing the root\" is a critical step in protecting against malicious attacks on the DNS. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC into the Internet's DNS infrastructure, including the root zone. NTIA, NIST, ICANN, and VeriSign collaborated to develop an interim approach for deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. On June 3, 2009, NTIA and NIST announced plans to work with ICANN and VeriSign to deploy DNSSEC in the root zone. NTIA filed a notice in the Federal Register on June 9, 2010, seeking public comments on DNSSEC implementation. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor on July 15, 2010, allowing for the signed root zone to be served by root operators. DNSSEC adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide is crucial for maximum protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. DNSSEC adoption is crucial for protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. WHOIS database information accessibility is debated by ICANN's GNSO. Privacy advocates argue for limited access, while businesses and government entities advocate for continued public availability. ICANN's GNSO debated the accessibility of WHOIS information, with privacy advocates supporting limited access and businesses advocating for continued public availability. The GNSO approved a narrow technical definition for the public display of WHOIS data, despite opposition from those favoring a more expansive definition. At ICANN's June 2006 meeting, opponents urged reconsideration of limiting access to WHOIS data. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy in October 2007 and rejected a proposal for third-party contact information. Currently, the GNSO is conducting extensive studies on WHOIS. In June 2011, ICANN initiated four separate studies on WHOIS recommended by the Governmental Advisory Committee. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) initiated studies on WHOIS misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and feasibility of a reveal study. A WHOIS policy review team made recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, including improving data accuracy and access. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data and consider safeguards. An Expert Working Group released recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service. On June 6, 2014, an Expert Working Group released recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace the current WHOIS system. ICANN is developing next steps for implementation. Domain name ownership has raised intellectual property concerns, leading to the adoption of a dispute resolution policy by ICANN in August 1999. ICANN adopted a dispute resolution policy in August 1999 for trademark/domain name disputes. Registrars must wait for instructions from the domain-name holder or a court/arbitrator before taking action. An exception is made for \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting, which is resolved through a special administrative procedure. The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy started on December 9, 1999. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed by the 106th Congress, giving courts the authority to order forfeiture. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, passed by the 106th Congress, allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith.\" It also provides for statutory civil damages ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name identifier. The addition of new generic top-level domain names by ICANN has sparked debate over intellectual property issues, with concerns about trademark protection and online piracy. The addition of new generic top-level domain names by ICANN has sparked debate over intellectual property issues, with concerns about trademark protection and online piracy. Industry groups, governments, and legislation like PROTECT IP and SOPA have raised concerns about the impact of new gTLDs on intellectual property rights and online piracy. The decisions made by ICANN regarding the DNS can have significant impacts on various Internet-related policy issues such as privacy, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Decisions made by ICANN regarding the DNS impact policy issues like intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The key question is how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair representation of the global Internet community. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have led to criticism of ICANN's policymaking process and suggestions for increased governmental influence. Some governments criticize ICANN's policymaking process and suggest increased governmental influence over it. They argue for a greater role in developing Internet policies that affect their citizens. Defenders of the multistakeholder model believe in a bottom-up, consensus approach to protect policy decisions from government control. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN to a multistakeholder-driven model. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN to a multistakeholder-driven model, assessing its impact on the United States and the Internet's stability, security, and openness. Congress will also monitor intergovernmental telecommunications conferences for potential increases in governmental control over the Internet. Congress will assess ongoing intergovernmental telecommunications conferences for potential increases in governmental control over the Internet. NTIA and other government agencies will work to counteract this threat, impacting the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
