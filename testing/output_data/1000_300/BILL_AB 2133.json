    "title": "AB 2133",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to ensure a safer environment for both providers and the children under their care. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they are not covered by workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them to receive training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to address these concerns. Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require the annual publication of lists of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes. The lists will include facility services, licensed capacity, and licensing information. The department will protect the privacy of small family day care homes by preventing the use of lists containing personal information. To protect the privacy of small family day care homes, the department will prevent the use of lists containing personal information, except for necessary licensing purposes and providing information to specific agencies and programs. The entity selected to provide trainings required under Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. They offer employee assistance program services, including child care referral services. Parents seeking local day care services can request names and telephone numbers of local small family day care providers. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, shall adopt regulations on the confidentiality of information for small family day care homes. Regulations include updating lists of licensed homes. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program exempt from licensing, excluding relatives of the children in care. A family child care provider under a publicly funded child care program must undergo a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession. The State Department of Social Services requires family child care providers to complete training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It also involves small and large group discussions and learning from child care professionals. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide training on chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, physical hazards, and stress for family child care providers. The training includes small and large group discussions, learning from current child care professionals, and feedback opportunities for providers. Organizations can also present relevant information on improving the child care system and offer training opportunities. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide occupational health and safety training for family child care providers. The entity must have experience in this training, train providers to educate others, and offer updates on health and safety. The selected entity will develop the training curriculum with input from providers and have it approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The State Department of Social Services administers the contract for training family child care providers. The training is coordinated with other requirements to reduce provider burden. Monthly lists of providers attending training are provided to the training entity for updates on health and safety issues. Providers can request removal of personal information from the lists. The department and training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section will be effective on July 1, 2017. Section 1 of the act, effective July 1, 2017, aims to codify the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints with the State Department of Education for violations of laws or regulations. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints if the program has not complied with laws or regulations. This includes programs like the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program. The enactment of an appropriation for this purpose is required for the operation of this section."
