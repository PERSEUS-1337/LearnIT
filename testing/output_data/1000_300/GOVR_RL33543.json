    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are a significant part of U.S. defense capability and spending. Efforts for modernization focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Air Force F-22 fighter, and Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. Congressional issues in FY2010 include decisions on the F-35 alternate engine program and ending F-22 procurement. In FY2010, decisions need to be made on the F-35 alternate engine program, ending F-22 procurement, and Navy's funding request for F/A-18E/F procurement. Congressional reports cover these program-specific issues in detail. In FY2010, decisions need to be made on the F-35 alternate engine program, ending F-22 procurement, and Navy's funding request for F/A-18E/F procurement. Congressional reports cover program-specific issues in detail, including the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. The overall affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft and the future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft are key issues. The key issue at hand is the future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft. Tactical aircraft are combat planes that can operate within a regional theater without in-flight refueling, while strategic aircraft like B-52 bombers are designed for longer-range missions. The distinction between tactical and strategic aircraft is important for understanding military capabilities. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are designed for missions within a single theater of operations. Fighters are for air-to-air combat, strike fighters are dual-role aircraft for air-to-ground and air-to-air operations, and attack planes are for air-to-ground operations. Tactical aircraft, including fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are versatile dual-role aircraft designed for air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. They operate from land bases and aircraft carriers, with some being VSTOL or STOVL aircraft. Their primary missions include air-to-air combat and establishing air superiority in a theater of operations. Corps tactical aircraft, such as VSTOL or STOVL aircraft, are used for various missions. Fighters focus on air-to-air combat for air superiority. Attack planes handle air-to-ground combat like close air support and interdiction. Strike fighters engage in both air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. They can also be used for surveillance and reconnaissance. The Air Force operates F-22 fighters and older aircraft like F-15 fighters and F-15E strike fighters. The Air Force operates new F-22 fighters and older aircraft types like F-15 and F-16 fighters, as well as A-10 attack aircraft. The Navy operates older F/A-18A-D strike fighters and newer F/A-18E/F strike fighters. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D strike fighters and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. In early 2009, the DOD had a total inventory of about 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force having about 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125 combined. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report in early 2009 revealed that the DOD had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force having 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having 1,125 combined. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), F-22 fighter, and F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. The F-35 JSF, known as the Lighting II, is being procured in different versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy to provide a cost-effective fifth-generation strike fighter option. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is procuring the F-35A as a replacement for the F-16s and A-10s, aiming for a more affordable complement to the new F-22s. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is procuring the F-35A as a replacement for the F-16s and A-10s, aiming for a more affordable complement to the new F-22s. Procurement of F-35s began in FY2007, with different versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and four F-35Cs for the Navy. The budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and four F-35Cs for the Navy. The administration did not request funding for additional F-22s in FY2010, aiming to end procurement at 187 aircraft. Supporters want to continue procuring F-22s towards a goal of 243 to 250 or more. The proposed FY2010 budget did not request funding for additional F-22s, but supporters aim to continue procurement towards a goal of 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter, considered a fourth-generation aircraft with some fifth-generation technology. The Navy has been procuring Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The Navy's aircraft carrier air wings rely heavily on Hornets and Super Hornets, with over 40 of the 70 aircraft in each wing being these models. The Navy has been acquiring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The proposed FY2010 budget included funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Both the Air Force and Navy have projected fighter aircraft shortfalls in the future, with the Air Force estimating up to 800 aircraft by 2024 and the Navy projecting a peak shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some observers question the Air Force's projections, citing assumptions about military threats and coalition involvement. The Air Force and Navy face projected fighter aircraft shortfalls in the future, with the Air Force estimating up to 800 aircraft by 2024 and the Navy projecting a peak shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Assumptions about military threats and coalition involvement influence these projections. The Air Force announced a plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft to generate savings for other program needs. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, in order to generate savings for other program needs. This plan aims to fund a smaller and more capable force and redistribute personnel for higher priority missions. The Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This will allow for a smaller, more flexible, and lethal force, with cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years. The goal is to transition to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and enhance capabilities needed for current operations. The Air Force's Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire older tactical aircraft to generate cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years. The funds will be used for advanced capability modifications to remaining fighters and bombers, procuring munitions for joint warfighters, and investing in critical intelligence capabilities and enabling technologies for tactical air controllers and special operations forces. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the careful assessment of current threat environment and capabilities before making this decision. The Air Force's Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire older tactical aircraft to generate cost savings and invest in advanced capabilities for remaining fighters and bombers. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the need for modernization to maintain the Air Force's advantage over potential adversaries. The plan includes reassigning manpower to emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence operations. The Air Force plans to reassign manpower to emerging missions such as surveillance and nuclear deterrence operations. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 Stratofortress squadron, and enhancing information processing capabilities for combatant commander support in Afghanistan and Iraq. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the Air Force's nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. The goal is to have a force mix that meets current mission requirements while preparing for future challenges. The Air Force plans to reinvigorate its nuclear enterprise and deploy 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. Secretary Donley emphasizes the need for a force mix that meets current and future mission requirements. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft, with potential budget challenges ahead. The affordability of tactical aircraft modernization, particularly the F-35 program, is a concern as production of other aircraft winds down. DOD plans to increase F-35 procurement rates, but has reduced the number of new aircraft acquired since the 1990s. Since the early 1990s, DOD has reduced the planned number of new aircraft for tactical aircraft modernization to lower costs. This reduction was due to post-Cold War cuts in Air Force and Navy air wings, as well as the Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan. The F-35 program is another initiative to reduce costs by developing a versatile strike fighter. The F-35 program is a major DOD initiative to reduce costs for tactical aircraft modernization by acquiring a versatile strike fighter. However, there are concerns about the affordability of DOD's modernization plans due to potential budget constraints and projected fighter shortfalls for the Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps. The strike fighter shortfall may indicate challenges in funding tactical aircraft modernization. Policymakers may need to choose between funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs or non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. This decision could also involve tradeoffs with funding for other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters. Funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs may need to be balanced against funding for long-range aircraft due to evolving anti-access capabilities. This decision also involves tradeoffs with funding for other aircraft intended for different missions. The affordability of DOD's plans for procuring new aircraft of all types, including tactical aircraft, UAVs, and UCAVs, is a key concern. DOD plans to increase emphasis on UAVs and UCAVs for surveillance, reconnaissance, and ground-attack operations, particularly for precision attacks on terrorist targets. The DOD plans to increase emphasis on UAVs and UCAVs for ground-attack operations, particularly for precision attacks on terrorist targets. Funding debates exist between land-based Air Force tactical aircraft and sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft acquisition programs. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A, raising debates on funding for different tactical aircraft models like F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or new upgraded models of older-design tactical aircraft. Examples include upgraded F-15s instead of more F-22s, upgraded F-16s instead of some F-35As, and additional F/A-18E/Fs instead of some F-35Cs and Bs. The curr_chunk discusses potential tradeoffs in acquiring new or upgraded models of tactical aircraft, such as upgraded F-15s, F-16s, additional F/A-18E/Fs, and service life extensions of older F/A-18A-Ds. These tradeoffs raise questions of costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility, which have been extensively studied in the context of U.S. military goals and objectives. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is currently reviewing U.S. military goals, with a key issue being the emphasis on preparing for future challenges. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is reviewing U.S. military goals, focusing on preparing for irregular warfare operations vs. conventional conflict. Some suggest reducing high-capability tactical aircraft procurement for more cost-effective options. Some argue against high-cost tactical aircraft for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations, favoring investments in UAVs, special operations helicopters, and forward air controllers. Others believe high-capability aircraft are still needed due to potential threats from Russian and other countries with advanced aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. The end of the Cold War did not diminish the need for advanced aircraft in high-threat areas. Concerns have been raised about China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs, potentially challenging U.S. airpower. The Government Accountability Office examined DOD's investment planning for modernizing its tactical aircraft force portfolio. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for recapitalizing and modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio. The military services plan to spend about $109.3 billion in the next 7 years to acquire new tactical aircraft and modernize operational aircraft. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The F-22A development period doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has declined. Similar conditions and risks are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is facing similar challenges as the F-22A, with development costs increasing by $31.6 billion since 2004 and procurement schedules slipping. Funding for new and legacy aircraft is interdependent, with legacy systems needing to be sustained until new systems are ready. If new aircraft quantities are reduced or deliveries delayed, more unplanned money will be needed to maintain and modernize legacy systems. The services are investing about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but there are billions more in unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon, as DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan. The Department of Defense (DOD) is facing hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft as it lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Each military service operates independently to fill its force structure construct, leading to underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs. The military services have underperformed in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels due to unrealistic assumptions about new acquisitions and funding levels. The military services have struggled to deliver aircraft within budget and quantity targets. The decline in federal discretionary spending, ongoing support for the global war on terror, and upcoming defense projects are all competing for the same funds. The Government Accountability Office recommends that the Department of Defense take action to expedite the development and delivery of new tactical aircraft and create an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2009 plans. They recommended that the DOD shorten cycle times for developing new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study comparing alternative approaches for modernizing the fighter forces of the Department of Defense. The report highlighted the potential increase in capability with modernized fleets equipped with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and greater stealth capabilities. The modernized fleets of the Department of Defense would have state-of-the-art aircraft with increased payload capacity and greater stealth capabilities, enhancing survivability. Despite plans for fighter procurement in fiscal year 2009, inventories may fall below goals. However, aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to the enhanced lethality and survivability of the new fighters, although potential adversaries' increased capabilities could offset some of these improvements. The new fighters are expected to enhance lethality and survivability, but potential adversaries' capabilities could offset some improvements. Purchasing alternative aircraft like F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could offer short-term relief and cost savings, albeit with lesser capability improvements. Forces with a mix of supersonic fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would provide improved capabilities. Forces equipped with a mix of supersonic fighters and subsonic attack aircraft offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft could maintain air-to-ground weapons capacities at similar costs. However, this would result in fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Congressional decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs by Congress can impact the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry, affecting workloads, revenues, and employment levels. The industry currently has two active prime contractors, Lockheed and Boeing, but production winding down could reduce this to one contractor. This could have implications for the industry's structure and employment. The U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry currently has two active prime contractors, Lockheed and Boeing. However, with production winding down for certain aircraft, the number of prime contractors may be reduced to one (Lockheed). Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on competition, innovation, pricing, schedule adherence, and production quality in the future development and procurement of tactical aircraft. Congress may need to consider how many prime contractors are needed to support military needs, the value of competition at the prime contractor level, and the potential for firms like Boeing to leverage their experience in designing and building other aircraft. The section discusses legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization and the potential impact on U.S. export earnings and aerospace industry competitiveness. It also raises questions about the value of competition at the prime contractor level and the skills needed for future competition between Boeing and Lockheed. Section 133 of H.R. 2647 requires DOD to report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must detail the number of these aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 to maintain the Air Force's requirement of 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft. The report on aircraft procurement must include the number of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011-2025 to maintain the Air Force's requirement of 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft. It should also cover estimated procurement costs for single and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear procurement. Availability and feasibility of F-35s should also be discussed. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear procurement contracts for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft. It also includes a discussion on the availability and feasibility of F-35s from 2015 to 2025 for Air National Guard recapitalization. Additionally, it mentions the Secretary's recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for these aircraft. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including advanced capabilities and armaments. It also mentions the requirement for a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects analyses on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, focusing on factors influencing fighter force structure decisions for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, including threat capabilities, modeling simulations, unmanned aerial vehicle inventories, operational risks, and measures to address them. Section 1047 of the report prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until 90 days after submitting a report on the combat air forces restructuring plan. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring any fighter aircraft or reassigning Air Force personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. Additionally, a minimum of $344,600,000 must be allocated for the operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. At least $344,600,000 must be allocated for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Additionally, $10,500,000 should be available for necessary modifications to sustain these aircraft. A detailed report outlining plans to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement actions must be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services. A detailed plan is required to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from fighter aircraft retirements in fiscal year 2010. The plan should include assessments of the current threat environment, follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding needs for fiscal years 2010-2015. A detailed plan is needed to address force structure and capability gaps due to fighter aircraft retirements in fiscal year 2010. The plan should include assessments of the current threat environment, follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding needs for fiscal years 2010-2015. Additionally, there is an exception for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Congress also expresses its sense regarding Navy carrier air wing force structure. Congress expresses its sense regarding Navy carrier air wing force structure, emphasizing the need for not less than 10 carrier air wings with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft each, despite the limited deployment of fifth-generation assets. The House Armed Services Committee report emphasizes the need for not less than 10 carrier air wings with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft each in the Navy, despite limited deployment of fifth-generation assets. The House Armed Services Committee report highlights concerns about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. This could result in gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still in testing and not yet available for deployment. The House Armed Services Committee report raises concerns about the Air Force's decision to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s. The committee is worried about potential gaps in force structure and capability since replacement aircraft are still being tested and not ready for deployment. Additionally, the committee has identified $344.6 million in unjustified program growth and unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget. The committee recommends using $200.9 million for the operation and maintenance of 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement. $10.5 million is also recommended for necessary aircraft modifications. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft starting in fiscal year 2017. The Department of the Air Force has informed Congress of the need for 2,200 fighter aircraft, projecting a shortfall of around 800 aircraft by 2024. This shortage could impact the ability of active duty and reserve forces to meet future mission requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report to Congress by March 1, 2010, including input from the Chief of the Air National Guard and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve. The Air Force Reserve must provide a report to Congress by March 1, 2010, addressing the \"fighter gap\" issue. This report should include input from the Chief of the Air National Guard and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve, discussing solutions like accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, interim procurement of \"4.5 generation\" fighters, and fleet management options. The report must analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission, including potential loss of flying missions and pilot and maintenance capability. The report expresses concern about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. The committee finds such drastic shortfalls unacceptable due to the impact on pilot and maintenance capability. The committee is concerned about the potential peak strike-fighter shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to this shortfall include decisions to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory and delays in the F-35B/C program. The committee remains unconvinced that naval strike-fighter shortfalls should be viewed in isolation from the Department of Defense's overall inventory. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall. They believe that a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than other options. The provision in the Act authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a multi-year contract for additional aircraft. The committee supports a provision in the Act authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a multi-year procurement contract for additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft. Additionally, there is a sense of Congress that the Department of the Navy should maintain at least ten carrier air wings with no less than 44 strike-fighters each. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report on the F/A-18E/F program highlights concerns about the Navy facing a shortfall in aircraft inventory due to the retirement of older F/A-18A-D Hornets before the F-35C variant of the Joint Strike Fighter is available. The report recommends evaluating the operational effectiveness and costs of extending the service-life of existing aircraft versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Navy is concerned about a gap in aircraft inventory as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant of the Joint Strike Fighter is available. The Senate committee is disappointed with the Navy's failure to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs. Last year, the Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which increases to 125 when considering Marine Corps requirements. The Navy projected a shortfall in tactical aviation, with a potential gap of up to 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. The committee is concerned about the Navy's budget not addressing this increased shortfall and the potential national security risks it poses. The committee is concerned about the Department of the Navy's substantial shortfall in its tactical air fleet and the potential national security risks. The Navy's delay in addressing the shortfall raises concerns about security risks, reliance on costly service life extension programs, and lack of realistic procurement plans. The committee is concerned about the Navy's reliance on costly service life extension programs for legacy F/A-18 aircraft, with uncertainties about reaching 10,000 flight hours and the associated costs. The committee is concerned about the Navy's costly service life extension programs for legacy F/A-18 aircraft. Uncertainties exist about reaching 10,000 flight hours and the associated costs. The committee believes that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more efficient than extending the service life of existing planes. The committee believes that the Navy should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft versus investing in a service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities such as radar, avionics, aerial refueling, and weapon hard points, which would not be included in a SLEP upgrade for older aircraft. The cost per flight hour for new F/A-18E/Fs is higher initially but decreases over time, making them potentially more cost-effective in the long run. The Navy should evaluate the benefits of purchasing new F/A-18E/F aircraft over investing in a service life extension program for older aircraft. New models offer advanced avionics, aerial refueling capabilities, and additional weapon hard points. The Navy projects the F/A-18E/F to remain in the fleet until 2040 and expects the Department of Defense to review tactical aircraft forces in the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. The Department should analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, comparing cost differences between single-year and multiyear strategies, and weighing the tradeoffs between SLEP upgrades and new procurements. The Department of Defense is directed to analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, comparing cost differences between single-year and multiyear strategies, and weighing tradeoffs between SLEP upgrades and new procurements. This analysis should inform tactical aviation procurement strategies in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Additional actions to address the strike-fighter shortfall should not be delayed. (Pages 20-22) The conference version of H.R. 2647 requires the Department of Defense to submit a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft. The report should include factors that informed decisions on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Additionally, the Air Force is prohibited from retiring fighter aircraft until 30 days after submitting the report. Section 131 of H.R. 2647 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days. The report should detail the number of aircraft needed for the Air Force to maintain a minimum of 2,200 tactical fighters from 2011 to 2025. The report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft must include the number needed to maintain 2,200 tactical fighters from 2011 to 2025, estimated procurement costs for annual and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft must include the number needed to maintain 2,200 tactical fighters from 2011 to 2025, estimated procurement costs for annual and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. It also defines 4.5 generation fighter aircraft and discusses the availability and feasibility of procuring F-35 aircraft for the Air National Guard. The report on the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review must include analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in minimum military requirements for major military capabilities. The term \"major military capabilities\" encompasses any capability deemed significant by the Secretary of Defense. The 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review report must include analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in minimum military requirements for major military capabilities, which are defined as significant capabilities by the Secretary of Defense. Section 1075 outlines limitations related to legacy aircraft retirement, prohibiting the Secretary of the Air Force from retiring any fighter aircraft as part of the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring any fighter aircraft or reassigning personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan. A detailed report must be submitted to Congress addressing force structure, capability gaps, threat assessment, and follow-on missions. The Secretary of the Air Force must submit a detailed report to Congress addressing force structure, capability gaps, threat assessment, follow-on missions, criteria for base selection, environmental analyses, personnel reassignment, funding needs, and cost avoidance estimates. The Secretary of the Air Force must submit a detailed report to Congress addressing force structure, capability gaps, threat assessment, follow-on missions, criteria for base selection, environmental analyses, personnel reassignment, funding needs, and cost avoidance estimates. The report should include a description of funding needed in fiscal years 2010 through 2015 for operation and maintenance costs, personnel, and aircraft procurement if the restructuring plan is not carried out. It should also estimate the cost avoidance and describe how funds would be invested to ensure the remaining fighter force achieves the desired service life and is sufficiently modernized to outpace threats. The prohibition on fighter aircraft retirement in fiscal year 2010 does not apply to five aircraft scheduled for retirement as announced in the fiscal year 2009 budget. The Navy is required to maintain 11 operational aircraft carriers and 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing. Congress believes the Navy should meet the requirement for 10 carrier air wings even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The Navy is required to maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft each, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should ensure this requirement is met until modifications to the carrier air wing force structure are justified. The conference report discusses the Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force. It suggests analyzing the viability of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract and submitting a proposal to Congress if conditions are met. The conferees intend for the Air Force to analyze the potential for a multiyear purchase of advanced 4.5 generation fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities. This provision does not alter existing procurement requirements under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about the Air Force's plan to retire legacy aircraft. They are worried about the restructuring plan's implementation, personnel costs, and potential acquisition costs. The Committee requested a cost benefit analysis of the proposal for Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about the Air Force's plan to retire legacy aircraft and requested a cost benefit analysis for relocating F-15 training from Tyndall Air Force Base to Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The analysis will include factors impacting training quantity and quality, establishment of training programs, simulator access, instructor base quality, military construction requirements, and special considerations for differing training environments. The Committee requests analysis on simulator and ancillary training access, impact on instructor base quality, future military construction requirements, and special considerations and costs due to varying training environments. They also ask for identification of airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations, along with an independent review on the impact of the restructure on combat air forces. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide reports no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act. The Committee requests analysis on the impact of the restructure on combat air forces, specifically addressing the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide reports no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act. The Navy's aircraft fleet, mainly the F-18 variant, is aging faster than planned due to high operational tempo. This has led to critical shortfalls in strike fighter inventory, with over 200 aircraft now predicted to be affected. Delays in the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter have worsened the situation. The Navy is facing a shortfall of over 200 aircraft, mainly due to issues with the life extension of older F-18 variants and reduced purchases in fiscal year 2010. Despite this, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft.
