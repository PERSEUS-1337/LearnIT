    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with higher scrutiny for more suspect classifications. This increases the likelihood of a court finding the action unconstitutional. The level of scrutiny in evaluating government actions is determined by the motivation behind the classification, with three main levels: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Strict scrutiny is the most rigorous and applies to classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Courts consider historical discrimination, minority status with unchangeable characteristics, or inadequate political protection to determine suspect classifications. Governmental classifications can be subject to strict scrutiny if they are based on race, national origin, or alienage. Strict scrutiny requires that the government prove its actions are narrowly tailored to a compelling interest and cannot be achieved through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny, which is less rigorous than strict scrutiny but more stringent than rational basis review, applies to classifications like gender. Intermediate scrutiny is less searching than strict scrutiny but more stringent than rational basis review. It applies to classifications based on gender or illegitimacy, requiring that governmental action be substantially related to achieving an important government interest. The government must establish the constitutional validity of its actions under intermediate scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny, where governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive. Rational basis review is a deferential form of judicial scrutiny that applies to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. Governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive this review. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and parties challenging governmental actions bear the burden of establishing their case. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, with parties challenging actions bearing the burden of proof. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, ensuring no deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process. The Fifth Amendment applies to actions by the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action. Due process prohibits the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following certain procedures. Substantive due process also protects against undue governmental infringement on fundamental rights, which are subject to strict scrutiny and must be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions that infringe upon fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must show a substantial need for its action to further this interest without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. If alternative actions could have been less burdensome on rights while achieving the same goal, the government's action is not considered narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions that infringe upon fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court ruled that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states, based on due process and equal protection principles. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court found state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, citing due process and equal protection principles. The decision was based on the fundamental right to marry, which includes personal choice, support for committed unions, and safeguarding children. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing personal choice, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and the importance of marriage in the nation's social order. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights, stating that rights are not solely based on historical practices but also on a modern understanding of constitutional imperatives. The Court found that the fundamental right to marry includes same-sex couples, but did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent by not applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court did not address whether the bans were narrowly tailored to the states' justifications, invalidating those reasons. The Court invalidated state same-sex marriage bans, stating that equal protection and due process guarantees protect the right to marry for same-sex couples. The Court did not specify the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the majority overstepped by deciding on same-sex marriage outside of the democratic process. They criticized the majority for not considering tradition and history in establishing a fundamental right. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell criticized the majority for not considering tradition and history in establishing a fundamental right, aiming to prevent the Court from imposing its policy decisions. The Supreme Court's decision on state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on gay individuals' rights, judicial scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications, implications for laws on plural marriages, and the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights. The Obergefell decision raised questions about its impact on gay individuals' rights outside of marriage, but the ruling seems limited to the marriage context. The Court did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny. The Obergefell decision did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, which could have broader implications for the rights of gay individuals. Prior to this decision, federal appeals courts were divided on the level of scrutiny applicable to such classifications. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth and Second Circuits apply heightened scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit only uses rational basis review. The Obergefell decision focused on the right to marry and did not clarify the level of scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications. The Obergefell decision did not clarify the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, leaving a circuit split between the Second, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits. This ambiguity could lead to different levels of scrutiny being applied by circuit courts in the future. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the fundamental right to marry to polygamy, creating potential disparities in outcomes for laws based on sexual orientation depending on the evaluating court. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the fundamental right to marry to polygamy. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that the legalization of plural marriages could result from the majority's opinion. However, the majority's opinion seems crafted to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, preventing the extension of the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The majority in Obergefell found that the right to marry is fundamental for same-sex couples, based on four reasons. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples based on four reasons. While some believe this rationale may not apply to plural marriages, others argue that aspects of the opinion could potentially support constitutional protections for plural marriages. The Court's departure from traditional methods of determining fundamental rights raises the possibility of future expansions in this area. The Obergefell decision departed from precedent by considering current views in addition to historical recognition when determining fundamental rights. This could lead to an expansion of rights protected under substantive due process. The Court did not specify the level of judicial review for state same-sex marriage bans, raising questions about future scrutiny of government actions infringing on rights. The Obergefell decision departed from precedent by considering current views in addition to historical recognition when determining fundamental rights, leading to questions about the level of judicial scrutiny for state same-sex marriage bans. This raises ambiguity regarding government actions infringing on fundamental rights."
