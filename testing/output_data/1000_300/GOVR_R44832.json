    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid rise in retail drug spending. Factors contributing to this increase include the introduction of new drugs at higher prices, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection, and a forecasted 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. Despite efforts to reduce growth rates, retail drug spending is expected to outpace other areas of medical spending in the next decade. Retail drug spending is projected to increase faster than other medical spending areas from 2017 to 2026, despite a reduction in growth rate. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including research funding, advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. Data on prescription drug spending is sourced from the National Health Expenditures accounts compiled by CMS. According to the National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts compiled by CMS, the United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of predicted national health care spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to about 11% of national health care spending by 2027. Retail drug spending ranges from 5% to 10% of total health care spending. Prescription drug spending in the United States is forecasted to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national health care spending. By 2027, it is expected to rise to about 11% of total health care expenditures. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% since 1960, but some analysts believe this data does not provide a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the decades, with growth rates fluctuating. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, spending grew rapidly, but slowed down from 2003 to 2013. Various studies show a trend towards higher spending in recent years, influenced by factors like rebates from manufacturers and coupons for consumers. Retail drug spending in the U.S. experienced rapid growth from the 1980s to the early 2000s, but slowed down significantly from 2003 to 2013. Factors such as the economic recession, fewer expensive new drugs, and increased use of generic drugs contributed to this slowdown. However, in 2014, spending accelerated with a 12.4% increase, the largest in over a decade. Subsequent years saw varying growth rates, with a forecasted average annual growth of 6.3% through 2027. Drug spending rose by 8.9% in 2015, slowed to 1.3% in 2016, and is forecasted to increase by 2.9% in 2017. Retail drug spending is projected to grow by 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than physician services and hospital care. Congressional hearings have been held on prescription drugs due to the rise in spending and prices. During the 114th and 115th Congresses, hearings were held on prescription drugs in response to increased spending and price hikes. Factors affecting retail drug spending include changes in drug availability, prices, and usage. The rise in drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was due to new high-cost drugs, price increases, and fewer generic substitutions. The implementation of the ACA also boosted drug demand. Spending slowed in 2016 despite increased utilization. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to factors like fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost drugs, and a deceleration in spending for diabetes treatments. Drug mix, which compares the cost of new versus older drugs, can impact overall spending. The FDA has approved many new expensive specialty drugs in recent years. The FDA has approved many new expensive specialty drugs in recent years, including drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. New generic drugs can reduce therapy costs, and the introduction of hepatitis C drugs has played a significant role in increased drug spending. The impact of expensive new drugs like hepatitis C drugs on drug spending is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated and net prices drop. Generic substitution played a smaller role in reducing total drug spending since 2009 when patents for best-selling brand-name drugs expired. Changes in drug mix, including the rise of biologics in the development pipeline, will continue to impact spending going forward. Annual savings from brands losing patent protection has decreased, with changes in drug mix impacting future spending. Biologics in development have high prices initially, with FDA approving biosimilar substitutes. Prescription drug prices have outpaced overall inflation since 2014, but the gap narrowed in 2017. Retail drug inflation was 6.4% in 2014 compared to general consumer inflation. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017. U.S. retail drug inflation, as measured by the CPI-U, was 6.4% in 2014, compared to general consumer inflation of 0.8%. Drug prices rose 6.2% in 2016, compared to a 2.1% consumer inflation rate, and 2.8% in 2017, compared to consumer inflation of 2.1%. Drug inflation has been mainly driven by price increases for existing brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator brand-name drugs. Manufacturers have also raised prices for existing generic drugs in recent years. The 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7%. Biologics and specialty drugs drove much of the price inflation. ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage boosted demand. ACA provided tax credits for health plans and required coverage of prescription drugs as essential benefits. ACA exchanges saw a 15% annual increase in drug spending. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage led to a 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers. Medicaid coverage also expanded under the ACA, contributing to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging of the baby boomers has also increased demand for prescription drugs, with patients aged 50 and older accounting for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. The demand for prescription drugs has increased, with patients aged 50 and older accounting for a significant portion of dispensed prescriptions. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs covering a larger share of the costs. By 2026, out-of-pocket spending is projected to only account for 12.1% of retail drug costs. Out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs declined to 13.2% of drug spending in 2017, with commercial payers covering 86.2%. By 2026, out-of-pocket spending is forecasted to be 12.1% of retail drug costs. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending, with drug deductibles rising from 23% to 46% from 2012 to 2015. The share of commercial health plans with prescription drug deductibles rose from 23% to 46% between 2012 and 2015. Formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs have become more common, increasing the financial burden on consumers. For example, in 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers had an average co-payment of $110 for high-priced drugs. The widening of health plan price tiers has increased the financial burden on consumers using higher-priced drugs. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers had an average co-payment of $110 for tier-four drugs, compared to $11 for generic drugs. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by the ACA's cap on annual out-of-pocket spending and expanded patient assistance programs from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Generic drug use rates have also continued to rise. The average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased in recent years, but the number of consumers facing high costs has increased. A study found that while average out-of-pocket spending dropped to $144 in 2014, nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000, accounting for a third of drug spending. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004. Out-of-pocket costs for retail prescription drugs have decreased on average, but the number of consumers facing high costs has increased. Nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014, accounting for a third of drug spending. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004. Median out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rose from $24 to $35 per month from 2003 to 2014. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs is forecasted to gradually increase to $207 by 2026. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs decreased from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, forecasted to dip to $137 in 2017 before gradually increasing to $207 by 2026. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending rose from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, projected to reach 47% by 2026. Unlike other nations, the U.S. lacks a centralized system for drug coverage. The government's share of drug spending in the U.S. rose from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, with a forecasted increase to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits or setting drug prices. Various federal departments and agencies operate different drug discount and contracting systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D and direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration. FDA regulates drug safety and effectiveness but does not have the authority to set drug prices. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, but does not have the authority to set drug prices. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, with Medicaid rebates equaling 47% of Medicaid spending in 2012. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs including Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. Part D is a market-oriented program where plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers. Health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage price and scope. Part D plan sponsors negotiate rebates and discounts with manufacturers and contract with pharmacies. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations. Congress debates the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget. In the years since Part D was enacted, Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with total Part D drug rebates forecasted to rise to 24% in 2018. Studies have shown that Part D plans have higher average drug prices compared to Medicaid, which secures lower drug prices. Some lawmakers propose modifying the noninterference provision to allow the Secretary to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, leveraging their combined purchasing power for larger discounts. In 2007, the House approved a bill for the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices, but it was not approved by the Senate. A CBO analysis stated that significant savings would only be achieved if the Secretary could also create a central formulary and set prices. The Senate did not approve a measure in 2007 that would have allowed the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices without crafting a formulary. A CBO analysis indicated that significant savings would only be possible if the Secretary had the authority to create a central formulary, set prices administratively, or take regulatory actions against firms not offering price reductions. Patient and consumer groups have opposed giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary, fearing potential reductions in drug coverage. Lawmakers have introduced various bills to modify the noninterference provision, with the Obama Administration recommending negotiation authority for high-cost and biologic drugs in Medicare Part D. The Trump Administration has suggested additional approaches, such as requiring changes to Part D. The Obama Administration recommended giving the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for high-cost and biologic drugs in Medicare Part D. The Trump Administration proposed requiring Part D plans to pass on more negotiated drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's mandatory rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, which could lower costs initially but may lead to price increases over time. State governments are actively regulating prescription drug use and pricing, with some offering patient assistance programs for low-income residents. Various approaches are being used to limit spending on high-priced drugs and increase transparency in drug prices. For example, a 2015 California statute sets a $250 cap on cost sharing for a 30-day supply of drugs for individual enrollees. State governments are implementing laws to address prescription drug spending and access, such as setting caps on cost sharing and requiring transparency in drug prices. Vermont passed a law in 2016 that mandates manufacturers to disclose drugs with significant price increases, with regulators compiling a list of drugs experiencing large price hikes. This legislation aims to make drug companies justify their prices based on costs. The Vermont act and similar bills aim to make drug companies justify prices based on costs. Some states are also passing laws to prohibit gag clauses in pharmacy contracts and allow importation of prescription drugs from other countries. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, higher than any other industrialized nation. Large price differences for specific drugs exist between the U.S. and other countries. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. Large price differences for specific drugs exist between the U.S. and other countries, with reasons including faster adoption of breakthrough drugs in the U.S. and government-run health care systems in OECD countries setting price limits. The OECD countries may operate government-run health care systems that set price limits for drugs. Most EU nations use external reference pricing to derive benchmark prices. National health programs may use value-based pricing. In Canada, the Common Drug Review assesses new drugs for effectiveness. U.S. government and commercial payers are experimenting with alternative pricing models. The assessments of new drugs for effectiveness are passed on to government drug plans for reimbursement. U.S. payers are exploring alternative pricing models, such as value-based purchasing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review produces reports on the cost-effectiveness of newly approved drugs, causing concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. ICER, a private research organization, produces public reports on the effectiveness and cost of new FDA-approved drugs, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry about limiting reimbursement and patient access. The organization has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs and engages with various healthcare sectors. The federal government focuses on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery. The pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery, making it challenging to assign credit for therapeutic advancements. Studies show that a small percentage of new drugs originate from publicly funded research, with the majority coming from private industry. Between 1990 and 1999, only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA came from sources other than private industry. A study in 2010 revealed that 24.1% of innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs), originated from publicly funded research between 1998 and 2007. Another study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 provided a more comprehensive analysis of the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs. The study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Additionally, 19% of drugs that received priority review were from publicly funded research, showing a significant contribution from public-sector research institutions. The FDA designation of priority review is for evaluating drug applications that would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of treatment for serious conditions. Data suggests that Public-Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. PSRIs play a role in the applied research phase leading to drug discovery by creating intellectual property transferred to companies through commercial licenses. The Stevens study methodology excludes the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies contributing to drug discovery. The Stevens study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that contributed to the development of new drug classes approved by the FDA. Platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and production methods for antibodies, were excluded from the study. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, including recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods. Public funding was found to contribute to every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016, impacting the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook significantly. The study found that NIH funding was associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016, with up to 29% of publications directly linked to NIH-funded projects. The analysis included basic and applied research on new drug approvals, indicating that NIH's contribution to research in this area is greater than previously recognized. The NIH's contribution to research associated with new drug approvals is greater than previously appreciated. Detailed information about the cost of developing specific drugs is generally not available, but academic studies have attempted to estimate average spending. The most cited study by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development uses data from large drug manufacturers to estimate average spending for clinical research on new drugs and the time costs of development. According to a 2014 Tufts estimate, the pretax cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug is significant. The cost of developing new drugs, including clinical spending and time costs, is estimated to be $2.6 billion according to a 2014 Tufts study. However, academic and government research has raised questions about the study's assumptions and methodology. The study raises questions about drug companies needing a 10.5% rate of return for capital during drug development, the mix of drugs sampled, and the impact of federal tax breaks. Estimates for new drug development range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are sensitive to factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs. Transparency legislation may compel drugmakers to disclose data on research and marketing costs for high-priced drugs. Price transparency legislation being debated in Congress and state legislatures would require drugmakers to provide data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Studies show that research cost is not the main factor in drug pricing, as seen in the case of Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Gilead's pricing strategy focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. Gilead's pricing strategy for its hepatitis C drugs focused on maximizing revenue rather than research costs. Pfizer's pricing strategy for Ibrance considered existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The US allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA for accuracy and balance. The US and New Zealand allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses from their taxes. Pharmaceutical firms also market to healthcare providers through various channels. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when FDA gained authority over prescription drug advertising. In 1999, FDA issued guidance on broadcast ads, and since then has updated guidance on issues like internet advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising reached over $5 billion in 2006, dipped during the 2007 recession, and rebounded around 2014. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily increased over the years, reaching over $6 billion in 2015. Internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area of promotion, with television and newspaper ads still accounting for the majority of spending. Internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area of DTC promotion, with federal regulations requiring drug companies to submit ads to the FDA for assessment. The number of internet prescription drug promotions is increasing, while television promotions remain flat. Pharmaceutical advertising aims to inform consumers and encourage them to be more involved in their treatment. Critics and supporters have differing views on pharmaceutical advertising. Supporters believe it leads to more informed consumers who are more involved in their treatment, resulting in better diagnosis of undertreated illnesses. However, critics argue that the industry's presentation of drug benefits and risks may lead to inappropriate prescribing and increased drug spending. Additionally, advertising for new brand-name drugs with higher prices may lead to consumers choosing them over lower-priced options, without clear evidence of their effectiveness or safety compared to existing treatments. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs. A 2015 study found that a 10% rise in drug advertising views leads to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. Government reports have shown that advertising may encourage the use of specific drugs, even if alternatives may be more appropriate. A government survey revealed that many people feel DTC advertisements lack sufficient information about the benefits and risks of the drugs. Congress has discussed potential restrictions on DTC drug advertising. The government survey found that many people believe DTC drug advertisements lack sufficient information about benefits and risks. Congress has debated restricting DTC drug advertising, with concerns about public health and unnecessary spending. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, raising constitutional issues regarding commercial speech. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, raising constitutional issues regarding commercial speech. Kantar data shows manufacturers are focusing ad dollars on newly introduced products, sparking concerns about promoting drugs before long-term safety and effectiveness evidence is available. Previous debates in Congress include recommendations to restrict DTC advertising of new drugs and disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. The FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States, requiring an approved marketing application with clinical data on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing procedures, and labeling. Without approval, a manufacturer cannot sell a drug in the U.S. market. The detailed requirements mean that no imported drug would technically meet all approval elements. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical sales in the U.S. with detailed requirements for safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and packaging. Imported drugs may not meet all approval elements, and only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved drug can legally bring it back into the U.S. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (MEDS Act) of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, importation has not been allowed. The act required certification from the HHS Secretary to ensure no additional risk to public health and a reduction in costs to consumers. This provision was revised in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003. The MEDS Act provision in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003 aimed to reduce costs for American consumers by allowing importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs. However, this provision has never been implemented due to the lack of necessary certifications from the HHS Secretary. If enacted, companies could manufacture drugs abroad according to FDA standards and bring them into the US for sale. A company could produce and package a drug outside the United States according to FDA approval and bring it into the US for sale. Lawmakers have attempted to bypass restrictions on drug importation through the agriculture appropriations bill. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring in a small amount of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring in a small amount of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. Individuals must affirm in writing that the drugs are for their own use and provide their treating physician's name and address. The intent of the personal use importation guidance is to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not otherwise available in the US. The FDA's leniency in enforcing personal importation restrictions allows individuals to bring in non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, with the intent to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not available in the US. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation. Some states have attempted to enact laws allowing prescription drug importation to address drug costs. Senate committees have also discussed issues related to generic drug marketplace, Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model, and sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs. The Senate committees have discussed sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs and the proposed Medicare Part B Drug Demonstration. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has examined the cost of prescription drugs in various hearings. The focus has been on how the drug delivery system impacts what patients pay. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has held hearings on the cost of prescription drugs, focusing on how the drug delivery system affects patient payments. The hearings include topics such as EpiPen price increases, regulatory barriers to pharmaceutical competition, and accelerating patient access to generic drugs. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has held hearings on various topics related to prescription drugs, including EpiPen price increases, regulatory barriers to pharmaceutical competition, and accelerating patient access to generic drugs. Hearings have also covered biosimilar implementation, research and development for patients, the drug supply chain, and the utilization of the 340B Drug Pricing Program by covered entities. The Energy and Commerce Committee has conducted hearings on various topics related to prescription drugs, including the drug supply chain, utilization of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, patient access to investigational drugs, modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs, and examining FDA's Prescription Drug User Fee Program.
