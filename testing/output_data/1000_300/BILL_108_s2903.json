    "content": "The Act titled \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are crucial for youth development, promoting skills like leadership and teamwork. Nonprofit organizations strive to prioritize the well-being of young athletes, despite the inherent risks of injuries in sports. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Participation in school sports and other amateur competitions benefits young people by reducing obesity levels, promoting fitness in adulthood, and providing age-appropriate competition through necessary playing rules. Sports involve physical activity and some risk, requiring clear rules to ensure safety and fair play. Rules makers in amateur sports face increasing lawsuits for negligence in rule development. Allowing such lawsuits based on good faith rule-making is deemed unfair and detrimental to the provision of sports services. Failure to adopt specific rules for amateur sports can have a negative impact on the ability of rules makers to provide services and may discourage top coaches, officials, and administrators from participating in rules committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"economic loss\" refers to pecuniary loss resulting from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, and loss of business opportunities. \"Harm\" includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. \"Noneconomic loss\" encompasses physical and emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. Nonpecuniary losses include inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, injury to reputation, and other nonpecuniary losses. Nonprofit organizations are described as those exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or organized for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. A nonprofit athletic organization is a nonprofit organization primarily focused on adopting rules for athletic competitions. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection is granted to nonprofit athletic organizations for harm caused by their acts or omissions in adopting rules for sanctioned competitions or practices, as long as they were acting within their duties, properly licensed, and the harm was not due to willful misconduct or negligence. Liability protection is granted to nonprofit athletic organizations for harm caused by their acts or omissions in sanctioned competitions or practices, as long as the harm was not caused by willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. Employees, agents, and volunteers of nonprofit athletic organizations are not affected by this protection. Exceptions to this liability protection may apply if state laws impose certain conditions. Nonprofit athletic organizations are granted liability protection for harm caused by their acts or omissions in sanctioned events, except in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. State laws may impose conditions such as risk management procedures and liability for employee actions. State laws may impose conditions on nonprofit athletic organizations for liability protection, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. A limitation of liability is not applicable if the civil action is brought by a State or local government officer under State or local law. The limitation on liability does not apply to certain claims arising from antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or laws protecting from discrimination. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations' acts or omissions filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
