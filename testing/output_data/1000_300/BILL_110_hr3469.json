A report detailing current equipment usage must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Act mandates increased use of Department of Defense equipment for border surveillance. A report to Congress must include current equipment usage, a plan to increase equipment use, and types of support to be provided. During a 1-year period, the Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the Canada-US border. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to support this initiative. SEC. 3. INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security will construct roads, acquire barriers, and facilities to control US borders. Quarterly progress reports will be submitted to Congress, and appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008-2012.\n\nSEC. 4. PORTS OF ENTRY. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to construct additional ports of entry along the international land borders of the United States and make necessary improvements to existing ports of entry. SEC. 5. SECURE COMMUNICATION.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security will develop a plan to enhance satellite communication for Border Patrol agents and other agencies for clear and secure communication. This includes communication between agents, stations, residents in remote areas, and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nSEC. 6. UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES. SEC. 6. UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is required to acquire and maintain at least 5 unmanned aerial vehicles and related equipment for patrolling the US international borders.
