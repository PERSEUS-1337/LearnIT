    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement as part of its Asia-Pacific strategy. The 12 countries concluded negotiations in late 2015 and signed the agreement in February 2016. Congress played an active role in oversight and would need to pass implementing legislation for the TPP to take effect in the U.S. The TPP agreement, negotiated by the Obama Administration, requires implementing legislation from Congress to take effect in the U.S. Proponents argue that the TPP's significance goes beyond economics to include strategic aspects, allowing the U.S. to exert influence in the region and beyond. The TPP agreement, negotiated by the Obama Administration, requires implementing legislation from Congress to take effect in the U.S. Proponents argue that the TPP's strategic importance lies in the United States using it as a tool to exert influence in the region and beyond, strengthening alliances, maintaining leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhancing national security, liberalizing trade, and establishing trade rules consistent with U.S. interests. China's economic rise and initiatives in the region are also key factors in analyzing U.S. influence. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are important factors in analyzing U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Some analysts suggest that China's initiatives aim to reduce U.S. presence and power in the region. The TPP is seen as a way for the U.S. to maintain leadership in Asia. China is attempting to create a regional order to minimize U.S. presence and power. The TPP is viewed as a means to maintain U.S. leadership in Asia and establish trade rules with an eye towards China. Some argue that framing the TPP as countering Chinese initiatives could be counterproductive and that U.S. and Chinese trade goals may be mutually reinforcing. Trade agreements involve economic and political elements, creating a challenge in balancing policy priorities. Trade agreements, such as the TPP, involve economic and political elements that can create tension in balancing policy priorities. Supporters and opponents of the agreement focus on different aspects, with proponents highlighting broader strategic implications that are challenging to quantify. This report will examine strategic arguments presented by the Administration and TPP proponents and opponents. The report examines strategic arguments presented by the Administration, TPP proponents, and opponents, focusing on the Asia-Pacific region and implications for Asia. It discusses the historical context of U.S. trade agreements and institutions like FTAs, highlighting the political solidarity aspect with Israel in the past. The United States has signed FTAs with countries like Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman for security and foreign policy objectives, not just economic reasons. The first FTA in Asia was with Singapore in 2004, seen as strategically important due to security interests. The Obama Administration emphasized the geostrategic importance of trade policy initiatives in Asia, such as the TPP, to sustain U.S. leadership in shaping the global economic order. U.S. trade policy initiatives in Asia, particularly the TPP, are crucial for geostrategic importance. The Administration's 2015 National Security Strategy emphasized the need to shape a global economic order that reflects U.S. interests and values. The TPP is viewed as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader, and its approval is seen as vital for the rebalancing strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP is a key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, crucial for U.S. leadership and credibility. Administration officials argue that the agreement signals active integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, with potential benefits for all parties involved. This view is supported by many in the region, including TPP negotiating partners. The United States will become more deeply embedded in the Asia-Pacific region through the TPP, which is seen as crucial for U.S. leadership and credibility. Proponents argue that the agreement has wider strategic significance and failing to conclude it would hurt U.S. credibility worldwide. Additionally, some believe that the TPP is essential for developing and strengthening regional institutions to promote cooperation and peaceful resolution of differences. The U.S. strategy aims to develop regional institutions to foster cooperation and peaceful resolution of differences through respect for rules and norms. Proponents argue that the TPP is crucial for advancing global prosperity and reinforcing U.S. alliances in East Asia. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of passing TPP for U.S. security interests. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of passing TPP for U.S. security interests, comparing it to the significance of another aircraft carrier. Proponents believe the agreement will strengthen U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics argue that security partnerships are more influenced by countries' assessment of their security interests rather than trade agreements. For example, the impact of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement on security relationships remains unclear. The impact of trade agreements like the KORUS FTA and TPP on security alliances in East Asia is debated. While some argue that these agreements strengthen alliances, others believe that security partnerships are more influenced by countries' assessment of their security interests. Japan's strategic decisions drive its cooperation with the U.S., and the future of alliances may not heavily depend on the success or failure of trade agreements. In recent years, Japan's strategic decisions have driven deeper cooperation with the United States. The TPP could have a significant impact on countries like Vietnam, pushing for market-oriented reforms. Approval of the TPP by Vietnam would signal closer ties with the U.S., while failure to do so may affect their perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner. Approval of the TPP by Vietnam is seen as a signal of closer ties with the U.S. and a move towards market-oriented reforms. Failure to approve the agreement could impact Vietnam's perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner. Proponents believe the TPP will help promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values, including a rules-based trading system. The link between the TPP's trade rules and security realm is less clear, but large trade agreements like the TPP may influence countries' strategic interests. Implementing the TPP could strengthen U.S. security relationships in the Pacific by signaling key partnerships and priorities, while a failure to do so may be perceived as a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in the region. Many argue that U.S. credibility in Asia is in question, with China's rise and North Korea's threats challenging U.S. influence. A failed TPP could create an influence vacuum for China to fill, impacting key relationships like that with Japan. The rejection of a TPP agreement by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation, impacting relationships like that between the United States and Japan. Proponents argue that the TPP will promote economic growth and advance U.S. interests by influencing trade regimes at various levels. Proponents argue that the rules established in the TPP will promote economic growth and advance U.S. interests by influencing trade regimes at several levels, encouraging market opening and economic reforms among current members, creating incentives for other Asia-Pacific nations to follow suit, addressing new trade barriers through new rules, and updating critical gaps in existing trade rules. Central to U.S. negotiating objectives in the TPP is the goal to update the rules-based trading system. The United States aims to update the rules-based trading system through the TPP, building on its history of leading trade liberalization efforts since World War II. The current WTO Doha Round has stalled, prompting the need for new rules and norms to address trade barriers. The current WTO Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round) has stalled due to differences among members, leading countries like the United States to pursue new trade rules through agreements like the TPP. TPP proponents argue that its scale creates a significant bloc of nations with agreed disciplines. The TPP is a regional agreement involving 12 economies, accounting for 37% of global GDP. It allows for new countries to join and could encourage domestic reforms in emerging economies to gain access to the U.S. market. This could also promote internationally recognized worker rights and environmental protection measures. The TPP is a regional agreement involving 12 economies, accounting for 37% of global GDP. It allows for new countries to join and could encourage domestic reforms in emerging economies to gain access to the U.S. market. Incentives in the agreement could also promote U.S. goals such as respect for worker rights and environmental protection measures. Proponents argue that the TPP could draw interest from other countries, leading to further trade and investment liberalization in the region. However, some note that the TPP does not include some of Asia's largest economies like China, India, and Indonesia. The TPP, involving 12 economies and accounting for 37% of global GDP, may not create a comprehensive set of trade rules in the Asia-Pacific as it excludes major economies like China, India, and Indonesia. However, there is potential for growth as countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand have shown interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members. Taiwan has also expressed interest, but many Asian nations face domestic opposition to joining the agreement.

However, there is potential for growth as countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand have shown interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members. Taiwan has also expressed interest, but many Asian nations face domestic opposition to joining the agreement. The Administration argues that the TPP's influence may expand, with Taiwan expressing interest in membership. Some Asian nations and current TPP parties are facing domestic opposition to joining, while analysts suggest that U.S. FTA partners like South Korea and Colombia may seek entry in the near future. Proponents believe that mega-regionals like the TPP and T-TIP could influence multilateral negotiations and establish new trade rules beyond existing WTO commitments. The TPP and T-TIP may impact multilateral trade negotiations by establishing new rules beyond WTO commitments. Critics fear that focusing on bilateral and regional agreements could hinder multilateral initiatives, potentially undermining the WTO's role in trade liberalization. Mega-regionals could complicate the trading system with overlapping rules instead of operating through established multilateral standards.

Mega-regionals could complicate the trading system with overlapping rules instead of operating through established multilateral standards. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a significant negotiation in the Asia-Pacific region, involving ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective FTA. The United States has not expressed interest in joining the RCEP. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a collective Free Trade Agreement (FTA) involving ASEAN members and six other nations. The United States has not shown interest in joining RCEP negotiations. RCEP's final provisions are still undetermined, but a comparison with ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP suggests potential differences in terms of trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, labor, environmental provisions, and disciplines on state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The TPP includes more extensive provisions on intellectual property rights, investment, labor, and environmental issues compared to ASEAN FTAs. RCEP, on the other hand, may present an alternative or challenge to U.S. trade efforts through the TPP. Some believe both agreements can complement each other for regional economic growth. The impact of RCEP and TPP on the existing trade architecture in the region remains uncertain. The TPP and RCEP are two regional agreements that may impact the existing trade architecture in the region. The TPP is at a more advanced stage than RCEP, but a delay in TPP's ratification could alter the sequencing. Both agreements involve countries that are also members of APEC, which has discussed the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific since 2006. APEC members have discussed creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) since 2006, with China and the US supporting this goal. In 2014, APEC leaders recognized TPP and RCEP as potential pathways to FTAAP. China's inclusion in or exclusion from TPP could have significant implications for the US and the region, given its economic importance. President Obama and TPP proponents argue that completing the agreement is strategically important in light of China's growing influence. The proposed TPP is seen as a way for the United States to counter China's regional influence and shape economic development in line with U.S. interests. The agreement is considered strategically important due to China's growing international influence and its efforts to create a regional order that may not align with U.S. interests. The proposed TPP aims to shape economic development in line with U.S. interests by creating enforceable standards and norms that other regional nations may adopt. This could influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions in ways favorable to U.S. interests, as stated by President Obama in 2015. A completed TPP could also push China to further liberalize its economic and trade regime. The completion of the TPP could prompt China to liberalize its economic and trade policies, potentially leading to further reforms and alignment with international norms. However, some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may overstate its influence on trade and investment rules in the region. Concerns also exist that using the TPP to constrain Chinese interests could lead to responses detrimental to U.S. interests. China's leaders could react negatively if they perceive the TPP as a tool to limit their interests, potentially harming U.S. interests. They argue that opposing China's economic initiatives in Asia could make the U.S. appear obstructive and raise doubts about its commitment to regional development. Additionally, Asian nations are unlikely to adopt trade policies that do not benefit them, regardless of their origin. China's leaders are focused on strengthening their economy and increasing their global role through initiatives like the One Belt, One Road project to enhance trade and economic development. China aims to create new trade linkages through the Belt and the Maritime Silk Road, known as the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative. New financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund provide capital for economic development projects. China also seeks to increase the use of its currency, the renminbi, to support international trade and investment. The establishment of RCEP is seen as a step towards a broader FTAAP for regional economic integration. China's leaders aim to enhance China's global economic stature through programs like RCEP and FTAAP. They are actively promoting reforms in multilateral institutions like the UN, IMF, and World Bank, with the establishment of AIIB offering an alternative model for development banks. The AIIB aims to provide an alternative model for development banks like the ADB, but it is uncertain if it will be distinct from or aligned with existing institutions. China is also reshaping diplomatic and security spheres to reduce U.S. influence, such as refashioning CICA and reclaiming disputed reefs in the South China Sea. China is reshaping diplomatic and security spheres to reduce U.S. influence by forming a new Asian continental security system and reclaiming disputed reefs in the South China Sea. China's views on the TPP have varied, with some seeing it as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. President Obama has stated that the TPP is not meant to contain or disadvantage China. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process softened after Japan joined the talks in 2013. China's Vice Finance Minister stated that a TPP agreement was incomplete without China, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP in 2014. China's Vice Finance Minister stated that a TPP agreement was \"incomplete without China.\" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP in 2014, stating that various FTA arrangements can foster a just and free international trade order. U.S. officials welcome China to join the TPP, but Chinese officials find some standards difficult to implement. President Obama mentioned in June 2015 that China had shown interest in participating in the TPP. Analysts believe the U.S. aims to integrate China more deeply into trade liberalization and establish new trade rules beyond the WTO. Analysts believe the US aims to integrate China more deeply into trade liberalization and establish new trade rules beyond the WTO. The US is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially involve China in the TPP. Congress has played a direct role in guiding TPP negotiations by renewing Trade Promotion Authority in 2015. Since joining the TPP in 2008, Congress has guided negotiations and renewed Trade Promotion Authority in 2015. Congress will play a direct role in considering TPP and its strategic elements, examining issues such as whether it furthers a broader foreign policy strategy. TPP proponents argue that the agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules in the Asia-Pacific region. They believe it could further U.S. diplomatic and security goals beyond trade, reinforcing U.S. leadership in the region and encouraging nations to adopt a more U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook. Congress should consider these arguments and whether the TPP aligns with a well-considered foreign policy strategy. The TPP proponents argue that the agreement aligns with a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules in the Asia-Pacific region and reinforce U.S. leadership. Congress needs to weigh the strategic implications of the TPP and consider if it distracts from its direct impact on the U.S. economy. The TPP's strategic impact depends on membership expansion and striking a balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. It is seen as a key measure of U.S. leadership in Asia and an opportunity for pursuing regional trade goals. The TPP's strategic impact depends on balancing trade liberalization with U.S. economic interests. Congress should consider the implications of failing to ratify the agreement on U.S. leadership in the region and the potential setback in pursuing regional trade goals. The TPP's strategic impact depends on balancing trade liberalization with U.S. economic interests. Congress should consider the implications of failing to ratify the agreement on U.S. leadership in the region and the potential setback in pursuing regional trade goals. Meanwhile, other countries in the region continue to pursue their own trade arrangements. The TPP's 12 participating countries do not include several strategically and economically important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Observers urge the U.S. to enunciate strategies that reinforce economic engagement beyond the current TPP membership to prevent neglect or ignorance perceptions. Congress may need to assess if existing U.S. economic initiatives in Asia are sufficient for broad goals of furthering U.S. influence or if additional economic initiatives are advisable. The TPP's strategic impact depends on balancing trade liberalization with U.S. economic interests. Congress may need to assess if existing U.S. economic initiatives in Asia are sufficient for furthering U.S. influence or if additional initiatives are advisable. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations may impact the multilateral trading system. The TPP's potential impact on the multilateral trading system, specifically the WTO, is a concern for some. Congress needs to consider if the TPP will support global trade liberalization or lead to fragmentation. There are mixed views on whether the TPP will enhance or undermine the WTO's role in global trade discussions."
