Participation is voluntary, with about 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with premiums shared between the federal. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with premiums shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. Benefits and cost sharing vary among FEHB plans, covering basic services like hospital and physician care with deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. Prior to FEHB's creation in 1959, federal employees had to obtain health insurance independently or through union plans. In 1959, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) was passed, establishing parameters for eligibility, types of health plans, and government's share of premiums for federal employees. It also created an Employees Health Benefits Fund to cover program expenses. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) established eligibility, types of health plans, and government's share of premiums for federal employees. It created an Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. The general model of FEHB remains the same, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers and sharing premium costs with the government. Many aspects of FEHB have been modified over time. Since its establishment, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) has undergone various modifications. While employees and retirees continue to share premium costs with the government, changes have been made to the formula for the government's share of premiums, leading to increased costs. Eligibility, services, and benefits have also been expanded. Policymakers and researchers view FEHB as a model for health insurance programs and a means to extend coverage to certain individuals. The FEHB model, with competing insurers offering various coverage options to enrollees, is seen as successful in promoting cost-conscious choices and controlling overall costs. Researchers suggest exporting aspects of this model to other health programs like Medicare or creating new programs based on FEHB to cover uninsured individuals or small business employees. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to expand FEHB eligibility or establish new programs. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to expand FEHB eligibility or establish new programs modeled after FEHB to provide coverage to individuals who are not federal workers or retirees, such as small business employees or the uninsured. Lessons learned from FEHB may have been instructive for state and federal officials establishing health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential applicability as a model for other health care programs, as Congress has a financial interest in the program's viability and sustainability. Congressional policymakers have a financial interest in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, as the federal government has always paid a portion of its costs. Congress has the authority to restructure FEHB to maintain or improve its function. The report provides information on how FEHB has evolved and how Congress has interacted with the program in the past, including changes to funding, premium shares, eligibility, and policy implementation. Congress has conditioned the use of federal funds on policy changes in the FEHB program, altered the formula for government's share of premiums, modified program eligibility, and implemented policies affecting Medicare and FEHB relationship. Congress can impose conditions on federal funds, such as prohibiting the use for abortions except in life-threatening situations. The provision prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions was renewed annually with few changes, except in 1994 and 1995 when it was excluded. The reinstated provision allowed funds for abortions in cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. The government's share of premiums in the FEHB program has increased over the years, with the initial 50% share set in the legislation. In 1971, the \"big six\" formula was introduced, which calculated the average premiums of six health plans offered. The government's share of premiums in the FEHB program increased over the years, starting at 50% and rising to 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans. The formula for setting the government's share was introduced in 1997 and remains in effect today, not exceeding 75% of the premium for any one plan. Eligible participants include current federal employees and retirees. The government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans in the FEHB program, not exceeding 75% for any one plan. Eligibility has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members since the program's enactment. In 1978, FEHB was extended to part-time employees and in 1988 to certain temporary workers. Congress also authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) in 1988, allowing separated employees to continue FEHB coverage for up to 18 months. TCC enrollees must pay the full premium and a 2% administrative fee. Children aging out of their parents' plans can have 36 months of coverage. Initially, there was little interaction between FEHB and Medicare, but in 1982 federal employees became eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program was established in 1959 for federal employees, with eligibility and enrollment procedures outlined. In 1982, federal workers became eligible for Medicare due to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal employees, outlining eligibility, benefits, premiums, and OPM's role. Eligible participants included current employees, retirees with at least 12 years of service, and family members. OPM could approve health benefit plans. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 established the FEHB program for federal employees, outlining eligibility criteria. OPM was authorized to contract or approve different types of health benefit plans for participation in FEHB, including Service Benefit Plan, Indemnity Benefit Plan, and Employee Organization Plans. As of July 1, 1959, employee organization plans sponsored by the organization provide health benefits to employees, retirees, and their families. These plans include group-practice prepayment plans and individual-practice prepayment plans. Under P.L. 86-382, the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was 50% for the service benefit plan and the indemnity plan. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was determined by the type of plan and enrollee. For service benefit and indemnity plans, the government's share was 50% of the carrier's lowest rate. Biweekly government shares ranged from $1.25 to $4.25 depending on coverage type. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was determined by the type of plan and enrollee, ranging from $1.75 to $2.50. The Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 was amended by P.L. 88-59 to extend the deadline for applications from qualified employee organizations to participate in FEHB until December 31, 1963. The act also removed the requirement for organizations to have offered health care benefits to members before applying. P.L. 88-284 broadened FEHB coverage in 1964 to include more groups and allowed retirees to continue their coverage. OPM was given authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. Premium shares were standardized for all enrollees. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 88-531) gave OPM authority to terminate FEHB plan contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. Premium shares were standardized for all enrollees, regardless of gender. The act also changed the government's share of premiums for certain plans. P.L. 88-531 authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners and their dependents if the Civil Service Retirement Act applies to the commissioners. P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for teachers in the District of Columbia. P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for teachers in the District of Columbia who had been temporarily employed for at least two school years.

P.L. 89-504 amended FEHB to change the government share of premiums, extending coverage for dependent children to age 22 and allowing employees on leave without pay to maintain coverage. P.L. 90-486 converted National Guard technicians to federal employee status for FEHB eligibility. P.L. 90-578 authorized FEHB coverage for certain congressional staff fellowships. The Technicians Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-486) converted National Guard technicians to federal employee status for FEHB coverage. The Federal Magistrates Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-578) authorized FEHB coverage for full-time United States magistrates. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-175) granted federal employees the option to continue FEHB participation during a transfer to an international organization. The Increase Contribution by the Federal Government to the Cost of Health Benefits Insurance Act (P.L. 91-418) adjusted the government's share of premiums to reflect medical price inflation. The Increase Contribution by the Federal Government to the Cost of Health Benefits Insurance Act (P.L. 91-418), enacted on September 25, 1970, changed the government's share of premiums by implementing the \"big six\" formula. This formula calculates the government's share at 40% of the average of six benefit plans, including the service benefit plan, indemnity plan, employee organization plans, and comprehensive medical plans with the highest enrollment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1970 set the government's share of premiums at 40% of the average of six benefit plans. It allowed family members of deceased employees with less than five years of service to continue enrollment. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments. P.L. 93-160 and P.L. 93-246 extended FEHB coverage to eligible U.S. nationals employed by the federal government outside the U.S. and increased the government's share of FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50%. P.L. 93-246 increased the government's share of the FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50% in 1974, with a provision to raise it to 60% in 1975. The government's share was capped at 75% of the total premium amount for any one health plan. Health insurance plans in FEHB had to comply with OPM decisions on health benefit entitlement. P.L. 93-363 and P.L. 94-310 provided direct access for FEHB enrollees to optometrists and clinical psychologists without referral and granted court leave to federal employees as witnesses in certain judicial proceedings. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 allowed the government's share of health plan premiums for retirees to be available until expended. P.L. 94-342 restored eligibility for health benefits coverage to surviving spouses whose annuities were terminated due to remarriage. The P.L. 95-368 established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws. It provided protections to medically underserved populations and required insurance carriers to pay for certain health services from 1980 to 1984. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage. It defined part-time career employment as consisting of a 16 to 32-hour work week. P.L. 95-437, enacted on October 10, 1978, allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage. Part-time career employment is defined as a 16 to 32-hour work week. P.L. 95-583, passed on November 2, 1978, reduced the required length of creditable service for FEHB coverage in retirement from 12 years to 5 years. The amendments in P.L. 96-54 and P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage, excluding certain individuals. P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage to exclude non-citizens or nationals stationed outside the US, unless they were employed in specific agencies in the Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 96-179 amended survivor benefits provisions for dependent children under FEHB. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 eliminated the \"lives with\" requirement for a natural child to be covered by FEHB and added a dependency requirement for all children to be covered under FEHB. P.L. 97-248 required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax starting January 1, 1983, allowing them to count their federal employment towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 allowed federal employees to qualify for premium-free Medicare Part A based on previous private sector employment subject to the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax. Medicare payments were made secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans, including FEHB. P.L. 97-346 required the government to pay the difference in health plan premiums for 1983 into contingency reserves of FEHB plans based on enrollees. P.L. 98-151 prohibited funds from being used for abortions or administrative expenses for FEHB plans covering abortions, except in cases endangering the woman's life. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, who must pay both the employee's and government's share of the premium. Abortion coverage in FEHB plans is prohibited except in cases where the woman's life is endangered. P.L. 99-53 authorized additional employee organization plans in FEHB if applied within 90 days of enactment. It allowed certain disability annuitants to enroll in an FEHB plan if previously enrolled. P.L. 99-251 introduced a new comprehensive medical plan called a mixed model prepayment plan. P.L. 99-251, enacted on February 27, 1986, introduced mixed model prepayment plans in FEHB, combining group practice and individual practice prepayment plans. It eliminated the requirement for group practice plans to include physicians from three specialties and extended contracting authority to health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors. P.L. 99-251 mandated studies by OPM to extend FEHB contracting authority to health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors. It also allowed clinical social workers to contract, with plans requiring referral by a psychiatrist for reimbursement. Congress emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction for FEHB enrollees. OPM was directed to assess the adequacy of FEHB information materials during open enrollment. The act granted OPM the authority to waive the five-year service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement under exceptional circumstances. Enrollees were given a three-week period to change or cancel enrollment in case of rate or benefit changes. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave OPM authority to waive the five-year service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement under exceptional circumstances. It also required OPM to determine minimum financial reserves for carriers and set provisions for refunds. USPS was mandated to pay starting October 1, 1986. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335) expanded FEHB eligibility to individuals first employed by the government of the District of Columbia before October 1, 1987. Additionally, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (P.L. 99-569) provided health benefits for certain former spouses of Central Intelligence.

The Making Technical Corrections Relating to the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (P.L. 100-238) declared nonfederal employees ineligible for FEHB benefits after October 1, 1988, but continued coverage for St. Elizabeth's Hospital employees who became District of Columbia employees. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) included provisions affecting FEHB, later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234). It would have required OPM to reduce rates for retirees in FEHB who were Medicare eligible and specified the reduction based on estimated costs of medical services. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) required OPM to reduce rates for Medicare-eligible retirees in FEHB based on estimated medical service costs. OPM was also mandated to report to Congress on incorporating health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals and adopting NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental health benefit plans under FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) set provisions for OPM to impose sanctions on health care providers convicted of illegal activities, establish time limits for debarment proceedings, and authorize fines for false charges. It also created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage for federal employees. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose fines on providers for false charges and created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage for separating employees and their families for up to 18 months. TCC enrollees must pay the full premium plus a 2% administrative charge. TCC is available to employees separated for reasons other than gross misconduct and individuals no longer meeting unmarried dependent child requirements. OPM was directed to offer health benefits coverage to temporary federal employees with one year of continuous service. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1988 (P.L. 100-679) made certain employees on the office staff of former Presidents or Vice Presidents eligible for FEHB. Additionally, the Relating to the Method by Which Government Contributions to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Shall Be Computed for 1990 or 1991 Act (P.L. 101-76) adjusted the government's share of FEHB plans in response to Aetna's withdrawal. The Indemnity Benefit Plan participated in the adjustment of the government's share of FEHB plans in response to Aetna's withdrawal under P.L. 101-76. The act calculated the government's share based on the Aetna high option premium and the average percentage change in the remaining five plans. If comprehensive reform legislation is enacted, these provisions would not apply. Additionally, P.L. 101-239 required the USPS to pay the government's share of FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired or died after October 1, 1986. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 101-246) authorized FEHB coverage for former spouses of Foreign Service employees under specific conditions. P.L. 101-303 and P.L. 101-508 allowed federal retirees to pay health benefits premiums directly if their annuity was insufficient. P.L. 101-508 also included FEHB-related reforms.

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1991 (P.L. 101-513) improved coordination between FEHB and Medicare, applied Medicare payment limits to services for retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 and older, and required USPS to pay the government's share of FEHB premiums for certain annuitants. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1991 (P.L. 101-513) provided FEHB benefits to U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members. It also appropriated funds for federal life insurance and pay benefits. P.L. 101-530 and P.L. 102-88 provided relief for National Guard technicians and former spouses of CIA employees regarding FEHB benefits. P.L. 102-90 addressed legislative branch appropriations in 1992. Employees who remarry before age 55 can regain FEHB eligibility if the remarriage ends by death, annulment, or divorce. P.L. 102-90 allows Senate Employee Child Care Center employees to enroll in FEHB within 31 days of enactment or during open enrollment. P.L. 102-393 prohibits using funds to make FEHB changes affecting Medicare beneficiaries. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) restricted changes to FEHB that would impact Medicare beneficiaries, preventing OPM from implementing certain cost-sharing adjustments and eliminating coinsurance waivers for prescription drugs for Medicare-covered FEHB enrollees in plan year 1993. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) allowed for the continuation of FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force. The act limited individual payments for coverage to the employee's share of premiums and required the last employing agency to cover the remaining portion. The Secretary of Defense was directed to review FEHB for potential similar health care programs. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older who do not participate in Medicare Part B. Physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments must also accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB. Nonparticipating providers in Medicare cannot charge more than the limiting charge. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended and modified the payment and cost-sharing requirements for physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments under the FEHB. It also temporarily extended the restructured formula for plan years 1990-1998. This act did not include a provision restricting funding for abortion coverage in FEHB plans, unlike previous appropriations acts. The FEGLI Living Benefits Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-409) allowed individuals covered under certain health benefit plans to enroll in an FEHB plan upon termination.

The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 (P.L. 104-208) allowed individuals voluntarily separating from surplus positions in the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy to maintain FEHB coverage by paying their share of premiums. It also required OPM to establish regulations for surviving children to enroll in FEHB plans if their survivor annuity was reinstated due to the end of a marriage. Additionally, the act mandated a report to be written by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with HHS and OPM, for a demonstration program allowing certain beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs entitled to Medicare Part A to enroll. The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-12) prohibited federal funds for assisted suicide-related benefits and services, and OPM from contracting with plans covering these services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) changed the FEHB premium formula, requiring OPM to calculate the weighted average premium of all plans annually by October 1st for individual and family coverage separately. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) modified the government's share of FEHB premiums by changing the formula and setting the biweekly government share at 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans. It also prohibited individuals enrolled in FEHB from enrolling in a Medicare Medical Savings Account plan until OPM certifies policies to prevent increased expenditures. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration project with OPM allowing certain individuals eligible for Department of Defense health benefits to enroll in FEHB health plans. The project ran for three contract years, with enrollment open in 2000 and ending in 2002. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) required a demonstration project under FEHB for three contract years, allowing eligible beneficiaries to enroll in 2000. The project ended on December 31, 2002, with reports to Congress on costs, effectiveness, and feasibility. The act also mandated OPM to debar fraudulent health care providers from FEHB and modified the definition of a carrier under FEHB. P.L. 105-266, enacted on October 19, 1998, made administrative changes to FEHB. It required OPM to debar fraudulent health care providers and revised the definition of a carrier under FEHB. The act allowed government-wide plans in FEHB to be underwritten by affiliates licensed in each state and preempted state or local laws related to health insurance. OPM was also tasked with encouraging carriers to obtain discounts from health care providers. FEHB supersedes state and local laws related to health insurance. OPM encourages carriers to obtain discounts from healthcare providers. The act established rules for readmission of discontinued plans in FEHB and clarified direct access to licensed providers. P.L. 105-266 clarified that FEHB plans can provide direct access, direct payment, and reimbursement to licensed health care providers not specified in statute. It also allowed individuals from FDIC and Federal Reserve health plans to enroll in FEHB plans when their plans terminate. Additionally, any prior enrollment in FDIC or Federal Reserve health plans before termination is considered enrollment in FEHB. The District of Columbia Courts and Justice Technical Corrections Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-274) treated Public Defender Service employees as federal employees for health insurance eligibility under FEHB, work injury compensation, retirement, and life insurance.

This provision has been renewed annually in subsequent appropriations bills. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (P.L. 106-65) required the Secretary of Defense to compare health care coverage under TRICARE and FEHB, including cost-sharing requirements, overall costs, covered benefits, and exclusions. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) also addressed health care coverage for military personnel. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) changed how TCC works for certain individuals, allowing them to continue coverage under FEHB and be liable for no more than the employee's share of premiums.

It covered involuntary separation, declination of reassignment, or voluntary separation. Employees receiving TCC are not liable for more than their share of the health benefits premium, with NASA covering the remaining share. This requirement applies to separations between the enactment of the section and December 31, 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains provisions that apply to health insurance coverage, including FEHB plans. OPM has provided guidance on implementing ACA provisions, some of which require FEHB plans to comply with new requirements. For example, adult children up to age 26 can remain on FEHB plans. OPM has expanded ACA provisions for FEHB plans, requiring implementation before specified dates. Adult children up to age 26 can stay on parent's plan, effective January 2011. TCC is available for three years post-26. Disabled children can remain dependents indefinitely if disabled before 26. New plans must offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. The ACA required new plans to offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. Plans may waive cost sharing for preventive care only with in-network providers. Plans must provide a summary of benefits and coverage to applicants and enrollees. The ACA required new plans to offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs and provide a summary of benefits and coverage to applicants and enrollees. Plan sponsors must offer a summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and a uniform glossary of terms to help consumers understand health insurance terms. OPM mandated all FEHB plans to provide an SBC and glossary for plan year 2013. The ACA prohibited lifetime limits on certain health benefits and required restricted annual limits before January 1, 2014. Some FEHB plans had imposed limits on certain benefits, but OPM expected all plans to comply starting in 2013. The ACA required FEHB plans to eliminate limits on specified benefits and comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials starting in 2013. It also prohibited preexisting condition exclusions, which had little impact on FEHB plans. Additionally, FEHB plans were required to report a medical loss ratio as part of the ACA regulations. The ACA required FEHB plans to report a medical loss ratio, which involves the ratio of plan-incurred claims to total premium revenue. Large group plans, including FEHB plans, must issue rebates to enrollees if the ratio falls below 85%. Rebates are deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve and can be used to reduce the following year's premiums. Starting in 2011, the ACA modified the definition of qualified medical expenses for tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs. OTC medicines are not covered unless prescribed, except for insulin. The penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals was raised from 10% to 20% for those under 65. In 2013, maximum annual contributions were lowered. The ACA raised the penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals from 10% to 20% for those under 65. Maximum annual contributions to a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) were lowered from $5,000 to $2,500 starting in 2013. Eligible Indian tribes can purchase FEHB for their tribal employees since May 1, 2012, with the tribe paying the government's share of the premium. Administrative requirements were imposed on employers affecting federal agencies. The ACA imposed administrative requirements on employers regarding federal agencies, including providing the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on W-2 forms. Starting in 2014, insurers, self-insuring employers, and government agencies had to report individual coverage details to the Secretary of HHS. The requirement was delayed until 2015. Members of Congress and certain individuals are limited to specific health plans under the federal government. The ACA imposed administrative requirements on employers regarding federal agencies, including providing the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on W-2 forms. Starting in 2014, insurers, self-insuring employers, and government agencies had to report individual coverage details to the Secretary of HHS. The act specifies that only health plans created under the ACA or offered through an exchange are available to Members of Congress and certain congressional staff. Members and designated congressional staff were no longer able to purchase FEHB plans as active employees starting January 1, 2014, but can enroll in a health plan offered through a SHOP exchange with an employer contribution. Members and designated congressional staff eligible for retirement can enroll in an FEHB plan upon retirement. The ACA includes provisions impacting FEHB plans, such as annual fees on health insurance plans, a PCORI fee on insurers, and a 40% excise tax on coverage exceeding certain thresholds starting in 2018. Members and designated congressional staff eligible for retirement can enroll in an FEHB plan upon retirement. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43194, Health Benefits for Members of Congress and Designated Congressional Staff. The ACA imposed a 40% excise tax on health insurers and plan administrators for coverage exceeding certain thresholds, starting in 2018. The tax applies to employer and employee premium payments, dental and vision coverage premiums, and payments to health-related accounts. Thresholds are $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, indexed to inflation. Amounts exceeding these thresholds are subject to the tax. The ACA imposed a 40% excise tax on health insurance coverage exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, indexed to inflation. The Director of OPM is required to offer at least two multistate plans through each exchange, separate from FEHB, with no reduction in resources. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) allowed FEHB enrollees to choose \"self plus one\" coverage. The government's share of premiums for this coverage is determined based on the weighted average premium of all FEHB plans, with OPM paying either 72% of the average or 75% of a specific plan's premium, whichever is lower. FEHB plans are not required to offer a Multistate Plan (MSP), and MSP enrollees are treated as a separate risk pool from FEHB. The Director of OPM can establish separate units to ensure MSP administration does not interfere with FEHB administration. OPM determines premiums for self plus one coverage based on the weighted average premium of all FEHB plans, paying either 72% of the average or 75% of a specific plan's premium, whichever is lower. For the first year of self plus one coverage, OPM will calculate the weighted average premium through actuarial analysis."
