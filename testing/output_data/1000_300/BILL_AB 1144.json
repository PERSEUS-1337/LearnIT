    "title": "AB 1144",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products may be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles. A balanced portfolio of renewable energy resources will be procured to achieve the goals of cost-effectiveness and suitability. Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products must meet specific criteria related to interconnection with a California balancing authority or dynamic electricity transfer agreements. Unbundled renewable energy credits can be earned by electricity generated by an entity excluded from being an electrical corporation, meeting specific criteria, and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The generating facility must meet certain criteria, and the electricity generated must be used at a public entity-owned wastewater treatment facility. The renewable energy credit requirements include: the generating facility meeting specific criteria, the electricity being used at a public entity-owned wastewater treatment facility, the facility's generating capability being put into service after January 1, 2016, and the facility not participating in a specific bioenergy feed-in tariff program. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited towards each compliance period, including firmed and shaped eligible renewable energy resource electricity products scheduled into a California balancing authority. Additionally, any electricity generated that does not qualify under certain criteria must also be accounted for. In order to achieve a balanced portfolio, retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited towards each compliance period. This includes ensuring that a certain percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meet product content requirements, with varying percentages based on the compliance period. Any renewable energy contracts executed after June 1, 2010, must meet product content requirements. Restrictions on crediting renewable energy products apply to contracts after January 13, 2011. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if eligible under rules at the time of execution. The renewable energy contract must meet product content requirements if executed after June 1, 2010. Approval by the commission is required for electrical corporations. Contract amendments after June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change the renewable energy resource. The contract duration can be extended if the original commitment was 15 years or more. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements from the commission if unable to comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can lower the requirement but not below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot advertise the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. For calculating renewables portfolio standard obligations, electricity generated and sold by a public entity with renewable energy credits eligible for treatment must be added to the total retail sales of the buyer."
