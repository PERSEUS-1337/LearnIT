Duplicates in bronze may be sold to cover costs. The medals struck under this Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. An amount not to exceed $30,000 is authorized to pay for the cost of the medal, with proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.
