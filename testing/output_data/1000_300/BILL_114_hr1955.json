    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading. The Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights nutrient removal technology as an effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in wastewater discharge. The Administrator must consult with the Program Office when making grants under this program. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program aims to reduce total nutrients in wastewater discharge. The Administrator must consult with the Program Office and prioritize facilities based on nutrient load reductions, environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and meeting nutrient objectives outlined in Annex. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program aims to reduce total nutrients in wastewater discharge by prioritizing facilities based on nutrient load reductions, environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and meeting nutrient objectives outlined in Annex 4 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants not exceeding 55 percent of the project cost. The Administrator may grant up to 55 percent of the cost for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities. The term 'Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012' refers to the agreement signed in Washington on September 7, 2012. An eligible facility is defined as a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012, signed in Washington on September 7, 2012, further amends the agreement. An eligible facility is a municipal wastewater treatment plant with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day within the Great Lakes System. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this subsection. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this subsection, with $100,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020.
