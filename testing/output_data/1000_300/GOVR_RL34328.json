The America COMPETES Act establishes STEM education initiatives, a Director of Science, Engineering, and Education position, and White House efforts to promote innovation and competitiveness. To maintain economic growth and competitiveness, the US must engage in trade, offer high-quality products, and advance in science and technology for new goods, services, and job creation. Scientific and technological advances contribute to economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and increasing productivity. Various factors like government activity, firm management, and serendipity influence technological progress. The US has used a combination of direct and indirect policy approaches to enhance competitiveness since World War II. Since World War II, the United States has utilized direct and indirect measures to improve competitiveness. Concerns about competition from other economies arose post-WWII, with a peak in the 1970s when experts worried about losing market share in various industries to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries. The United States faced competition from industrialized countries in various industries, leading to a decline in market share. Concerns were raised about technological superiority, productivity growth, and educational proficiency compared to countries like Japan and West Germany. This was reflected in lower exports of high-tech products and a decrease in patents granted to Americans. The United States faced competition from industrialized countries like Japan and West Germany, leading to a decline in market share. Concerns were raised about technological superiority, productivity growth, and educational proficiency. Congress responded by passing various acts to address the issue, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and the Bayh-Dole Act. The United States responded to competitiveness concerns by passing various acts, including the Technology Transfer Act, National Cooperative Research Act, and Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The SEMATECH consortium was created to advance the semiconductor industry. Congressional actions aimed to increase corporate spending on research and development, such as the Economic Recovery Tax Act and Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Small Business Development Act set aside federal R&D funds for innovative small firms. Competitiveness concerns improved by the mid-1990s with economic and technological innovation advancements. The Business Development Act established federal R&D funds for innovative small firms. Competitiveness concerns improved in the mid-1990s with advancements in the economy and technology. Today's concerns focus on globalization and federal funding for science and engineering research. Concerns about globalization in the economy include issues such as federal funding for science and engineering research, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees. American companies rely heavily on international markets for sales and employ foreign workers. Globalization can have both positive and negative impacts on the economic futures of American companies, workers, and families, leading to increased productivity and living standards. The impact of globalization on the economic futures of American companies, workers, and families can be both positive and negative. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards, but it also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages, especially with competition from low-wage developing countries. Technology, increased global labor supply, and government policies are key factors driving today's globalization trends. The America COMPETES Act addresses some of these challenges. The America COMPETES Act addresses the impact of globalization by authorizing direct measures to tackle key trends such as increased global labor supply, government policies reducing trade barriers, and technology advancements. It also increases federal funding for basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer fields to drive technological progress and create new industries and jobs. The America COMPETES Act aims to boost technological progress by increasing federal funding for research in key fields like physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. It also focuses on making the U.S. labor force more competitive globally by addressing issues like the lack of proficiency in science and mathematics among American students. The America COMPETES Act aims to address the lack of proficiency in science and mathematics among American students by increasing the quality and quantity of STEM teachers and encouraging more students to pursue advanced STEM classes and degrees. It also authorizes actions to identify possible government trade and investment policies to support U.S. businesses engaged in innovation. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve STEM education and support U.S. businesses in innovation. Legislative initiatives encourage industry to invest in research, promote collaboration between companies and universities, and facilitate technology transfer. Experts have differing opinions on the best actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness. Some experts believe actions should be taken to enhance U.S. competitiveness, but doubt the effectiveness of the America COMPETES Act. Competitiveness can vary based on perspectives such as individual domestic firms, multinational corporations, or domestic labor. For domestic firms, competitiveness is focused on trade and market share against imports or foreign firms. Key measure is the economy's trade balance, as shown in U.S. trade in advanced technology products. The United States trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in the early 2000s, with the deficit growing steadily until 2008. This deficit does not necessarily indicate a lack of competitiveness in the export markets. The United States trade deficit in high technology products grew steadily from $16.6 billion to $55.5 billion by 2008. This deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the high technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies. However, closer policy scrutiny may be needed. Competitiveness for U.S. multinational corporations is defined by the ability of their overseas operations to compete for market share with foreign firms. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined after 2000 but rebounded by 2006. Competitiveness is defined by the ability of firms to invest resources in the U.S. or other countries. Domestic labor shares concerns about competing against foreign firms in export markets. The United States competes with foreign firms in export markets and for domestic labor. Key measures for domestic labor are employment levels and wages. U.S. firms invested $249 billion abroad in 2006, with concerns about displaced workers and lower wages. Most investment is in high-income developed countries, with a decreasing share going to developing countries. Most economists believe that U.S. direct investment abroad is due to a restructuring of manufacturing industries, not leading to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. NSF struggles to accurately determine the science and engineering workforce and the jobs created from it. They classify science and engineering occupations into five broad categories, but this does not cover all individuals with science and engineering degrees who apply their knowledge in their jobs. The NSF struggles to accurately determine the science and engineering workforce. They classify occupations into broad categories, but this does not cover all individuals with science and engineering degrees who apply their knowledge in their jobs. Some professionals use their science and engineering training in non-S&E occupations. The science and engineering workforce is diverse, with individuals applying their training in various occupations such as writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants. The size of this workforce is estimated to be between 5.0 million and 21.4 million individuals, with the most relevant number being 17.0 million in 2006, according to the National Science Board. The science and engineering workforce varied in size from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. The National Science Board suggests that the most relevant numbers are 17.0 million individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field, or 21.4 million including related fields like health or technology. These numbers reflect the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States. The science and engineering workforce varied in size from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. According to NSF data, 12.9 million workers reported needing at least a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge in 2003. Statistical analysts struggle to account for the need for all workers to have a basic understanding of STEM and the impact of new technologies on employment skills. Computerization has shifted employment tasks towards high-level tasks, reducing the need for routine manual and cognitive tasks. This shift has led to an increased demand for college-educated labor. The analysis found that task shifts in education demand can explain sixty percent of the relative demand shift favoring college labor from 1970 to 1998. The U.S. Census Bureau's long-term analysis shows significant growth in science and engineering occupations, outpacing the total labor force. Recent data from BLS shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. Recent data from BLS shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. Science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with faster growth expected in computer-related occupations, life sciences, social sciences, and post-secondary teaching positions. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. The demand for STEM occupations is projected to grow, with faster growth expected in computer-related occupations, life sciences, social sciences, and post-secondary teaching positions. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. Compensation for STEM workers is higher than the U.S. labor force, ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per annum. Recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients saw a 15% increase in mean real salary from 1993 to 2003. The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased by 15% from 1993 to 2003, with median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree reaching $65,000. There is significant variance among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields, with factors like foreign affiliate sales and global supply chain fragmentation impacting competitiveness. Factors such as foreign affiliate sales, global supply chain fragmentation, and the lack of inclusion of services and intangibles like knowledge and intellectual property are not fully considered in assessing a nation's competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness suggests that traditional measures like trade balance are less useful in today's global economy, where value is created through intangible assets in multinational firms. For individuals, additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be considered to understand prosperity. The Council on Competitiveness suggests additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power to understand an individual's prosperity. The America COMPETES Act assumes STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans and highlights the lack of proficiency in K-12 students due to a shortage of STEM-trained teachers. Scientists, engineers, and teachers with STEM degrees are believed to generate more enthusiasm for STEM in students. The lack of STEM teachers with education or training hinders proficiency in STEM. More Americans need to pursue STEM fields to ensure a competitive workforce and economic growth. STEM degrees lead to diverse job opportunities beyond traditional roles. Science and engineering research are crucial for U.S. competitiveness and innovation. Additional federal funding for basic science and engineering research is crucial for U.S. competitiveness and economic growth. The current funding is insufficient compared to other countries, impacting the nation's ability to create new industries and enhance existing ones. This is supported by analyses such as the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment, which compares the STEM education performance of U.S. students to their peers in other countries. In K-12 STEM education, the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment compared U.S. students' science and math scores to international peers in 2006. American students scored below the OECD average in both subjects. A study also found that U.S. middle school math teachers are not as well-prepared as teachers in other countries, contributing to lower scores for American students. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees. Inadequate teacher preparation and deficiencies in math curriculum contribute to lower scores for American middle-schoolers. The United States has one of the lowest rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees globally. STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees in the U.S. in 2002, compared to an international average of 26.4%. Research shows that investment in research and development has a significant impact on U.S. economic growth, accounting for 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Investment in research and development has a significant impact on U.S. economic growth, accounting for 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Some question the exclusive benefits of U.S. investments in federal research programs and the influence of the federal government in STEM education. Some question the federal government's influence in STEM education and whether investments in research and STEM education will benefit all Americans. Doubts are raised about the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields, with concerns about the demand for scientists and engineers and their salaries. Some analysts question the need for additional scientists and engineers in the United States, citing doubts about current workforce projections and the high demand for STEM occupations. Concerns also arise about the quality and quantity of scientists and engineers in China and India. Issues include potential oversupply, management of increased research funding, and challenges faced by agencies receiving funds. Policymakers consider both direct (increased funding) and indirect measures (tax policy) to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges faced by agencies receiving funds and proposes both direct and indirect measures to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness in technology development. Supporters of direct government assistance argue for focusing on promising technologies, while proponents of indirect measures believe the market is better at deciding worthy investments. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address, responding to concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically in the future due to insufficient investment in science and technology research. The America COMPETES Act and ACI aimed to address this issue, with some overlapping provisions. The America COMPETES Act and the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) aimed to address concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically in the future due to insufficient investment in science and technology research. Provisions included increased research funding at various agencies and the authorization of new research organizations. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for research agencies like NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science over FY2008-2010, with potential doubling of funding over seven years. It also emphasizes appropriate funding for NASA to enhance U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Many organizations advocate for increased research funding in physical sciences and engineering. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for research agencies like NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science over FY2008-2010, potentially doubling funding over seven years. Advocates call for increased research funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science based on the National Academies' Rising Above the Gathering Storm report. This report recommends a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research for the next seven years, citing a need for more support in these fields due to flat funding over the past 15 years. Agencies may be less inclined to support high-potential high-risk research without increased funding. The National Academies recommend a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. This is necessary due to stagnant funding over the past 15 years, which has led to a lack of support for high-potential high-risk research. Corporations are unlikely to fill this funding gap as they prioritize research that offers greater benefits to society. The NSF Authorization Act of 2002 supports this recommendation. The National Academies recommend a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. The committee believes this growth rate strikes an appropriate balance between urgency and efficiency in applying new funds. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual rate for doubling research activities over 10 years, citing limited funding availability. The National Academies recommend a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. The Administration has indicated that funding is limited, with a 7% annual rate proposed for doubling research activities over 10 years. The importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness is widely recognized, with a call for increased funding in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The National Academies recommend a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. The Administration's response was the American Competitiveness Initiative, proposing doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through basic scientific and engineering research and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through basic scientific and engineering research and STEM education, with a focus on funding balance and interagency collaboration. The Senate and House appropriations committees are concerned about the lack of balance in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA, with insufficient funds allocated for the Vision for Space Exploration and other important initiatives. A National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources, calling for a reevaluation of the agency's tasks and resources. The America COMPETES Act highlights the need for NASA to prioritize basic research funding. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of NASA prioritizing basic research funding, including allocating a percentage for high-risk, high reward projects. This provision aims to address concerns about the current federal research funding review mechanisms not being open to new, unproven ideas. Transformative research, which involves multidisciplinary work and high novelty, may not fit well within traditional project-focused research structures. The National Science Board (NSB) found that transformative research, which involves high novelty and multidisciplinary work, may not fit well within traditional project-focused research structures. Investigators are hesitant to submit radical ideas to NSF due to low success rates, leading to the development of initiatives like the Pioneer's Award by the National Institutes of Health. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the importance of transformative research at NSF. The Pioneer's Award was developed by NSF to support high-risk research. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 highlights the need for transformative research at NSF, which is considered revolutionary and cutting edge. The Act directs NSF to review current practices for supporting transformative proposals and provide regular reports to the Appropriations Committees. The Foundation will review and support transformational proposals, providing reports to Committees on addressing this emerging area. The House Committee on Appropriations allocated $10 million for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E to enhance economic and energy security through technology development. The goal of ARPA-E is to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States by developing technologies that reduce energy imports, greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy efficiency. It aims to achieve this through revolutionary energy technology projects based on the DARPA research management model. The concept for ARPA-E is based on the DARPA research management model used by the Department of Defense. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including an advanced civilian technology agency in the 100th and 101st Congresses. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report recommended the government consider a civilian technology corporation or agency for limited areas, including energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies and fuels. ARPA-E should bring excitement to energy research and attract the best minds, including students and young researchers. The report proposes creating an ARPA-like organization for energy research to focus on innovative, transformational projects that industry may not support. It aims to bridge gaps between basic research, development, and industrial innovation, serving as a model for improving technology transfer in other crucial areas. The report suggests creating a new tool, similar to ARPA, to bridge gaps between basic energy research, development, and industrial innovation. It proposes starting funding for ARPA-E at $300 million in the first year, increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. The effectiveness of the program would be evaluated at that point. The National Academies committee emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science with ARPA-E funding. They recommended that the organization and mission of ARPA-E be determined through consultation with experts. The National Academies committee recommended that the organization and mission of ARPA-E should be determined through consultation with experts, rather than specified in great detail. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to support research on emerging technologies. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories to support research on emerging technologies. The Institutes aim to train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, conduct research with partners, and create innovative technologies with industry partners. This initiative will reshape the nation's engineering research, education, and practices to address global challenges. The America COMPETES Act aims to train engineers in nanoscience and microsystems through partnerships with universities. Proponents argue that this training is essential to address challenges in global markets, national security, energy sustainability, and public health. The Act also authorizes new STEM education programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, encouraging students to pursue STEM education. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, support students in STEM education through various initiatives, and emphasize outreach and mentoring for women and minorities. Programs include grants for specialty high schools, internships for students at national labs, and centers of excellence in STEM education. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to establish specialty high schools, provide internships for students at national labs, create centers of excellence in STEM education, offer summer institutes for teachers, appoint a Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy, and implement a graduate research fellowship program called Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE). The curr_chunk discusses various new competitive grant programs at the Department of Education (ED) aimed at improving STEM education, including Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow for baccalaureate degree courses with teacher certification, a master's degree program for current teachers, and a one-year master's program for STEM professionals. Additionally, a program called Math Now is mentioned to enhance math instruction for teachers.

The curr_chunk discusses existing NSF programs aimed at enhancing STEM education, such as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship, Math and Science Partnerships, STEM talent expansion program, Advanced Technological Education program, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program. The America COMPETES Act programs managed by the DOE and its National Laboratories aim to enhance K-12 STEM education. The Administration opposes some DOE-Managed STEM initiatives, arguing they should not be DOE's responsibility. Proponents believe inspiring children to learn math and science is crucial, and these programs can help achieve that goal. The Administration opposes DOE-managed STEM initiatives like Summer Institutes and National Laboratories Centers of Excellence, arguing they should not be DOE's responsibility. Proponents believe that inspiring children to learn math and science is crucial, and DOE specialty schools for math and science can help achieve that goal by providing students with a high-quality STEM curriculum. The Administration opposes DOE-managed STEM initiatives, arguing they should not be DOE's responsibility. Supporters believe specialty schools for math and science can be a \"nucleus of excellence\" in STEM education, attracting the best students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. Proponents argue that these programs make a remarkable difference in education quality. The Administration opposes DOE-managed STEM initiatives, arguing they should not be DOE's responsibility. Proponents believe that establishing school-based centers for STEM education is beneficial, despite the Administration's concerns about diverting resources from national laboratories. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes existing STEM programs, including summer internship initiatives at DOE national laboratories. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes existing STEM programs at NSF and authorizes a new program. The Administration opposes increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and establishing funding for the Laboratory Science Pilot program. NSF is responsible for promoting quality math and science education across the United States. The NSF, through programs like the Noyce Program, promotes quality math and science education to support competitiveness in the 21st century. Increasing highly qualified K-12 math and science teachers is crucial for fostering innovation. The National Academies' report emphasizes expanding programs to enhance undergraduate education for future science and engineering workforce. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program to support STEM undergraduate and postgraduate students. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program, bringing the total to $15,000,000. The program aims to encourage STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers by providing scholarships and stipends in exchange for service in high-need school districts. This initiative is based on successful programs like UTeach and California Teach. The program aims to better prepare teachers for the classroom by training them in science and mathematics departments, rather than education departments. It also involves master K-12 classroom teachers as role models and requires universities to shift their focus from research to education careers for students. The program aims to shift universities' focus from preparing students solely for research careers to also preparing them for education careers. It authorizes a new program at NSF to provide grants for professional science master's degree programs emphasizing practical training for high-need fields. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program aims to provide grants for professional science master's degree programs that focus on practical training for high-need fields. Approximately 120 PSM programs at 60 institutions offer two years of academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications, developed with industry guidance. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program aims to improve school laboratories and STEM instruction through grants for partnerships of educational institutions, agencies, businesses, and nonprofits. It includes professional development for teachers, equipment purchase, instructional program development, and hands-on laboratory experiences to enhance the quality of STEM education. A National Research Council report highlighted the poor quality of current high school laboratory experiences. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve STEM education. This includes the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program, which provides grants to increase the number of STEM teachers with training in STEM fields. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. The Math Now program aims to enhance math instruction for elementary and middle school students by offering research-based tools and professional development to teachers. The America COMPETES Act includes provisions for improving STEM education, such as establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act directs the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee. The act also calls for a National Science and Technology Summit to assess U.S. STEM enterprises, held in August 2008. OSTP is required to include a description of these activities in the annual budget submission. The America COMPETES Act mandates a National Science and Technology Summit to evaluate U.S. STEM enterprises, held in August 2008. OSTP is required to include a description of these activities in the annual budget submission. Additionally, the Act directs OSTP to develop principles for open data exchange among federal scientists and engineers. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of open communication of scientific research conducted by federal civilian agencies, promoting a culture of scientific openness. NASA's science communications policy is highlighted as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak to the press and public about their work. The NASA science communications policy serves as a model for federal agencies, promoting openness for employees to speak to the press and public about their work. The America COMPETES Act outlines actions designated for OSTP, including studies on innovation barriers and coordination of research infrastructure. Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was discussed in a Senate hearing on February 12, 2009. Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was confirmed on March 19, 2009. During his nomination hearing, he emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress. If confirmed as OSTP Director, Dr. Holdren will prioritize ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress. He will work to prevent censorship or distortion of scientific information for ideological reasons, in line with the America Competes Act. The Office of Science and Technology Policy is tasked with developing principles to ensure open communication of data and research findings from federal scientists, preventing suppression or distortion. President Obama's memorandum on Scientific Integrity assigns OSTP the responsibility for maintaining integrity in scientific processes within the executive branch. President Obama assigned the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) the responsibility for ensuring scientific integrity in the executive branch. Within 120 days, the Director of OSTP was tasked with developing recommendations for Presidential action to guarantee scientific integrity based on key principles. These principles include selecting candidates based on knowledge and integrity, establishing rules for scientific processes within agencies, and ensuring scientific information in policy decisions follows established processes. Each agency should have rules and procedures to ensure scientific integrity. Scientific or technological information in policy decisions should undergo well-established processes, including peer review. Agencies must make findings available to the public, except for restricted information. Procedures should be in place to address compromised scientific processes or information integrity. Each agency must ensure scientific integrity by having procedures in place to address compromised scientific processes or information integrity. Agencies should make all necessary information available to inform recommendations to the President. Coordination with the Director is required for developing interim procedures to ensure the integrity of scientific decision-making. The Director must coordinate with agencies to develop interim procedures for scientific decision-making integrity. For more details, refer to CRS reports on America COMPETES Act funding. The combined funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act led to funding of several America COMPETES Act programs at authorized levels. Some programs were funded below authorized levels, posing challenges for institutions and individuals sponsored by certain programs. The lack of enumerated appropriations in FY2009 posed challenges for institutions and individuals sponsored by certain programs, especially in research and education. The budgets proposed by both the Bush and Obama administrations did not align with the America COMPETES Act, making it difficult to determine the status of programs. Insufficient evidence exists to confirm funding for new America COMPETES Act programs. The America COMPETES Act programs lack confirmed funding for new initiatives such as DOE Pilot Program, National Energy Education Development, and Early Career Awards for Researchers. Congress faces challenges in determining the funding levels for these programs in the FY2010 appropriation. The America COMPETES Act programs face funding challenges for new initiatives in the FY2010 appropriation. The Obama Administration requested funding for R&D programs at levels below that authorized, but contends that FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations would fund federal R&D programs at the highest levels in U.S. history. Several newly authorized programs have not received funding, raising questions about their establishment. The America COMPETES Act provides authorization levels only through FY2010. The America COMPETES Act programs face funding challenges for new initiatives in the FY2010 appropriation. The Obama Administration has not proposed funding for authorized programs, raising questions about their establishment and success in improving competitiveness through research and development. Funding for these programs remains uncertain beyond FY2010. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the United States' first-place ranking in international competitiveness despite increasing science and technology investments by other nations. Evaluation mechanisms and longitudinal analysis are used to assess competitiveness by comparing the US with other countries. Evaluation mechanisms and longitudinal analysis are used by international organizations to assess the United States' competitiveness compared to other countries. There are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness, as numerous indicators of innovation activity are available, but adding them together may not accurately assess innovation or competitiveness. Other factors like necessity or serendipity also play a critical role in evaluating the quality of innovation and its contribution to economic growth. The evaluation of innovation and competitiveness is complex and not solely based on research and development funding. Factors like necessity, serendipity, market demand, and minor alterations in products also contribute to innovation. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all play a role in funding R&D and innovation. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities fund R&D and innovation. Innovation measures often focus on research and development funding without differentiating between the two. University-industry cooperation is critical in bridging basic research and industry. Analyzing non-defense R&D funding is important for comparing countries. In analyzing industry R&D, factors such as funding allocation between research and development, and investment in specific sectors play a crucial role. Patent data may indicate innovation levels, but not all outcomes of R&D can be patented. Some entities choose not to patent to maintain confidentiality. The focus of government policy is on creating an environment where innovation can flourish, leading to competitiveness with other nations. Both international and U.S. government monitor innovation. The United States government focuses on creating an environment for innovation to flourish, ensuring competitiveness with other nations. Monitoring and assessing the impact of policies is crucial for making necessary adjustments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a key role in monitoring and advising on global trends in innovation and competitiveness. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness advises on global trends in innovation, monitors implementation of public laws, and recommends improvements for innovation, talent development, investment, and infrastructure. It also evaluates specific research and education programs like ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation. In research and education, federal programs like ARPA-E and Discovery Science Institutes are evaluated for their effectiveness by the National Academy of Sciences and through annual reports to Congress. Evaluation criteria include quality, relevance, and performance, with a focus on improving STEM teaching skills and increasing the number of STEM teachers. Agencies use a merit-based, competitive process to determine funding for research activities, graduate students, and distinguished scientists. The DOE summer institutes and ED STEM programs aim to improve STEM teaching skills, increase the number of STEM teachers, and enhance student academic achievement.
