REDUCTION OF FICA RATES RESULTING FROM PERSONAL SOCIAL SECURITY SAVINGS PROGRAM. Employee Contribution: Section 3101 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to reduce the tax rate on employees for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance in years following a reduction year. The reduction year is defined as any year after the transition year when the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent. The term 'transition year' refers to the first full calendar year after the termination year. The 'reduction percentage' is the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rate that would result in a 125 percent OASDI rate ratio for that year. The reduction percentage for the reduction year would have been 125 percent if the rate under subsection (a) and section 3111(a) had been applicable, and the rate under section 1401(a) were twice that rate. The OASDI rate ratio is the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund divided by the amount paid from the Trust Funds for all authorized purposes in a calendar year. The OASDI rate ratio is calculated based on the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund divided by the amount paid from the Trust Funds for all authorized purposes in a calendar year.

Section 1401 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subsection for reducing the tax rate under subsection (a) in specific years. The terms 'reduction year' and 'reduction percentage' are defined in section 3101(d). The reduction in the tax rate imposed under subsection (a) shall not cause it to be less than 4.95 percent. The tax rate imposed under subsection (a) can be reduced in specific years by the reduction percentage defined in section 3101(d). The reduction cannot cause the tax rate to be less than 9.9 percent."
