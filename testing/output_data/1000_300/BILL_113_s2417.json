Any person who is a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal cannot be hired by a Member or committee of Congress within 6 years of leaving that position, unless waived by the Committee on Ethics or the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for a compelling national need. The determination of substantial lobbying contact considers whether the individual's lobbying activities relate to pending legislative business. When considering hiring a former lobbyist, Congress must assess if their lobbying activities were related to pending legislative business, earmarks, or federal funding. Social contacts alone do not constitute substantial lobbying contacts. SEC. 6A. REPORTING BY SUBSTANTIAL LOBBYING ENTITIES. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to include reporting requirements for substantial lobbying entities. Substantial lobbying entities must annually report to the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the United States Senate any employees or individuals under contract who are former members of Congress or congressional staff with specific criteria. The filing required by this section mandates disclosing job titles of congressional staff with specific terms, providing job descriptions, work experience explanations, and improving reporting on substantial lobbying entities through a searchable database on lobbyists.gov. The Joint Web site lobbyists.gov will have a database for 'Substantial Lobbying Entities' including qualifying employees, contractors, and consultants. The Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate will provide filings to the District of Columbia US Attorney for oversight on underreporting lobbying activities. The United States Attorney will investigate entities to ensure accurate reporting of Federal lobbying activities by employees, contractors, and consultants. A \"substantial lobbying entity\" is defined as an incorporated entity with more than 3 federally registered lobbyists. SEC. 7 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to increase penalties from $200,000 to $500,000."
