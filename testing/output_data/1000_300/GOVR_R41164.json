NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive grant program called BTOP, while RUS received $2.5 billion for broadband grants and loans, with a focus on rural areas. The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) allocated $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations, with a focus on serving rural areas. P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money from NTIA. There were two rounds of ARRA broadband funding, with the first round announced in July 2009. The ARRA broadband funding rounds allocated $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations. $302 million of unobligated BTOP money was rescinded. Two funding rounds were announced in July 2009 and January 2010, with all funds awarded by September 30, 2010. Projects included last mile and middle mile broadband infrastructure. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) offered grants and loans for various project categories such as last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Last mile projects focused on providing broadband service to end users, while middle mile projects included interoffice transport and backhaul. Public computer centers aimed to provide broadband access to the general public, and sustainable broadband adoption projects aimed to increase demand for broadband services. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) offered grants and loans for various project categories such as last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Projects could focus on last mile remote areas, last mile nonremote areas, or middle mile infrastructure. NTIA and RUS received over 2,200 applications requesting nearly $28 billion in funding during the first round application period, which was seven times the available funding. During the first round of funding for the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP), over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding, which was seven times the available amount. The second round announced $4.8 billion in total funding, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. Changes were made to streamline the application process based on feedback from the first round. In response to feedback from the first round of funding, NTIA and RUS made significant changes for the second round of BTOP and BIP. Each agency had its own separate NOFA, with the option to apply to either BTOP or BIP. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for middle mile projects serving anchor institutions. BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. In the second round of BTOP and BIP funding, significant changes were made. BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" project category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all last mile and middle mile projects. Eligible infrastructure projects no longer needed to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas. BIP projects were required to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. BTOP projects required only an eligible entity, a completed application, and a 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered during application evaluation. BIP introduced three new grant programs. In the second round of funding, BIP required a 20% nonfederal match for eligible entities with completed applications. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered during evaluation. BIP introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications totaling $11 billion in federal funding requests, while RUS received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in funds. In the second round of funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. This was 26% less than the first round in terms of applications and 21% less in funding requested. RUS also received applications for Satellite Projects, Technical Assistance, and Rural Library Broadband. All BTOP and BIP award announcements were completed by October 1, 2010. On August 30, 2010, RUS announced receiving 27 Satellite Projects, 51 Technical Assistance, and 2 Rural Library Broadband applications. By October 1, 2010, all BTOP and BIP award announcements were finished, totaling 553 projects with $7.5 billion in federal funding. This included 233 BTOP projects ($3.9 billion) and 320 BIP projects ($3.6 billion), with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdown by project category, broadband technology, and state distribution was derived from various sources. Table 2 and Table 3 provide breakdowns of broadband infrastructure funding awards data by project category and program. Approximately half of the funding (51%) was awarded to middle mile projects, while 49% went to last mile projects. Last mile projects received the majority of loan funding (93%) as they were predominantly funded by BIP. Various technologies such as fiber, wireless, cable modem, DSL, and satellite were used for broadband infrastructure deployment. The majority of loan funding (93%) was awarded to last mile projects, with 56% of all infrastructure projects funded being fiber projects. Projects involving fiber technologies account for about two-thirds of all infrastructure projects. Among last mile project technologies, 47% are fiber, 23% are DSL, 17% are wireless, and various other technologies were also used. State-by-state breakdowns of funding are provided in Table A-1 and per capita funding by state in Table A-2. The funding breakdown for broadband projects includes 3% cable modem, 1% satellite, and the rest undetermined. Tables in the Appendix show state-by-state funding breakdowns. Projects must be completed within three years. NTIA and RUS will monitor project progress. Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA grant management office in FY2011 budget proposal. Funding mainly went to last mile projects, with fiber projects receiving 56% of infrastructure funding. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in its FY2011 budget proposal. Additionally, NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability and adoption. The 112th Congress is expected to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects. Funding for the contract was obtained through the Department of Interior's National Business Center. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects, including broadband deployment in unserved areas. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband. Insights from funded BTOP and BIP projects could inform decisions on whether to continue, modify, reduce, expand, or eliminate broadband grant and loan programs within a national broadband policy framework."
