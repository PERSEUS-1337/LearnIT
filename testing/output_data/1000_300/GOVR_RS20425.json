Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via satellite dishes. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in the same market area, in addition to distant network signals. The distinction between local and distant network signals is crucial for understanding SHVIA. The original SHVA established the \"Grade B\" contour as the determining factor for eligibility to receive distant network signals via satellite. Consumers inside the Grade B contour were not allowed to receive such signals, while those outside (in \"white areas\") were permitted. Satellite companies sometimes transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to legal challenges by networks. In 1998, court challenges arose when satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to over 2 million consumers having their signals terminated. EchoStar appealed to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. Congress \"grandfathered\" illegal signal recipients as long as they couldn't receive Grade A signals. New subscribers must meet original rules to receive distant network signals. New subscribers must not receive Grade B signal to get distant network signals. FCC determined Grade B standard should still be used. Consumers can seek waiver if not receiving Grade A or Grade B signal. Waiver request goes through satellite company to local network affiliate. No time limit for action. Consumers can apply for a waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite through their satellite company. The local network affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. If the waiver is denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test at no cost to them. The costs of the test are covered by either the satellite company or the affiliate. Consumers may receive distant network signals through satellite at no cost if they do not receive a Grade B signal locally, have an RV or commercial truck with a satellite dish (not a fixed dwelling), or were previously receiving illegal signals. Compulsory license was extended for consumers who do not receive Grade B signal locally, have satellite dish on RV or commercial truck, or were receiving illegal signals. \"Local-into-local\" service is permitted by SHVIA for DBS companies, but not mandatory. The law allows DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas, but it is not required. Under the \"must carry\" provision, DBS companies must carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they choose to provide any local station in that market. This does not mean they have to carry local broadcast programming nationwide. Cable companies were already subject to must carry regulations. The must carry provisions for DBS companies went into effect on January 1, 2002. EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets as of October 2004. Both companies plan to add more markets as capacity allows, but many smaller communities do not receive local signals via satellite due to the 210 designated market areas in the United States. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services in various designated market areas (DMAs) in the United States. EchoStar has reached 100 DMAs, covering 83% of the population, while DirecTV aims to reach 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, representing 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure that small and rural areas without access to local-into-local services can still receive local television through other satellite or terrestrial technologies. Compensation for satellite retransmission of television programming is also a significant issue. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers retransmitting distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering further extension and changes to how prices are set for programming. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers retransmitting distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering further extension and changes to pricing. Satellite companies have a permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. The 1999 law extended compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers retransmitting distant network signals until December 31, 2004. It makes must-carry requirements effective for satellites on January 1, 2002. Syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication apply to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision can have their signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. Grade B signal intensity standard is retained for receiving distant network signals. Subscribers unable to receive Grade B signal can receive no more than two distant network signals. The law allows subscribers to receive distant network signals if they cannot receive a Grade B signal, with a limit of two signals per network per day. Consumers can seek waivers from local affiliates for signal strength doubts at no cost. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals is extended until December 31, 2004, with reduced copyright royalty payments for satellite companies. The law extends the compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals until December 31, 2004. It also reduces copyright royalty payments for satellite companies by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. Additionally, it eliminates the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers and allows satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) created a loan guarantee program with a four-person board to select recipients for up to $1.25 billion in loans. Loan guarantees can be used to build systems for consumers to receive local television. The LOCAL Act established a loan guarantee program with a board to select recipients for up to $1.25 billion in loans. The loans can be used to build systems for consumers to receive local television signals, with a focus on serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. The act is technology neutral and the Board issued regulations for the program in December 2003. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program in December 2003. An application period ended in April 2004 with one incomplete application received. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service with funding allocated from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. The Security and Rural Investment Act allocated $80 million for the program through December 31, 2006. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its reports. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required testing for interference to DBS systems. The \"Northpoint provision\" mandates testing for interference to DBS systems in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Northpoint Technology seeks an FCC license for MVDDS to offer TV programming and data services, but interference concerns exist. MITRE Corporation conducted interference tests in 2001, concluding that co-existence would require mitigating techniques. DBS operators and Northpoint have differing views on the report's implications. The FCC decided that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist, but dismissed applications by Northpoint and others to provide MVDDS, opting to auction the frequencies instead. Northpoint objected to this decision and did not participate in the auction, which raised $118.7 million. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Legislation proposed to eliminate auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, including S. 564 and H.R. 1320. Language was included in the Senate-passed version of the FY2004 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill but not in the final version."
