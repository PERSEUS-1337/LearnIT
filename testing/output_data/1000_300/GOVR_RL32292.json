    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with firms outside the country for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss for U.S. workers. Policymakers are particularly worried due to high unemployment rates post-recession. The labor market implications of offshore outsourcing remain unclear, with some attributing job loss to the practice. However, the historical link between economic growth and job creation suggests that the labor market may eventually recover. Offshoring accounted for a small percentage of net job loss in the early 2000s. Offshoring has been linked to job loss, but the labor market has historically recovered from recessions. While some believe offshoring hinders labor market rebound, economists argue it benefits the nation by offering a variety of products at lower prices and expanding markets for U.S. firms. Services offshoring raises questions about these benefits. Offshoring of service activities may benefit companies by lowering input costs, but critics argue that the profits are used for dividends, stock buybacks, and mergers instead of reinvesting in the U.S. economy. The movement of service jobs overseas may have different implications for the labor market compared to production jobs. Factory workers typically have lower education levels, while administrative and professional workers have more education. The offshoring of service activities raises concerns about the impact on college graduates and the adequacy of trade adjustment assistance programs for well-educated office workers losing their jobs. Congress aims to promote U.S. job growth, but the shift in job skills being moved abroad may affect entry-level positions traditionally serving as stepping-stones to higher skilled and higher paying jobs. Some policymakers and public policy community members support measures to encourage U.S. firms to create jobs domestically instead of offshore. They also advocate for trade and labor policies in other countries to benefit U.S. companies and workers in the global marketplace. Some policymakers and public policy community members advocate for U.S. firms to expand employment domestically rather than abroad. They also support trade and labor policies in other countries to level the playing field for U.S. companies and workers in the international marketplace. This report briefly examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies and synthesizes information on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to help policymakers evaluate retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The report examines the history of offshore outsourcing by U.S. companies, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. It discusses how companies moved manufacturing work overseas in response to competition and economic challenges. This information is crucial for policymakers evaluating retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The 2001 recession led U.S. companies to further outsource functions to achieve efficiencies through technological innovations, reducing the importance of physical distance between companies. This shift towards domestic outsourcing of in-house functions is a permanent reorganization of work in the United States. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to achieve efficiencies through technological innovations, enabling offshoring of jobs beyond goods production to services like software coding, credit-card processing, medical scans interpretation, and financial analysis for investors. Other countries also improved their ability to export IT services to the United States. The offshoring of jobs to countries like India, particularly in IT services, was facilitated by events like the Y2K crisis and the abundance of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills in low-wage foreign nations. This trend was driven by U.S. firms turning to foreign companies for code fixes due to a shortage of computer programmers in the late 1990s. The educational systems of low-wage foreign nations are producing a surplus of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills, exceeding local needs. This has allowed U.S.-based companies to fragment tasks across borders, including manufacturing and information services, by outsourcing to countries like China, India, and Eastern Europe. English being the language of the computer industry has enabled IT services to be provided from non-English-speaking, low-wage nations. Companies are fragmenting tasks across borders in manufacturing and information services. This includes relocating intangible production tasks like research, design, management, and IT support to different countries. Offshoring has contributed to increased wage inequality in the United States. Technological change and deunionization have also impacted wage polarization in the 1980s and 1990s. Data on job losses due to offshoring is limited to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended mass layoffs since 2004 underestimates jobs lost to offshoring, focusing on large layoffs at manufacturers rather than service providers. In the third quarter of 2012, over 100,000 workers were separated in extended mass layoffs, with firms reporting few job losses from work moving out of the United States. The BLS series on extended mass layoffs since 2004 underestimates job losses due to offshoring, focusing on manufacturers rather than service providers. In the third quarter of 2012, over 100,000 workers were separated in mass layoffs, with less than 1% of job losses attributed to work moving overseas. Forrester Research projected 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015. Forrester Research forecasted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015. This indicates an increasing trend of transferring service activities overseas, with an average loss of 300,000 jobs per year. Researchers focus on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring and estimating U.S. employment in these activities. Researchers have estimated that over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, have attributes that could allow them to be sent overseas. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support roles like data entry and payroll clerks. The study identified vulnerable occupational groups for offshoring, including office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers. These groups are concentrated in industries like information, finance, insurance, and professional services. A study projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring from 2004-2015. The study identified vulnerable occupational groups for offshoring, including office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers in industries like information, finance, insurance, and professional services. Only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring from 2004-2015, with some metro areas like Boulder, Lowell, San Francisco, San Jose, and Stamford projected to lose more jobs by 2015. Metropolitan areas most vulnerable to offshoring tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high populations. Metropolitan areas vulnerable to offshoring are typically populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT or IT-enabled back-office jobs. Jensen and Kletzer's approach estimated that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries having above-average percentages. In 2000, about 9.4% of total U.S. employment was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries being particularly vulnerable. Jensen and Kletzer ranked service occupations based on their vulnerability to offshoring, considering factors like face-to-face contact, telecommutability, and routine vs. complex activities. They identified occupational groups with a large share of employment in the most offshorable category. The job requires face-to-face contact with others, is telecommutable or involves an IT-enabled work process, and includes routine or complex activities. Jensen and Kletzer identified occupational groups with a large share of employment in the most offshorable category, such as computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, life, physical, and social sciences, business and financial operations, and office/administrative support. They found that service occupations with a higher level of educational attainment were more vulnerable to offshoring. BLS also examined the vulnerability to offshoring of service-providing occupations, out of 515 service occupations. In a study by BLS, service occupations with higher educational attainment were found to be more vulnerable to offshoring. Out of 515 service occupations, 160 were estimated to be susceptible to transfer offshore, with a majority in professional and technical categories. These offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007, and despite their vulnerability, employment in these occupations grew slightly faster than overall service-providing employment between 2001-2007. Wage growth was also comparatively greater in these offshorable occupations during this period. In the 2001-2007 period, employment in offshorable occupations grew slightly faster than overall service-providing employment. Wage growth was also greater in these occupations. However, the 33 most susceptible service-providing occupations to offshoring experienced below average employment and wage growth. These vulnerable occupations range from office and administrative support to professional and related occupations with varying education requirements. Blinder estimated that a majority of U.S. occupations (533) and employed persons (92.6 million in 2004) are non offshorable, while a minority of U.S. occupations (about 200) and workers (almost 30 million) fall in the highly offshorable and offshorable categories. This accounted for 22.2% of U.S. workers in 2004. Blinder estimated that a minority of U.S. occupations and workers, totaling almost 30 million, fall in highly offshorable and offshorable categories. He believed this estimate to be too conservative due to expected technological advances. His moderate estimate includes 25.6% of all U.S. workers, while his aggressive estimate totals almost 40 million workers or 29.0% of all U.S. jobs. Blinder noted that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs and that the correlation between skill and offshorability is minimal. Contrary to common belief, highly offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs, as the correlation between skill and offshorability is minimal. Blinder and Krueger's analysis found that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, suggesting that offshorability is prevalent across various occupations. About one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, with offshorability prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, as well as in industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Concerns about services offshoring may be exaggerated, with only a fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes being realized by 2006. Executives need to learn how to effectively utilize offshore talent to boost productivity, as global salary increases erode the cost advantages of offshore outsourcing. This uncertainty has led to caution regarding the future pace of moving potentially vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad. The management challenge of using offshore talent to boost productivity will become more urgent as global salaries rise, reducing the cost advantages of offshore outsourcing. Some are cautious about moving vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad, with organizations redefining core functions to retain control and knowledge in-house. Many companies are re-insourcing and Dell, for example, brought back help services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Many organizations are re-insourcing and bringing back services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Some U.S. firms are employing IT service providers located in the U.S. to fix software produced abroad. Companies are also returning call center operations and legal support work to the U.S., particularly to rural low-cost areas. \"Reshoring\" has been credited for part of the manufacturing sector's employment rebound since the recession, with some U.S. manufacturers bringing production back from overseas in 2011 due to China's shrinking manufacturing wage and cost advantages. Perry found that about one-fifth of companies brought production back from overseas in 2011 due to China's shrinking manufacturing advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives. Offshore IT service providers alleviated security fears post-9/11, allowing offshoring to continue. Offshore providers of IT services allayed U.S. firms' security fears post-9/11, allowing continued outsourcing. U.S. airline carriers increased outsourcing of maintenance jobs overseas, even for domestic routes. Concerns over unrest in regions led to global software service providers diversifying work locations, including near-shore markets like Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers consider moving work to Canada due to fewer cultural differences. Software services are responding by moving more work to countries like Canada and Mexico to reduce cultural differences with the United States. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. Data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is lacking, with analyses focusing on jobs susceptible to moving overseas. Empirical analyses focus on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring, potentially overstating job losses. Other factors influencing employers' decisions on work location are not considered."
