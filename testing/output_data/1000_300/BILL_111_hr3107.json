    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 to promote atomic energy for peaceful purposes and prevent military use. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's budget. The Technical Cooperation Program provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes through voluntary contributions. The Technical Cooperation Program, funded by member states through the Technical Cooperation Fund, provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. The United States is the largest contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, including Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria, received over $55 million in assistance from 1997 to 2007. The GAO report revealed that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007. In 2008, these countries received over $4.4 million in assistance. Concerns about proliferation persist due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment provided through the Technical Cooperation Program, with specific projects in Iran related to its nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The GAO report highlighted concerns about proliferation risks associated with the Technical Cooperation Program, particularly in countries like Iran. The State Department reported that some TC projects in Iran were directly linked to the development of nuclear weapons, with limited documentation on how these concerns were addressed. The lack of formal mechanisms for obtaining project information and shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures were also noted. The GAO report highlighted concerns about proliferation risks in the Technical Cooperation Program, especially in countries like Iran. The report noted that the IAEA does not exclude countries based on political considerations and that there are no good or bad countries for technical cooperation. Limited information on TC projects and dual-use nature were also identified as issues. The GAO report raised concerns about proliferation risks in the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Program, particularly in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. It questioned the State Department's confidence in preventing TC projects from contributing to weapons development and highlighted limitations in information on TC projects and the dual-use nature of nuclear technologies. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for International Organizations and Programs from being used in certain ways. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and subsequent Acts restricted funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998, and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 also limited funding for IAEA projects in Cuba. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 required the US to withhold funding for IAEA projects in Cuba related to nuclear facilities. The GAO report suggested withholding future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries of concern. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions regarding heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. Resolution 1737 limits technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes, excluding proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. The IAEA Director General reported Iran's significant progress in uranium enrichment, with 7,000 centrifuges and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, raising concerns about the potential for atomic bomb development. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about Iran's nuclear program, citing outstanding issues and Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol for credible assurance. Iran has not provided credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities, and has refused to grant access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing, uranium enrichment research, and mining and milling. The IAEA Director General has reported a lack of cooperation from Iran regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Iran has also failed to comply with resolutions adopted by the IAEA. Iran has repeatedly refused to comply with IAEA resolutions regarding its nuclear program, blocking inspections and denying access to enrichment sites. Iran denied access to its enrichment site at Natanz to IAEA inspectors and refused a request for additional surveillance cameras. In April 2008, the US revealed Syria's secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour, built with North Korea's help, capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. General Michael Hayden stated the Syrian reactor could have produced enough. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour, destroyed in September 2007, could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor, and Syria has not provided requested documentation or agreed to visits to other locations. The IAEA Director General stated that Syria's limited information and access have hindered the agency from determining the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\" is a concise statement indicating a prohibition on the use of funds. No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions within 30 days of this Act's enactment. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to assistance provided to certain countries through its Technical Cooperation Program. If the withholding is not done within 30 days, a similar amount will be withheld from the US assessed contribution to the IAEA. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies these countries no longer pose a threat. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. REPORT. The President must submit a report on the implementation of the Act to congressional committees within six months of its enactment. Definitions are provided in Section 7. Section 7 of the Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific committees in the House and Senate and \"state sponsor of terrorism\" as a government that supports acts of international terrorism."
