    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on the risk characteristics of enrollees. For example, if women's healthcare costs are $100 more on average than men's, insurers could be paid $100 more for women to level the playing field. This would prevent insurers from favoring enrolling men over women due to cost differences. Health care costs vary by more than just gender, and sophisticated risk adjustment models consider factors like age, geography, health status, and family size. Even with advanced models, differences in expected health care spending remain unexplained. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) adjust payments to private health plans under Medicare Advantage based on risk scores, aiming to balance out cost differences between enrollees. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) adjusts payments to private health plans under Medicare Advantage based on risk scores to balance out cost differences between enrollees. Medicare Advantage provides private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Medicare Parts A and B, with a capitated monthly payment adjusted for demographics and health status. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans provide all Medicare benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries in return for a capitated monthly payment adjusted for demographics and health status. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are lower. Payments are based on each plan's bid compared to a benchmark set by the federal government. The bid includes administrative costs and profit, reflecting the plan's estimate for covering an average beneficiary. The Medicare Advantage (MA) plans receive payments based on their bids compared to a benchmark set by the federal government. The bid includes administrative costs and profit, reflecting the plan's estimate for covering an average beneficiary. CMS adjusts payments to plans based on the characteristics of the enrolled Medicare beneficiaries, such as age, gender, and health history. The current MA risk adjustment methodology uses demographic and health factors to adjust payments to plans based on beneficiary characteristics like age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. CMS estimates next year's healthcare expenditures by considering these variables in the current year. The MA risk adjustment methodology incorporates demographic and health factors like age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability to adjust payments to plans. Health status is determined by diagnosis using ICD-9-CM codes, which physicians submit for Medicare reimbursement. ICD-9-CM codes are used for Medicare reimbursement, with over 13,000 codes organized into diagnostic groups and condition categories. The codes have a hierarchical structure where only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are grouped into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, ranging from Acute Myocardial Infarction to Coronary Atherosclerosis/Other. The ICD-9-CM Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, with four CCs arranged by clinical severity and cost. Hierarchical coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement, with only 70 HCC codes currently incorporated into the CMS model. Hierarchical coding in the CMS model is based on 70 HCC codes that predict Medicare expenditures. In 2012, 87 HCC codes will be included. ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes to determine reimbursement. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC code. The CMS model uses HCC codes to predict Medicare expenditures, with not all diagnoses resulting in an HCC. Some conditions, like chest pain and ankle sprain, are excluded from the model as they are not chronic or short-term illnesses. The model aims to explain next year's expenditures and focuses on chronic conditions. The CMS model uses HCC codes to predict Medicare expenditures, focusing on chronic conditions. Short-term illnesses are excluded as they are not good predictors of future expenditures. The risk score is calculated based on individual risk factors, with a monthly base rate used to determine the total estimated annual payment. The risk score, based on individual risk factors, is multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to calculate the risk-adjusted base payment. Interaction effects between certain diseases can result in higher healthcare costs than just their additive effects. For example, having both diabetes and congestive heart failure can lead to higher costs than expected. The CMS-HCC model incorporates interaction effects between certain diseases and disability, leading to higher healthcare costs than just their additive effects. Payments to MA plans are adjusted based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses using a mathematical model in the CMS-HCC model. The CMS-HCC model uses a mathematical model to adjust payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses, including interactions between certain diseases and disability. The model predicts expenditures using diagnoses and demographic variables, with relative risk factors periodically recalculated using current claims data. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on demographic characteristics and diagnoses. Risk scores reflect individual health status and likely costs, allowing for personalized payment adjustments. CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on risk scores that reflect individual health status and likely costs. New enrollees' rates are determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. \"For new enrollees in Medicare Advantage, rates are based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses. CMS collects information from MA plans to update the risk score of each beneficiary.\" The Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) allows CMS to update risk scores of MA beneficiaries using encounter level data with ICD-9-CM codes. Risk scores are adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1 based on data from the prior 12-month period. No diagnosis data from the service year is used for payment adjustments. The risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments are based on data from a prior 12-month period, with no diagnosis data from the service year used for adjustments. Errors in age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease can affect payment calculations. Plans are responsible for providing accurate health status information to CMS for audit purposes. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans to ensure that risk-adjusted payments are supported by medical records. Previously, audits only targeted sampled enrollees, but in 2011, CMS proposed extrapolating error rates to the entire plan contract, aiming for $2.27 billion in savings over five years. CMS proposed to extrapolate the RADV error rate to the entire plan contract for the year, estimating savings of $2.27 billion over five years. The final notice of payment error calculation methodology was released in February 2012, stating that audits will be conducted at the contract level. Plans may push back against potential recoveries, making audits problematic for some Part C plans. CMS conducts audits at the contract level, using a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. A sample size of 201 enrollees is deemed sufficient, drawn from eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an MA contract for the entire data collection year. Enrollees must meet specific criteria to be included in the sample. Enrollees in the MA contract must meet specific criteria to be eligible for sampling, including continuous enrollment for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, full Medicare Part B coverage, and a diagnosis leading to CMS-HCC assignment for risk-adjusted payments. The validation HCCs for sampled enrollees are used for risk-adjusted payments in MA contracts. Enrollees are divided into three groups based on risk scores, with 67 enrollees randomly selected from each group. Sampling weights ensure each group is represented in the sample. The group consists of 67 enrollees randomly drawn from one-third of eligible enrollees. Sampling weights are constructed to represent the group they were drawn from. Enrollee sampling weights are used to scale-up sample payment error findings to the population. MA plans are informed of audited enrollees and their HCC codes to provide evidence from medical records. The MA plan is instructed to provide evidence from medical records for audited enrollees and their HCC codes. They have 12 weeks to submit medical records for sampled enrollees. The CMS contractor reviews the records to verify diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments. Discrepancies can be appealed for further examination. The CMS reviews medical records to verify diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments. Discrepancies can be appealed for further examination, with the final decision binding unless a review by the CMS Administrator is requested. Payment errors for each enrollee can result in either overpayment or underpayment. Underpayments cannot be supported by submitting additional medical records. The risk scores for sampled enrollees are corrected based on supported HCCs from RADV medical record reviews. Payment errors are calculated for each enrollee, with underpayments not supported by additional medical records. Payment errors can be positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment) and are calculated based on enrollment months in the MA contract. Total payment errors for sampled enrollees are used to estimate payment errors for each MA contract. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The weighted enrollee payment errors are then summed to determine the estimated payment error for the MA contract. The payment recovery amount for audited MA contracts is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster to address methodological concerns. The fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster in RADV audits addresses methodological concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. Payment errors for each sampled enrollee are extrapolated to the contract by weighting and adjusting for time in the plan. The total error for each enrollee is then summed at the plan level. The fee-for-service adjuster in RADV audits calculates payment errors for sampled enrollees by weighting and adjusting for time in the plan. The total error for each enrollee is then summed at the plan level, with a 99% confidence interval for the estimated plan error. In a hypothetical example, the estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50, with a confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. If the confidence interval includes $0, the recovery amount would be constrained to $0. The RADV audit determines payment errors for Medicare Advantage plans with a confidence interval of 99%. If the interval includes $0, the recovery amount is $0. Adjustments are made by a fee-for-service adjuster, but no additional payments are made to MA plans. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage based on recent studies and research by MedPAC. Recent studies and research by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) have raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage. Plans may manipulate screening efforts to enroll beneficiaries with below-average costs, leading to potential payment discrepancies. Recent studies by MedPAC have highlighted concerns about Medicare Advantage plans enrolling beneficiaries with below-average costs, potentially leading to payment discrepancies. Stakeholders, including the American Academy of Actuaries, have expressed worries about the audit process and the accuracy of CMS's risk adjustment model. The American Academy of Actuaries expressed concern about the CMS's proposed RADV sampling and error calculation methodology for Medicare fee-for-service data. They worry that the methodology may not accurately adjust premiums to reflect the risk profiles of actual enrollees, creating inconsistency in how risk adjustment factors are developed and applied. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply those factors only to MA data that are validated, leading to potential inconsistencies in payment for diabetic members if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic. This could result in understated risk scores for certain conditions. Enrollees no longer considered diabetic in FFS data may lead to inadequate payment for diabetic members in MA. Data inconsistency can result in systematic underpayment and payment inequities, undermining the risk adjustment system. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency leading to underpayment and payment inequities in MA plans. The notice of final calculation methodology includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address these concerns. The notice of final calculation methodology includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address concerns about data inconsistency and payment inequities in MA plans. Risk adjustment aims to compensate MA plans for enrolling sicker or healthier Medicare beneficiaries, but concerns have been raised about using Medicare fee-for-service data for this purpose. Some plans fear that RADV audit recoveries may pose financial risks. The Secretary's approach to addressing methodological concerns remains to be seen. The risk adjustment coefficients for Medicare Advantage plans are audited for accuracy, with concerns raised about potential financial risks from RADV audit recoveries. Different models have been used over the years to calculate risk adjustment for private plans under Medicare, each increasing in complexity and explanatory power. The Secretary's approach to addressing methodological concerns in implementing risk adjustment remains to be seen. The text discusses risk adjustment models used to adjust Medicare private plan payments, with Table A-1 showing the models, years in use, and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The R2 measures how well a model explains beneficiary expenditure variations, ranging from $0 for healthy beneficiaries to high amounts for ill beneficiaries. The models aim to predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics. The R2 quantifies how well risk adjustment models predict beneficiary spending based on characteristics. The AAPCC model explains 0.77% of expenditure variation, with newer models improving to 12.5%. Prior to 2000, private plan payments were risk-adjusted under Medicare programs. Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) models prior to 2000 accounted for demographic characteristics such as age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These variables explained less than 1% of expenditure variation. Payments to individual plans were not adjusted for enrolling very ill beneficiaries, but overall private plan enrollees were healthier. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology that considered beneficiary health status by 2000. The Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model was used from 2000 to 2003, taking into account the worst principal inpatient diagnosis associated with any hospital admission. This model aimed to address the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. The PIP-DCG model, used from 2000 to 2003, considered the worst principal inpatient diagnosis associated with hospital admission to explain Medicare expenditures. However, it had limitations such as not counting illnesses with high expenditures but no hospital admission and potentially reducing risk-adjusted payments for better chronic disease management. Legislation maintained a 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method phase-in schedule through 2003 to ease the financial impact on M+C organizations. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which considers severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. The model incorporates information from various healthcare settings and compensates for the most severe manifestation reported. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. Updates to the model account for changes in diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data, increasing the percentage of variation explained in Medicare expenditures. The update to Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model increased the predictive power of the model to approximately 12.5% by incorporating updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data. This version also underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. Version 21 is set to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
