    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The proposal aimed to amend the Clean Air Act with emission caps on electric utility emissions, implemented through a tradeable allowance program in two phases: 2010 and 2018. A modified version of Clear Skies was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131 by Senator Inhofe, sparking debates on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme. The Clear Skies proposal introduced by Senator Inhofe focuses on cap-and-trade provisions for emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. EPA's approach aims to reduce costs and increase certainty for industry, regulators, and consumers. The proposal interacts with the Clean Air Act through regional cap-and-trade programs already in place for NOx emissions control. The Clear Skies proposal introduced by Senator Inhofe focuses on cap-and-trade provisions for emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations to achieve reductions over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. The proposal aims to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. EPA believes certain CAA provisions are no longer necessary with Clear Skies. The Administration's Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations under the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources. EPA believes that certain provisions like New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain could be eliminated and combined into a new regulatory process. EPA Administrator Whitman stated that depending on the targets set, these regulations may no longer be necessary. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations under the Clean Air Act for electric generating units and industrial sources. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the structure of the Clean Air Act is examined, particularly with respect to Title I and utility planning and operations. Distinctions arise based on factors such as the facility's location, age, and fuel type. The Clean Air Act, established in 1970 and expanded in 1977, remains the backbone of the Act despite the addition of Title IV in 1990. Title IV, which introduced a cap-and-trade program for controlling SO2 emissions, did not alter the basic requirements of the Act. Distinctions in utility planning and operations are influenced by factors such as the facility's location, age, and fuel type. The regulatory structure applies to SO2, NOx, and particulate matter, with specific requirements differing for each. Title IV in 1990 did not change the basic requirements of the Clean Air Act. It established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for major polluting facilities. NAAQS are set for six pollutants to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. EPA reviews NAAQS periodically based on the most recent health data. The Clean Air Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six pollutants to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. EPA reviews NAAQS periodically based on the most recent health data. States are responsible for implementing the standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs), focusing on reducing emissions to ensure compliance. New sources must install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions from increasing. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to require new sources to install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology, along with \"offset\" rules to ensure overall emissions do not increase. LAER is based on the most stringent emission rate without regard to cost or energy use. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. EPA sets NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM10, reviewing the standards every eight years. The Clean Air Act mandates NSPS for major new stationary sources of air pollution, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. EPA sets standards for SO2, NOx, and PM10 every eight years. Interstate pollution is addressed through mechanisms like the NOx SIP Call, Ozone Transport Commission, and state petitions under Section 126. The NOx SIP Call controls emissions from 20 states and the District of Columbia. The NOx SIP Call is a major interstate regulatory regime controlling NOx emissions from 20 states and the District of Columbia. States are given emission budgets to achieve as they choose, with EPA encouraging implementation through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are mostly free from controls. Major new sources, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, are subject to NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 CAA introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution concentrations based on classification, with Class I areas having very little degradation allowed. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III. The PSD program allows for some increase in pollution concentrations based on classification, with Class I areas having very little degradation allowed. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, permitting degradation up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined by state permitting agencies on a case-by-case basis. The regional haze program complements the PSD program by focusing on visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas due to air pollution. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 must install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART). The EPA's 1999 regional haze program imposes stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. Table 1 outlines current air quality control requirements for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities under Title I. The EPA implemented a regional haze program with stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The program also addresses hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as mercury, with two phases of regulations including Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources and additional regulations for residual risks from HAPs. The EPA implemented a regional haze program with stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, addressing hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like mercury through two phases of regulations. The first phase involves MACT standards for major sources, while the second phase, eight years later, may introduce additional regulations to address residual risks from HAPs. Electric utilities received special treatment under Section 112, requiring EPA to report to Congress on public health hazards from their emissions before issuing MACT standards. EPA initially found MACT necessary in December 2000 but later proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 in January 2004. In January 2004, the EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 as its preferred approach, rescinding its previous conclusion on the necessity of the MACT standard. States have the authority to implement stricter standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations, with some states already doing so. Clear Skies would make numerous changes to current laws, including adding new authorities and programs. Table 2 summarizes the current requirements imposed on fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities by Section 112. Clear Skies would change numerous provisions of current law, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension and revision of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and modifications to certain provisions such as BART, Section 126, and conformity. Additional authorities would include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, statutory national emission standards for new and reconstructed electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed changes under Clear Skies would include establishing cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, national emission standards for new EGUs, and creating a \"transitional area\" category. Additionally, major sources would no longer be considered as affected EGUs and opt-in units, and there would be changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions and Section 126. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include establishing cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, national emission standards for new EGUs, and creating a \"transitional area\" category. Changes also involve removing utilities and opt-in units from sources controlled under MACT for mercury emissions, establishing a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, reducing noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preempting state requirements for NOx and mercury, eliminating NSR for major source modifications, and removing BART requirements for visibility protection. Additionally, a 50 km zone around Class I areas would be established for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration. Clear Skies proposes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It includes national emission standards for new EGUs and a \"transitional area\" category. Other changes involve removing utilities from MACT control for mercury, a moratorium on interstate air pollution petitions, reducing noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 program, preempting state requirements for NOx and mercury, and eliminating NSR and BART requirements. Additionally, a 50 km zone around Class I areas would be established for PSD. Clear Skies proposes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It includes emission caps for EGUs in two phases and trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 caps for EGUs are set at 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowance trading program provisions are similar to existing Title IV program. The S. 131 Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are set at 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated free to EGUs based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. New units would have a small pool of allowances set aside. National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from new and reconstructed EGUs would be established under Clear Skies, with more stringent standards. National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from new and reconstructed EGUs under Clear Skies would have more stringent standards compared to current NSPS, with allowances set aside for new units. The Hg standard is stricter than proposed MACT for certain units but allows more emissions for others. The National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions under Clear Skies would be reviewed every eight years. S. 131 allows non-utility units to opt into the cap-and-trade program based on their emissions and output. Units would receive allocations equal to 70% of their baseline SO2 and NOx emissions. Alternative methods for determining allowances for units based on heat input or product output and emissions during optional base periods. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would receive allocations equal to 70% of baseline SO2 and NOx emissions starting in 2010, and 50% starting in 2018. Mercury allocations would be based on federal or state hazardous air pollutant standards. Units opting in would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations and could be permanently exempt if EPA accepts their application. The ClearSkies proposal includes regulations for industrial boilers, process heaters, combustion engines, and turbines. Units opting in would be permanently exempt from regulations if EPA accepts their application. Opt-in units would not be considered major sources for 20 years. Additionally, a new \"Transitional Area\" category would replace nonattainment designations. The ClearSkies proposal includes regulations for controlling emissions and establishing a new \"Transitional Area\" category to replace nonattainment designations. This change would extend deadlines for reaching attainment and remove statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. EPA modeling shows that many areas could qualify for this transitional status. The ClearSkies proposal aims to extend deadlines for reaching attainment and remove statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. It includes exemptions from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for a 20-year period after enactment. This would exempt affected units from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements, unless located near designated national parks and wilderness areas. The ClearSkies proposal aims to extend deadlines for reaching attainment and remove statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. It includes exemptions from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for a 20-year period after enactment, exempting affected units from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements unless located near designated national parks and wilderness areas. For nonattainment areas, Clear Skies would exempt affected units from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements, limiting additional controls on existing EGUs and opt-in facilities under State Implementation Plans. The Clear Skies proposal aims to extend deadlines for reaching attainment and remove statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. It includes exemptions from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for a 20-year period after enactment, exempting affected units from NSR, BART, and BACT requirements unless located near designated national parks and wilderness areas. Clear Skies would also impose additional controls on existing EGUs and opt-in facilities under State Implementation Plans, with exemptions available for units that meet specific pollution control and combustion practices criteria. Changes to the Hazardous Air Pollutant Provisions of Section 112 would preclude regulation of certain pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, with exceptions for non-mercury hazardous air pollutants based on public health concerns. The Administrator would retain authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from EGUs based on public health concerns and emission controls, with a peer-reviewed study required before imposing controls. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations and MACT standards. The Clear Skies proposal exempts units in the cap-and-trade program from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations and MACT standards. It also introduces changes to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator may grant findings for upwind sources emitting pollutants contributing to nonattainment, requiring shutdown or mandated controls within three years. SIPs subject to Section 126 requirements must have an effective date after December 31, 2014. Factors considered include emissions reductions needed for nonattainment areas, with the Administrator determining required reductions for affected units. The Clear Skies proposal would replace the Clean Air Act's Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. The Administrator must ensure that emission reductions from affected units are cost-effective and improve air quality in nonattainment areas. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. The penalties would be set at $2,000 per ton with no inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. Clear Skies does not preempt states from adopting stricter limits, but prohibits interference with cap-and-trade programs. This could lead to increased emissions in one jurisdiction offsetting reductions in another. The bill also limits Section 126 petitions, potentially burdening states with additional control costs. Additionally, Clear Skies eliminates New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs. The Clear Skies bill eliminates New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs, exempting them from NSR for 20 years. National Emission Standards are established for new EGUs, but not for modified units unless they are reconstructed to a certain extent. Reconstruction is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost of a new unit. The standards do not apply unless it is feasible to meet them economically and technologically. The Clear Skies bill eliminates New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs, exempting them from NSR for 20 years. There is no specific cost criterion for modifications requiring NSR, but it is considered to be below a 50% threshold. BART requirements for major sources in operation between 1962 and 1977 are eliminated. Under Section 169A of Part C of the Clean Air Act, major sources in operation between 1962 and 1977 are subject to BART for visibility protection in Class I national park and wilderness areas. Clear Skies exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART for 20 years. S. 131 requires affected units within 50 km of a Class I area to comply with PSD requirements for new construction or reconstruction. PSD mandates new source permits for major sources within 100 km of Class I areas to ensure no adverse impact on visibility. Under the Clean Air Act, new source permits are required for major sources within 100 km of Class I areas to prevent adverse impacts on visibility. Clear Skies exempts affected units in Class II areas from further emission controls to maintain air quality within specified limits. Nonattainment areas must show compliance with ozone and PM2.5 standards by specific deadlines. Clear Skies introduces a new \"transitional\" area classification for nonattainment areas that can demonstrate attainment of ozone and PM2.5 standards by December 2015. Transitional areas would not face penalties until 2015, but if they fail to meet the standards by then, they would be designated nonattainment by June 2017 and have until 2022 to reach attainment. Ozone transitional areas would be exempt from additional requirements until 2017. The Clean Air Act introduced a transitional area classification for nonattainment areas to achieve ozone and PM2.5 standards by 2015. Failure to meet the standards by 2015 would result in nonattainment designation by 2017, with controls required to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas were exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. Subpart 2 of the Act outlined specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including standards for stationary sources, vehicle inspection programs, and penalties for emissions. The Clean Air Act introduced transitional area classification for nonattainment areas to meet ozone and PM2.5 standards by 2015. Failure to meet standards by 2015 would lead to nonattainment designation by 2017, with controls required for attainment by 2022. EPA proposed to maintain requirements for areas failing to meet the 1-hour ozone standard, allowing them to qualify as \"transitional\" under Clear Skies and potentially roll back statutory requirements if attainment is demonstrated by 2015. Elimination of Conformity Requirements under Section 176 of the Clean Air Act for ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas. The proposed Clear Skies legislation aims to reclassify most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" eliminating the application of conformity requirements until 2018. This legislation would also bring changes to Title I regarding electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. The proposed Clear Skies legislation would reclassify nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" affecting electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Title I under Clear Skies eliminates location as a variable for controlling EGUs, regardless of attainment status. This change extends to the allowance system, allowing trading without restrictions to help areas comply with NAAQS. States' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs is also impacted as they would no longer be considered major sources under Part C and Part D. The proposed Clear Skies legislation would reclassify nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" affecting electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Under Clear Skies, states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs would be eliminated, as they would no longer be major sources under Part C and Part D. Additionally, the legislation would prevent states from restricting allowance trading, impacting their ability to influence the actual emissions of EGUs within nonattainment areas. The state's enforcement mechanism, NSR, would also be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. The Clear Skies legislation would reclassify nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" affecting electric generating units and industrial sources. States would lose the ability to set stringent rules on EGUs and restrict allowance trading, impacting their influence on emissions. The state's enforcement mechanism, NSR, would also be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. Clear Skies introduces a new \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, aiming to achieve compliance by 2015 without additional controls. It also includes provisions to protect Class I areas and allows states to designate areas for protection. The Clear Skies Act introduces a transitional designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, aiming for compliance by 2015 without extra controls. It also includes provisions to protect Class I areas and allows states to designate areas for protection. The Act addresses the issue of EGU age and sets up allowance reserves for new sources to reduce disparities in control requirements. The Clear Skies Act aims to reduce disparities in control requirements by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. Existing sources would have more generous allocation formulas, giving them an advantage over new facilities. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. Unit-specific standards would no longer apply to new or existing Electric Generating Units (EGUs) or industrial sources opting into the cap-and-trade program. This could make it challenging to address areas with high mercury concentrations. States setting stricter standards would not have full control due to restrictions on allowance trading. The Clean Air Act limits state standards on mercury regulation, allowing for allowance trading. The Administrator can address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under strict conditions, with standards not effective before 2018. Former Administrator Whitman questions if Clear Skies' targets justify relaxing Clean Air Act provisions. Former Administrator Whitman has raised concerns about Clear Skies' ability to achieve the NAAQS targets for ozone and fine particulate matter within the current Clean Air Act compliance deadlines. EPA's analysis suggests that additional controls and time may be needed for some nonattainment areas to reach attainment. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, could limit states' options for implementing additional electric utility controls to meet these standards. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, may limit states' options for implementing additional controls to achieve NAAQS targets for ozone and fine particulate matter. Concerns are raised about the unclear reach of Clear Skies and its potential impact on industrial sources and mercury controls, especially in areas with fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. Clear Skies proposal may limit states' control options for reducing mercury emissions, potentially impacting areas with fish consumption advisories due to contamination. The Administration argues that Clear Skies would achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost compared to the Clean Air Act, despite extending compliance deadlines for states. The Clear Skies proposal under the Clean Air Act may limit states' control options for reducing mercury emissions, potentially impacting areas with fish consumption advisories. Clear Skies would extend compliance deadlines for states to achieve air quality standards, allowing for flexibility in using banked allowances but also potentially leading to increased emissions in the long term."
