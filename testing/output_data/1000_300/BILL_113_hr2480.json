    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\" is a heading that introduces the short title, findings, and table of contents of a document. The \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" aims to address musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers, particularly nurses and nursing assistants, caused by patient lifting and transferring. These injuries lead to chronic back pain and high rates of nurses leaving the profession. The physical demands of the nursing profession cause many nurses to suffer from chronic back pain, leading to a high percentage requiring leave from work. Patients are at risk during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning, but using mechanical lift programs can reduce injuries. Assistive patient handling technology has significantly improved patient care. The development of assistive patient handling technology has reduced injuries among nursing staff and health care workers, leading to a decline in lost work days and staff turnover. Health care facilities implementing safe patient handling practices have reported positive results. Facilities implementing safe patient handling technology have seen a decrease in lost work days and staff turnover. Studies show that this technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several states have adopted safe patient handling standards, demonstrating their success. Establishing these standards for healthcare workers is crucial for their health and safety. Injury prevention standard for healthcare workers, including nurses, is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing nursing shortage, and increasing patient safety. The text chunk discusses the Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard. The Secretary of Labor must establish an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within one year of the Act's enactment. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers. The final standard must be issued within two years. The standard will mandate the use of engineering and safety controls for patient handling. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard, to be established within 2 years of the Act's enactment, will require the use of engineering controls and mechanical technology to minimize injuries from manual patient handling by healthcare workers. Alternative measures, including trained lift teams, will be mandated where mechanical technology is not feasible. This standard applies to all healthcare employers and aligns with national safe patient handling guidelines. The standard for safe patient handling in healthcare requires employers to develop a program within 6 months, including hazard identification and control measures. Employers must purchase technology and equipment within 2 years to minimize manual handling injuries. The final standard for safe patient handling in healthcare requires employers to purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment and technology within 2 years. Employers must also involve healthcare workers in developing and implementing the program. The final standard for safe patient handling in healthcare requires employers to involve workers, representatives, and collective bargaining agents in developing and implementing the program. Employers must also establish a data tracking and review program to analyze relevant data and account for instances where safe patient handling technology was not utilized. The final standard for safe patient handling in healthcare requires employers to involve workers, representatives, and collective bargaining agents in developing and implementing the program. Employers must also establish a data tracking and review program to analyze relevant data and account for instances where safe patient handling technology was not utilized. Health care employers are required to consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling and provide education and training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies and technology to health care workers. The final standard for safe patient handling in healthcare requires employers to involve workers, representatives, and collective bargaining agents in developing and implementing the program. Employers must establish a data tracking and review program to analyze relevant data and account for instances where safe patient handling technology was not utilized. Health care employers are required to consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling and provide education and training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies to health care workers. Training should cover musculoskeletal hazards and be conducted by knowledgeable individuals in an interactive format. The health care employer must post a notice explaining safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, training procedures, and health care workers' rights under the Act. The health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of the safe patient handling program, including procedures, technology, equipment, and injury assessment, with input from nurses and other health care workers documented in the evaluation. The evaluation of safe patient handling programs must involve nurses, healthcare workers, and their representatives. Employers must take corrective action based on the evaluation. Healthcare workers have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if it poses a risk to their health or safety. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards to prevent injury to healthcare workers and patients. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. Amendments to the Social Security Act require health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds to comply with safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards. Effective one year after issuance. The amendments to the Social Security Act mandate health care facilities to adhere to safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards, effective one year after the final standard is issued. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. States can still enforce laws that provide equal or greater protections for employees. Health care workers' rights are not affected by this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse\" as an individual licensed to provide bedside care, \"employee\" as anyone employed by a health care employer, \"employment\" as including services provided under a contract, and \"handling\" as actions involving physical movement. The curr_chunk defines terms related to health care workers, employers, and handling actions. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to health care workers, including direct-care registered nurses, independent contractors, and lift teams with specialized training in safe patient handling."
