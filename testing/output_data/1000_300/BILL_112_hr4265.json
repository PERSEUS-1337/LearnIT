    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act\" and includes a surtax on millionaires contingent on the passage of a balanced budget amendment or spending limit amendment. This surtax is added as a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act\" includes a surtax on taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000, imposing a 5% tax. The threshold amount is subject to inflation adjustments annually. The threshold amount for the surtax on taxpayers with income over $1,000,000 is adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it is rounded up. For married individuals filing separately, the threshold amount is half of the standard threshold. The threshold amount for the surtax on taxpayers with income over $1,000,000 is adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment and rounded up to the next highest multiple of $10,000. For married individuals filing separately, the threshold amount is half of the standard threshold. Modified Adjusted Gross Income is calculated by reducing adjusted gross income by the excess of gross income from a trade or business not considered a passive activity with wages paid to at least 1 full-time equivalent. The IRS adjusts the surtax threshold annually for taxpayers with income over $1,000,000. For married individuals filing separately, the threshold is half of the standard amount. Modified Adjusted Gross Income is calculated by deducting gross income from a non-passive trade or business with wages paid to at least 1 full-time equivalent employee. Regulations similar to section 469(l) will determine the income considered for taxation. Nonresident alien individuals have specific rules for income inclusion. The income considered for taxation is determined under special rules, including those for nonresident alien individuals and citizens/residents living abroad. Charitable trusts are exempt from certain provisions. The tax imposed under section 911(d)(6) does not apply to amounts in charitable trusts dedicated to specific purposes outlined in section 170(c)(2)(B). Additionally, this tax is not considered for determining certain credits or for section 55 purposes. Application of this section is contingent on a Balanced Budget or Spending Limit Amendment. The Spending Limit Amendment exempts certain taxable years if a proposed amendment to the Constitution is ratified by the States. If not ratified by September 30, 2012, the section does not apply. The Spending Limit Amendment exempts taxable years if a constitutional amendment is ratified by the States before December 31, 2017. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment in Part VIII imposes a surtax on millionaires. It does not change the tax rate under section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2012."
