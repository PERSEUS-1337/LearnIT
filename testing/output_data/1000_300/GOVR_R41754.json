    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund account. The FY2013 spending includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account, which supports neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities through the CDBG program administered by HUD. Grants are allocated to various communities and states to address local housing and economic development needs. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. This represents 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested by the agency for FY2013. The proposed budget would increase funding for CDF activities by 4.5% or $135 million, including reinstating funding for the regional planning initiative (SCI) and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities from another HUD program. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes a $135 million increase in funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. This increase would be achieved by reinstating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The budget also includes $100 million for the SCI and transfers $35 million from the Self-Help Housing Assistance account to the CDF account. Funding for CDBG formula grants would remain unchanged at $2.948.1 billion. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes a $135 million increase in funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. This increase would be achieved by reinstating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The Administration has requested $2.948.1 billion for the CDBG formula component of the CDF account for FY2013, with specific allocations for entitlement communities, state-administered programs, insular areas, and Indian tribes. Funding for SCI program activities is recommended to be reinstated, after not receiving funding in FY2012. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) program activities were funded at $99 million in FY2011 and are requested to receive $100 million in FY2013. The funds would support planning grants for regional organizations in metropolitan areas to integrate housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. The Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other federal agencies would collaborate on grant awards focusing on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. $46 million in Community Challenge Grants would be competitively awarded to up to 50 communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. $8 million would be allocated for research on the benefits and trade-offs of integration efforts by HUD, DOT, and EPA. Integration Research: $8 million allocated for a joint HUD, DOT, and EPA research initiative to evaluate benefits and trade-offs. $3 million for technical support in developing residential energy modeling system, common energy standards, and sources of funding for energy efficiency improvements. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. The borrowed funds must support job creation and meet the national goals of the CDBG program, benefiting low to moderate-income individuals or addressing urgent threats to residents. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow funds to support job creation and meet national goals. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 to help finance large-scale job creation activities. Additionally, a fee-based assessment may be charged to borrowers accessing the program. The Administration proposes revamping the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program by increasing the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 and implementing a fee-based assessment for borrowers. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants, a 5% increase from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill also supports funding for Indian tribes and SCI activities, with $50 million allocated for SCI activities and $12.5 million for communities with populations under 500,000. Additionally, the bill calls for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill also supports funding for Indian tribes and SCI activities, with $50 million allocated for SCI activities and $12.5 million for communities with populations under 500,000. Additionally, the bill calls for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012, recommending $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012, recommending $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. H.R. 5972 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes but does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for new SCI activities. Instead, it recommends just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards. The House bill H.R. 5972 does not support a set-aside of CDBG funds for new SCI activities. Instead, it recommends just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards. The program is unauthorized and lacks support from the House Financial Services Committee. The bill also recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million and continues funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The House bill H.R. 5972 recommends funding of Section 4 activities at $35 million and loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million. During floor debate, amendments calling for funding reductions or elimination of CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were introduced but not approved. During the second half of 2011, Congress debated budget recommendations for FY2012. Amendments proposing funding reductions for various programs were defeated by votes, including those for the Community Planning and Development account, CDF, and Section 108 loan guarantee program. Another amendment seeking to allocate more funds for demolition activities was challenged and ruled out of order. During the FY2012 budget debate in Congress, supporters of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program emphasized its role in economic development and job creation at the state and local levels. They vowed to defend the program against budget cuts. During the FY2012 budget debate, supporters of the CDBG program highlighted its role in economic development and job creation at state and local levels. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, and transferring SCI to a new account. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, transferring SCI to a new account, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The FY2012 budget recommended a total funding level of $3.804 billion for programs funded under the CDF account, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration also requested an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, and transferring SCI to a new account in the FY2012 budget. The Administration requested $3.684 billion for CDBG grants to states and entitlement communities, $7 million for insular areas, $65 million for Indian tribes, $25 million for Rural Innovation Grants, and $23 million for Guam. Additionally, there was no funding allocated for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, opposing earmarking of funds. They recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with a requested appropriation of $150 million to support Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposed funding for various initiatives to support sustainable communities, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The budget also suggested doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to address credit market difficulties. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. Congress rejected the proposal and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on THUD approved a draft bill on September 8, 2011. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on THUD approved a draft bill on September 8, 2011, recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft report noted the possibility of eliminating the CDBG program, citing it as not a core federal government function. The FY2012 Budget Resolution recommended eliminating the CDBG program, stating it was not a core federal government function. The draft bill suggested states and local communities use more of their own funds for community development activities to increase transparency and accountability. Funding priorities would shift, including reducing CDBG Indian Tribes funding from $64 million to $35 million. The draft bill also rejected the Administration's proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The subcommittee draft bill recommended reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes from $64 million to $35 million and rejected the Administration's proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. It suggested maintaining the current structure and providing $6.8 million in credit subsidies to support $275 million in loan guarantees. Additionally, the bill proposed lowering the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use for administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's CDBG allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's allocation in the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012. The proposed funding for CDF would have decreased to $3.0 billion, with $2.851 billion allocated for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. The Senate bill recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels, and $90 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate three appropriations measures into a Minibus, which was approved by the Senate on November 1, 2011. The amendment approved on October 21, 2011, consolidated three appropriations measures into a Minibus. Senator Coburn's amendment, S.Amdt. 796, aimed to prevent grants from being used to repay federal loans, impacting the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. This could lead to states and communities using CDBG funds to cover revenue shortfalls for bond repayments related to Section 108 loans. The House and Senate reconciled differences in the bill H.R. 2112 through a conference report (H.Rept. 112-284) on November 14, 2011. The approved version of H.R. 2112, signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The act funded core CDBG programs with $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for other programs. The approved version of H.R. 2112, signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The act funded core CDBG programs with $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas. The funding for CDBG formula grants is 10.7% less than appropriated in FY2011, 19.6% less than requested by the President, and 15% less than recommended by the House, but 3.4% more than recommended by the Senate. Other CDF activities funded in previous years were not directly funded for FY2012, but could be carried out with CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The approved version of H.R. 2112, signed into law as P.L. 112-55, allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The decline in CDBG funding and elimination of funding for other programs reflect congressional efforts to reduce federal spending. P.L. 112-55 did not include provisions from the Senate version that would have restricted the use of federal grants like CDBGs. The act did include a provision for a study on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs administered by HUD. The approved version of H.R. 2112, signed into law as P.L. 112-55, reduced the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses from 20% to 10%. It directed the GAO to study the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME programs within 180 days. HUD was required to submit a progress report on grantee accountability within 120 days. Additionally, HUD was directed to analyze the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements of other federal programs. The conference report directed HUD to analyze the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements of other federal programs. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported for the third year in a row. P.L. 112-55 maintained the program's current structure and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in Section 108 loan guarantee commitments. Additionally, the act prohibited states from diverting proceeds from the sale of notes backed by Section 108 loan guarantees to any other community. $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance was included in P.L. 112-55 for FY2012. The $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance included in P.L. 112-55 for FY2012 was to be disbursed to states and local governments for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters by the President in 2011. These funds were to assist in disaster relief and long-term recovery plans, including housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Eligible states and local governments had to submit a disaster recovery plan detailing the use of funds and planned activities. The Disaster Relief Act allowed for funds to be used for disaster recovery efforts, with waivers available for certain CDBG program requirements. $100 million of the $400 million allocated was exempt from spending limits. The Disaster Relief Act appropriated $400 million for disaster relief activities, with $100 million exempt from spending limits. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund, with a mandatory rescission and discretionary transfer reducing the total appropriation to $3.501 billion. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.501 billion for the Community Development Fund, including the formula-based Community Development Block Grant program. This was a 16% reduction from the previous year's funding level. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to further reduce funding for CDBG activities by 62.5%. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion, including the Community Development Fund and the Community Development Block Grant program. Despite Senate rejection, negotiations led to the signing of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. After Senate rejection, negotiations resulted in the signing of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011, which appropriated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. P.L. 112-10 allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account by $7 million, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. Adjusted appropriations for CDF activities are shown in Table 3, along with actual distribution of funds for FY2010, Administration's budget request for FY2011, and projected distribution based on H.R. 1. The CDF account received $3.501 billion in appropriations for FY2010, which is 21.3% less than the previous year and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, which provides formula-based grants to various entities. The CDF account, which includes the CDBG program, received reduced funding for formula grants and Sustainable Communities Initiative activities in the first session of the 112th Congress. The House passed H.R. 1, which proposed significant cuts to the CDF account. The House passed H.R. 1 in 2011, reducing funding for the CDF account by 66.3% and prohibiting funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI). Allocation instructions for the CDBG program were not included in the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee submitted an amendment to H.R. 1, proposing $4.230 billion for CDF activities, including $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 appropriation levels. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1 proposed $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion allocated to the CDBG program. It aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 levels, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. The FY2011 appropriations for CDBG totaled $3.296 billion, a decrease from the FY2010 level. In FY2012, CDBG allocations to entitlement communities and states were $2.942 billion, showing a further decline. The CDBG allocations for entitlement communities and states decreased from $3.943 billion in FY2010 to $2.942 billion in FY2012, resulting in a 10.7% reduction. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined by 29.1% from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012. Additionally, the average state allocation decreased by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. The average state allocation for CDBG funding declined by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012, due to lower appropriations and an increase in qualifying communities. The proposed 62.5% reduction in funding in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting economic development, job creation, public facilities, and services. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have forced states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting economic development, job creation, public facilities, and services, impacting non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded public services. This reduction disproportionately affects low and moderate income households, as communities are required to allocate at least 70% of the program's funds to benefit them. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program allocated at least 70% of funds to benefit low and moderate income persons, the lowest amount in over a decade. This reduction in funding will cause entitlement communities to delay projects and reduce support for community-based organizations. Table 5 shows the distribution of CDBG formula funds awarded to states and entitlement communities for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. The distribution of CDBG formula funds to states and entitlement communities for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 was impacted by legislative acts, resulting in reductions in allocations. 70% of funds are allocated to cities and urban counties meeting population thresholds for eligible activities. In FY2011, CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities and states using Formula A based on population thresholds. 70% goes to cities and urban counties, while the remaining 30% is distributed to small or nonentitlement communities. Formula A, created in 1974, allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors. Formula B, enacted in 1977, includes a population growth lag factor for funding allocation. The Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1977, P.L. 95-128, allocate funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population growth lag, poverty share, and housing built before 1940 factors. CDBG funds distribution to states is governed by a two formula system, Formula A and Formula B, which consider population, poverty, overcrowded housing, and poverty housing built before 1940. The CDBG program allocates funds to states based on two formulas, Formula A and Formula B, which consider factors like population, poverty, overcrowded housing, and housing built before 1940. HUD uses Census Bureau data and American Community Survey estimates to update data sources annually for fund allocation. HUD will use updated Census Bureau data and American Community Survey estimates for FY2012 CDBG fund allocations, allowing for more accurate reflection of demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used older data sources for poverty, housing conditions, and housing stock. A study in December 2011 analyzed the impact of new data sources on fund distribution. The December 2011 HUD study analyzed the impact of using updated Census Bureau data and American Community Survey estimates for FY2012 CDBG fund allocations. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions experienced declines in CDBG allocations due to changes in data sources. Entitlement communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw a decrease in CDBG allocations (-22.6%, -4.9%, and -3.1% respectively) due to changes in data sources. Conversely, communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions would see an increase in allocations (9.5%, 6.8%, and 5.3% respectively). The introduction of new data sources resulted in central cities of metropolitan areas and urban counties receiving a larger share of funds, while funding for other entitlement cities decreased. The report discusses changes in funding allocations for entitlement communities, with some cities experiencing declines while others see increases. States like New Mexico and Puerto Rico face significant funding decreases due to shifts in poverty and housing conditions. The report also includes a comparison of funding allocations for different communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. More information can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf. The report reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, focusing on CDBG formula grants, set-asides, and special appropriations. Total appropriations fluctuated between $3.772 billion to $5.112 billion, with FY2011 seeing the lowest funding in over a decade. Debate surrounds the funding level for the CDBG-formula component of the CDF account. The FY2011 appropriation for CDF activities is the lowest in over a decade. Supporters of the program advocate for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations and the growing number of entitlement communities. Critics argue that increased funding is not justified based on the program's PART score. Critics argue that increased funding for the CDBG program is not justified based on the program's PART score and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to address the federal budget deficit and national debt. From FY2000 to FY2010, the average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7%, but since FY2008, the average allocation has increased by 9% to $2.4 million in FY2010. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities has been fluctuating, with an increase from FY2009 to FY2010 but a decline in FY2011. The average grant amount has increased by 9% since FY2008, reaching $2.4 million in FY2010. However, in FY2011, the estimated average allocation is $1.9 million, 34.5% less than in FY2000. The number of entitlement communities receiving direct allocations has increased from 1,012 in FY2000 to 1,167 in FY2011. In FY2011, the number of jurisdictions receiving CDBG entitlement communities increased by 155 to 1,167. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $19.1 million in FY2011, a 23.3% decrease from FY2000 and 17.7% less than FY2010. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars. The FY2011 average state allocation of $19.1 million is 23.3% less than FY2000 and 17.7% less than FY2010. In inflation-adjusted constant dollars, program funding declined by 40% from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants have fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in the last decade. The CDF includes other programs with smaller appropriations and specific objectives. The CDF account includes set-asides for various objectives, some to complement formula grant programs and others for specific projects. Funding for these set-asides fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with appropriations ranging from $647 million in FY2001 to $61 million in FY2007. In FY2010, $509 million was allocated, with a focus on Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative earmarks. In FY2007, Congress eliminated all earmarks in the CDF account. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $509 million in CDF set-aside activities, with a significant portion targeted to Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI) earmark accounts. For FY2011, funding for EDI and NI earmarked accounts was eliminated. The fluctuation in CDF set-aside funding was due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs, including program funding, transfers, reductions, and earmark programs. See Table A-1 in the Appendix for a detailed listing of set-aside programs from FY2000 to FY2011. From FY2000 to FY2011, CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks fluctuated, with a significant decline in FY2000 to FY2008, a rebound in FY2009 and FY2010, and a significant decline again in FY2011. Earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were the main focus of CDBG-related set-asides, with these programs exclusively used for congressionally earmarked projects. Earmarks have been a topic of debate in recent Congresses. The EDI and NI programs were the main focus of CDBG-related set-asides, exclusively used for congressionally earmarked projects. Earmarks have been a topic of debate in recent Congresses. Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account in FY2007, but subsequently included EDI and NI earmarks in legislation for CDF activities in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2011, Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks. In FY2008 and FY2009, appropriations for EDI and NI were double the amount for other set-aside activities. Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks in FY2011. The CDBG program's framework has been used for supplemental appropriations for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation efforts, as well as for reducing abandoned properties and supporting job creation. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was established to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis and support job creation in response to the economic recession. Funds were provided to states and selected communities to acquire, rehabilitate, and resell foreclosed properties. Disaster relief and NSP funding were allocated based on specific criteria, with CDBG disaster funding only going to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration. In the case of CDBG disaster funding, only communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration receive funds at the discretion of Congress. Each Congress decides if the disaster warrants supplemental CDBG funds beyond FEMA's typical allocation. NSP-1 and NSP-3 allocated funds to states based on mortgage foreclosure rates, subprime loans, and delinquencies. Congress set a minimum grant amount for each state and required funds to be distributed to local governments with high foreclosure rates. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program allocated funds to states based on mortgage foreclosure rates, subprime loans, and delinquencies. States were required to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments with high foreclosure rates. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities, including for-profit partners. Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind funds. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs on March 2, 2011. On March 9, 2011, the committee approved an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. The committee approved an amendment for HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. Representative Miller criticized the program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars, advocating for rescinding funding for NSP-3. Other Members argued that the program has been successful in helping communities combat the negative impacts of foreclosures. During a hearing, HUD's Assistant Secretary stated that the NSP program is expected to impact 100,000 properties in hard-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support over 93,000 jobs nationwide and helps reduce abandoned and foreclosed housing stock. Members debated on rescinding funding for NSP-3, with some arguing it has been successful in assisting communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. The Assistant Secretary testified that the NSP program will support over 93,000 jobs nationwide and help reduce abandoned housing stock. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011, with a vote of 242 to 182. No companion bill has been introduced in the Senate."
