A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, offering privacy guarantees without compromising utility. The method is extended to provide confidence intervals and test statistics, as well as estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function. Empirical evidence from clinical datasets supports the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method offers good utility and strong privacy guarantees in medical analytics. Patient data can be reconstructed from published survival function estimates, leading to sensitive information disclosure. The survival function is used in various domains to model time to an event. The survival function is crucial in many fields such as economics, engineering, and healthcare. Personal healthcare information is highly sensitive and protected by law. Information leakage in healthcare is a serious issue, with a focus on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method, widely used in clinical research. The Kaplan-Meier method is widely used in clinical research for reporting survival statistics. Statistical agencies use this method for general population survival estimates. There is a lack of models providing privacy guarantees for survival function estimation using this method. Previous work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) pertains to regression modeling and is limited in its applicability. Generative models like differentially private methods could potentially address this limitation. The proposed method aims to estimate the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method in a differentially private manner, addressing the limitations of existing regression models. Generative models like GANs are not suitable due to small sample sizes, constrained dimensionality, and data characteristics. This novel approach offers privacy guarantees for survival function estimation. The proposed method offers a differentially private approach to estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. It extends to provide confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy cost and also applies to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees.

Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees. The method is released as an R package for rapid accessibility and adoption, with a focus on accounting for censored observations in the estimation process. In survival analysis, accounting for censored observations is crucial for estimating the survival function. Various methods, including parametric ones like exponential and non-parametric ones like Kaplan-Meier's method, can be used for this purpose. This paper focuses on the latter method, which does not assume how the event probability changes over time. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric method used in survival analysis to estimate the survival function without assuming how event probabilities change over time. It is defined by failure times and the number of failures at each time, resulting in a step function characteristic. Differential privacy is also discussed as a provable privacy notion in the context of randomized algorithms. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric method for survival analysis, characterized by a step function. Differential privacy, a provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms, ensures privacy by behaving similarly on similar input datasets. Differential privacy guarantees are defined by the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-differential privacy parameter, with smaller values providing stronger privacy guarantees. The main property crucial to differentially private survival function estimation is postprocessing. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is used for survival analysis and ensures privacy through differential privacy, with smaller values of (\u03b5, \u03b4) providing stronger guarantees. The main property crucial to differentially private survival function estimation is postprocessing, which states that differential privacy is immune to post-processing. This notion is central to the approach of ensuring that the estimate of the survival function is differentially private. Our method for differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's method ensures differential privacy by following basic principles. It allows for estimating various statistics in a differentially private manner without extra privacy budget. The dataset includes time points, subjects at risk, and subjects experiencing events. The method ensures differential privacy by creating a dataset with event and at-risk numbers at unique time points. A noise matrix is added to the dataset to achieve differential privacy. The algorithm for this process is succinctly presented as Algorithm 1. The method ensures differential privacy by adding a noise matrix to the dataset. Algorithm 1 presents the procedure for creating a dataset with event and at-risk numbers at unique time points. The procedure is simple and requires minimal changes for differential privacy, making it computationally cheap and easily implementable using any software package. The method also provides formal privacy guarantees and can be extended for differentially private estimation of other associated statistics. The method ensures differential privacy by adding noise to the dataset. It provides formal privacy guarantees and can be easily extended for differentially private estimation of other associated statistics. The L1 sensitivity of the method is two, making it computationally cheap. Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise. Theorem 2 proves Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise to ensure privacy of individual components. The method can be easily extended for other essential statistics with formal privacy guarantees. When reporting survival function estimates, including confidence intervals and test statistics is crucial for reflecting uncertainty and comparing group data. Differentially private counterparts for confidence intervals and test statistics are essential for privacy guarantees. Confidence intervals are calculated point-wise at discrete time-points where events are observed. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated point-wise at discrete time-points. The calculations for obtaining these intervals are proven to be differentially private. Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals are commonly used, and their differential private counterparts are obtained using Algorithm 1. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are made differentially private by using Greenwood's formula and Algorithm 1. This ensures privacy without needing additional access to sensitive data. Hypothesis tests can be used to compare survival function estimates between groups, such as infection rates in clinical trials. The Logrank test is differentially private for hypothesis testing on survival function estimates between groups. The test statistic is made differentially private by replacing sensitive information with their private counterparts using Algorithm 1. This ensures privacy without requiring additional sensitive data for estimation. After using Algorithm 1, the test statistic Z and related confidence intervals can be output without using additional privacy budget. In some cases, there may be multiple types of events, such as patients dying before progressing to AIDS in the example of HIV infection. Competing events, like death before progression to AIDS in HIV infection, can impact observations. Competing risk cumulative incidence estimates are crucial in such scenarios to avoid bias. Algorithm 1 extends differential privacy to competing risk situations, ensuring -differential privacy for the cumulative incidence estimate. Using Algorithm 1, differential privacy can be extended to competing risk scenarios, ensuring that the cumulative incidence estimate is -differentially private. This method replaces associated quantities with their differentially private counterparts, making statistics like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests also differentially private. The method extends differential privacy to competing risk scenarios, ensuring differential privacy for statistics like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. The differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is also obtained. Empirical evaluation is conducted on nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. The study evaluates a method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function using nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. Comparison is made with the original non-private version to assess utility and credibility for practical use. The evaluation of a method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function on nine real-life datasets shows that the privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the original function with little utility loss. The estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget. The evaluation of differentially private estimates of survival functions on real-life datasets shows that privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the original function with little utility loss. Small datasets show worse utility due to the need for large noise to protect privacy, while moderate to medium-sized datasets yield good results even in high privacy regimes. The evaluation of differentially private estimates of survival functions on real-life datasets shows that privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the original function with little utility loss. Our method provides precise estimates of median survival time and confidence intervals, even in high privacy regimes. Some cases with high survival rates may have unattainable upper bounds on confidence intervals, marked as \"NA\". The method accurately estimates the median survival time and confidence intervals, even in high privacy regimes. In cases with high survival rates, upper bounds on confidence intervals may be unattainable. The differential private estimation performs similarly to the original non-noisy estimation, maintaining statistical significance thresholds. The method accurately estimates median survival time and confidence intervals, even in high privacy regimes, without changing statistical significance thresholds. Results for cumulative incidence using new datasets with competing risk information show similar estimation accuracy. Detailed results can be found in the Appendix. Previous works have explored differentially private methods for regression modeling. Recent work has focused on the intersection of statistical modeling and differential privacy, with various methods proposed for regression modeling and survival analysis. Differentially private generative models have also been explored, but they are not suitable for survival function estimation. This study presents the first method for differentially private estimation. The study presents the first method for differentially private estimation of survival function and other statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics. Extensive evaluation on nine real-life datasets shows a good privacy-utility trade-off. One dataset used for evaluation is on survival in patients with advanced lung cancer. The datasets used for evaluation include cancer (survival in advanced lung cancer patients), Gehan (leukemia patients), kidney (recurrence times to infection in kidney patients), and maintenance chemotherapy in subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Time is converted into months for analysis. The curr_chunk discusses various datasets related to different medical conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), acute myeloid leukemia, ovarian cancer, and Stanford Heart Transplant data. Time is converted into months for analysis, and groups compared include males and females, treatment arms, different treatment groups, and age groups. The curr_chunk discusses datasets related to medical conditions like primary biliary cirrhosis and liver transplant waiting list. Event variables include receipt of a liver transplant, censor, or death, with transplant as the event of interest and death as a competing event. The second dataset contains data on liver transplant waiting list subjects from 1990-1999, showing outcomes of receiving a transplant, dying while waiting, or being censored. The results indicate that the differentially private extension effectively estimates the competing risk cumulative incidence function while ensuring privacy. Theorem 6 states that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private. The text discusses the differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence functions using sensitivity analysis. It compares probability density functions at arbitrary points and shows that the method provides accurate estimates while ensuring strong privacy guarantees.
