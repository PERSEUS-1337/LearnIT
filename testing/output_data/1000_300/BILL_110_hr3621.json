    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring transportation services from private contractors. This analysis helps determine the cost-effectiveness and public interest in using private contractors or government employees for such services. The Act defines key terms such as \"architectural, engineering, and related services,\" \"private contract,\" and \"government agency\" in the context of surface transportation projects. The Act defines terms like \"government agency\" as a recipient of Federal funds for surface transportation projects, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Transportation. A \"surface transportation project\" includes projects eligible for assistance under title 23, capital projects, and other related projects determined by the Secretary. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services if a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. The analysis must include a description of services and cost estimates. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services if a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. The analysis must include a description of services, cost estimates, and a determination of whether services would be procured more quickly through a private contract. The cost-benefit analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for surface transportation projects must include determining if services would be procured more quickly through a private contract, estimating equipment and material costs, estimating unemployment compensation for displaced government agency employees, and estimating the cost of resuming service under the private contract. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose the results of cost-benefit analyses for private contracts deemed in the public interest at least 30 days before entering into the contract. The results must be submitted for review, provided to registered individuals or entities, and made available for public inspection, including online publication.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMENTS. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nWithin 15 days of a government agency publishing the results of a cost-benefit analysis for a private contract, employees and interested parties can submit written comments disputing the accuracy of the results. Additionally, agency employees can submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature and cannot be performed by government employees to avoid underutilization."
