The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands to reduce the risk of wildfires, protect endangered species, and provide efficiency tools for project streamlining. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" as areas with a high risk of wildfire impacting key ecosystems, wildlife, and habitats on Federal lands. The Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station developed classes for wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests or endangered species habitats. These projects aim to reduce hazardous fuels, improve forest health, restore watersheds, and protect endangered species. Livestock grazing and timber harvest may be included in authorized wildfire prevention projects. Authorized wildfire prevention projects on Federal land may involve activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest to reduce hazardous fuels, improve forest health, restore watersheds, and protect endangered species habitats. Federal land includes National Forest System land and public lands, excluding certain areas. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. Threatened and endangered species habitat on Federal land is defined as areas where natural fire regimes are identified. Threatened and endangered species habitat on Federal land is defined as areas important for endangered or threatened species, or their habitats, where natural fire regimes are identified as crucial or wildfire poses a threat. This definition is based on species recovery plans or Federal Register notices designating species as endangered or threatened. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects must be implemented in at-risk forests and on threatened and endangered species habitat, focusing on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects on endangered species habitat aim to enhance protection from wildfires and comply with relevant guidelines. In at-risk forests, authorized wildfire prevention projects aim to move Federal land towards condition class I. Domestic livestock grazing can be used in these projects to reduce surface fuel loads and recover burned areas, with no utilization standards applying in this context. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, domestic livestock grazing can be used to reduce surface fuel loads and recover burned areas without utilization standards. Timber harvesting and thinning are also permitted to prevent wildfires. The projects do not require revisions to land and resource management plans. Public petitions must be considered within 60 days. The Secretary must review and make a determination on public petitions for designating Federal land as at-risk forest or threatened species habitat within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. Public Notice and Comment: The Secretary concerned must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register. The public can submit written comments within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering received comments. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit further comments. The Secretary must designate the final wildfire prevention project and publish a notice in the Federal Register. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit additional comments related to the final designated project within 30 days. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws and conduct an authorized wildfire prevention project. Interagency cooperation is required as per the Endangered Species Act. The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other laws must be followed in planning and conducting authorized wildfire prevention projects. Interagency cooperation is required under the Endangered Species Act for such projects. Special rules apply to projects involving timber harvesting or grazing, with a deadline for preparing an environmental assessment. The authorized wildfire prevention project must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. If the deadline is not met by the Secretary concerned, the project is deemed compliant. For livestock grazing projects, the environmental assessment is valid for 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for 20 years. The Secretary is not required to study, develop, or describe alternatives. Compliance with this section deems the environmental assessment sufficient for a minimum of 20 years. The Secretary is not obligated to explore alternatives to the proposed agency action. Compliance with this section satisfies various environmental acts. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows a special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. Judicial review is conducted according to the Act as well. SEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS. Before listing species under the Endangered Species Act, research on the impact of listing on forest fuel loads is required. Endangered species recovery plans must include wildfire risk assessments."
