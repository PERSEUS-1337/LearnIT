    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act.\" It includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. The Secretary of Transportation will collaborate with the EPA and the Department of Energy to implement a proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program. Participating employers who engage in telecommuting, defined as using telecommunications to work and reduce commuting, will be involved. Regulated entities under the Clean Air Act with respect to ozone precursors will also be part of the program. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors resulting from reduced vehicle-miles-traveled (VMTs) through telecommuting. The program involves collaboration between the Secretary of Transportation, EPA, and Department of Energy, with participation from employers and regulated entities under the Clean Air Act. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors through telecommuting. Employers can transfer emission credits to other parties and trade them on a commercial forum. The proposed pilot program allows for trading emission credits on a commercial forum. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through direct trades or the forum. These credits can be presented to the Federal Government or State for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The pilot program allows trading emission credits to assist in achieving Clean Air Act compliance. The Federal Government would facilitate credit transfer between employers and entities in specific geographic areas like the District of Columbia and Los Angeles. The pilot program allows trading emission credits in specific geographic areas like the District of Columbia and Los Angeles. The Secretary will select three additional areas for the program after consulting with the grantee. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the chosen geographic area. The Secretary will require the grantee to study and report to Congress and the Secretary in developing the program design. The Secretary will require the grantee to study and report to Congress and the Secretary the potential significance of the proposed pilot program in expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs in the geographic areas. The program's positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life will be evaluated. Authorization of appropriations is provided for making the grant. Authorization of appropriations is provided for making a grant of $250,000 for fiscal year 2000 to study and report on the potential significance of a proposed pilot program in expanding telecommuting and reducing vehicle miles traveled, with a focus on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life."
