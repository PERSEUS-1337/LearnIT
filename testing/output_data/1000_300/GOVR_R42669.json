The use of the military to execute the law is a debated topic regarding the President's implied or inherent constitutional powers. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution, with exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. Congress has authorized the use of the military in three ways: giving armed forces law enforcement authority, establishing general rules for assistance, and addressing individual cases with specific legislation. The Coast Guard has broad law enforcement responsibilities, and statutes allow the President to call out the armed forces in times of insurrection and domestic violence. The Coast Guard, a branch of the armed forces, has broad law enforcement responsibilities. It has enacted legislation authorizing the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies. This legislation contains explicit grants of authority and restrictions on military assistance to police. Section 271 specifically authorizes the armed forces to share information acquired during military operations. The legislation authorizes the armed forces to provide military assistance to civilian authorities, including sharing information and equipment, training civilian police, and maintaining equipment. Military undercover agents and intelligence collection are allowed only for military purposes. The authority granted is subject to general caveats. The legislation authorizes the armed forces to provide military assistance to civilian authorities, including training civilian police and maintaining equipment. The authority granted is subject to general caveats to ensure it does not undermine the military capability of the United States or result in the armed forces being used for civilian law enforcement purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit the Army from performing military duties that incidentally benefit civilian law enforcement. The act only prohibits \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force. The Posse Comitatus Act limits proscription to \"willful and knowing\" violations, with the compromise forbidding only willful violations. The Act prohibits the armed forces from performing tasks assigned to civilian government or solely for civilian government purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the armed forces from performing tasks assigned to civilian government or solely for civilian government purposes. Questions about the Act often arise when the military assists civilian police, with tests developed from incidents at Wounded Knee in 1973 to determine if the military has been improperly used as a police force. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the Army or Air Force for law enforcement purposes, but does not mention the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Guard. However, these forces are subject to similar restrictions through Department of Defense instructions. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Coast Guard, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security but can be relocated to the Navy during war. The Coast Guard is authorized to perform law enforcement functions. The Coast Guard, although part of the Department of Homeland Security, can be moved to the Navy during war. It is authorized to perform law enforcement functions, exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act restrictions that apply to the Army and Air Force. The Act's coverage regarding the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and off-duty military members is unclear. The Posse Comitatus Act applies to the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and off-duty military members, but its coverage is unclear. The National Guard is considered part of the Army or Air Force when in federal service, and historical reflection suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service. The Posse Comitatus Act applies to the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and off-duty military members. The Act's reference to \"posse comitatus or otherwise\" aims to prevent troops from executing laws as citizens rather than soldiers. The National Guard is subject to the Act when in federal service, but not when not in federal service. The DOD Instruction only applies to National Guard members in federal service. Courts have ruled that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to National Guard members when not in federal service. The Act was created in response to military members being used as a posse comitatus, but recent decisions focus on whether assistance provided is primarily for a military purpose. The Posse Comitatus Act was enacted in response to military members being used as a posse comitatus, but recent debates in the Senate suggest that it was not intended to strip service members of all civilian rights and obligations. The Act's restrictions also apply to civilian employees under the direct command of a military officer, but it is unlikely to have extraterritorial application. The Posse Comitatus Act, a criminal statute, was enacted in response to problems within the United States and its territories related to military usurpation of civilian law enforcement responsibilities. It is intended to apply both domestically and internationally, with limited prosecutions but varying success in challenging court jurisdiction and as a defense in criminal cases. The Posse Comitatus Act has been used to challenge court jurisdiction, as a defense in criminal cases, for suppression of evidence, civil liability, and to enjoin military actions. Defendants often invoke the act to exclude evidence, but there is no exclusionary rule. While courts have mentioned the possibility of an exclusionary rule for deterrence, no such case has arisen. Defendants have used the Posse Comitatus Act in prosecutions to challenge the lawfulness of government conduct. While some have successfully argued that evidence of violations prevented their convictions, courts have not dismissed cases based on military involvement violating the act, even when violations occurred. The Eighth Circuit has suggested that a violation of the act could constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. The Posse Comitatus Act violation can be used as a defense in prosecutions, but courts have not dismissed cases based on military involvement violating the act. The Eighth Circuit has suggested that a violation of the act could constitute an unreasonable search and seizure, leading to a Bivens cause of action. However, a violation of the act also provides a defense to a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Plaintiffs asserting violations against state or local law enforcement officers face challenges due to the lack of precedent for such liability. The Posse Comitatus Act impacts compliance by the armed forces, with the military avoiding involvement in civilian affairs to uphold civilian authority. This also applies to injuries caused by federal officers acting beyond their authority, while state or local law enforcement officers face challenges due to lack of liability precedent."
