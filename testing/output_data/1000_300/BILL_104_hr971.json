    "content": "The Act titled \"Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995\" is cited as the short title. The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US in preserving their property value, which is influenced by the quality of the neighborhood and environment. This is crucial for factors like water quality, air clarity, flood risk, and community beauty. The value of homes in the United States can be negatively impacted by various factors such as land development, industrial activities, and other actions on neighboring properties. Protecting homeowners from these adverse effects is crucial. Protecting private homeowners from irresponsible actions that harm property values is crucial for homeowners, communities, and society as a whole. Current public information procedures often fail to notify homeowners of activities that could significantly impact their home values. SEC. 3. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT ACTIVITIES THAT COULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES. Within 90 days of this Act's enactment, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies. These procedures will require any person applying for property impacting activities to provide a notice. The term \"application to conduct property impacting activity\" refers to permits, licenses, approvals, contracts, or leases.

Homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius must receive individual written notice by certified mail. The applicant must provide written notice to homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius of the site where the activity will take place. Notice must also be published in local newspapers at least 3 times. The agency may also notify homeowners likely to be affected by mail. The notice should describe the nature of the activity, potential impacts on property value, and effects on homeowners and the public. The agency requires the applicant to notify homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius of the proposed activity site through written notice and local newspaper publications. Homeowners can call a toll-free number to express concerns about potential property value impacts or request more information. Each agency must establish a toll-free number for homeowners to register concerns about potential property value impacts or request information on property impacting activities. Agencies are required to thoroughly investigate the impact of proposed activities on home values and seek alternatives to minimize adverse effects. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. Whenever a person carries out an activity authorized by a permit or federal law that causes a significant reduction in the value of a private home by $10,000 or more, the homeowner can sue the person responsible. Prior to filing a lawsuit, the homeowner must provide a 30-day notice of intent to sue to the defendant and the relevant agency. At least 30 days before suing for property value reduction of $10,000 or more, a homeowner must send a notice of intent to sue to the defendant and relevant agency. The agency can try to resolve the claim to avoid litigation costs, but the homeowner retains the right to sue after the 30-day notice period. In any action under this section, the homeowner must prove that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. Homeowners can file class action suits under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The remedy allows homeowners to recover the reduction in their home's value caused by the defendant's activity. (e) Remedy - Homeowners authorized to sue under this section can recover an amount equal to the decrease in their home's value caused by the defendant's activity, capped at the median value of nearby homes. (f) Attorney's Fees - Homeowners awarded compensation are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and other costs. (g) Injunction - The court may also enjoin the activity if it violates any Federal laws or regulations. The court may enjoin activities that violate Federal laws or regulations. The United States district court has jurisdiction over actions brought under this section. Frivolous lawsuits may result in the plaintiff paying the defendant's attorney fees and expenses. The court may order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney fees and expenses. No action can be brought after 5 years if the value reduction of a private home reaches $10,000. The Act does not limit any person's rights to pursue claims under the Constitution or other laws. The Act does not limit any person's rights to pursue claims under the Constitution or other laws, and commencement of a suit or receipt of compensation under this Act is not a condition precedent for any other claim or cause of action.
