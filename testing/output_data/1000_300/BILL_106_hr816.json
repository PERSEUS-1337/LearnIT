If the address is known, the notice will include the amount in gross income for the previous taxable year. If the address is unknown, no income will be included for any taxable year before the year preceding when the notice can be sent. Subsequent payments can be deducted in the year they are made. The amendments made by this section allow child support payments to be deducted in the taxable year they are made, with definitions provided for terms such as 'applicable child support payments' and 'eligible taxpayer'. Effective date for these changes is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999. SEC. 4. ALLOWANCE OF BAD DEBT DEDUCTION FOR UNPAID CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. SEC. 4.

The paragraph discusses the income of the eligible taxpayer for the taxable year and the requirements for a support instrument. The text discusses amendments to the tax code regarding unpaid child support payments and applicable child support payments. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999.
