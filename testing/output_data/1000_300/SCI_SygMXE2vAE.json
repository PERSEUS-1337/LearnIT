This study presents a layer-wise analysis of BERT's hidden states to better understand Transformer-based models. Unlike previous research focusing on attention weights, this analysis emphasizes the valuable information contained in hidden states. The study specifically examines models fine-tuned for Question Answering (QA) tasks to understand how they transform token vectors to find the correct answer. By applying general and QA-specific probing tasks, the researchers reveal the information stored in each representation layer. Visualizations of hidden states offer additional insights into the functioning of these models. The study presents a layer-wise analysis of BERT's hidden states, focusing on how QA models transform token vectors to find the correct answer. Results show that BERT's transformations align with traditional pipeline tasks and can incorporate task-specific information. Fine-tuning has minimal impact on semantic abilities, and prediction errors can be detected in early layers. Transformer models have gained popularity in Natural Language Processing, surpassing RNNs in Machine Translation. Transformer models, particularly BERT, have gained popularity in Natural Language Processing for their improvements over RNNs in Machine Translation. With the advent of large models and extensive pre-training, they have become prevalent in the field. The paper discusses BERT BID8, a popular Transformer model that has shown significant improvements in various Natural Language Processing tasks. It addresses the issue of black box models and highlights the success of deep learning models in different domains. The paper discusses the challenges of black box models and the lack of transparency in deep learning models, particularly Transformer Networks. It proposes a new approach to interpreting Transformer Networks by examining hidden states between encoder layers. This approach aims to address questions about how Transformers decompose answers. The paper addresses questions about Transformer Networks by examining hidden states between encoder layers. It discusses if Transformers answer questions decompositionally like humans, if specific layers in a multi-layer network solve different tasks, the influence of fine-tuning on a network's inner state, and how evaluating network layers can help understand why a network failed to predict a correct answer. The analysis is based on fine-tuned models on standard QA datasets, using Question Answering as an example of a complex downstream task that requires solving various Natural Language Processing tasks. The paper explores Transformer Networks by analyzing hidden states between encoder layers. It proposes layer-wise visualization of token representations to expose wrong predictions and analyze BERT's abilities through general NLP Probing Tasks and QA-specific tasks. Preliminary tests on the small GPT-2 model show similar results to BERT. The paper analyzes Transformer Networks by examining hidden states between encoder layers and proposes layer-wise visualization of token representations to expose incorrect predictions. It also explores BERT's abilities through general NLP Probing Tasks and QA-specific tasks, showing that BERT's transformations go through similar phases even when fine-tuned on different tasks. The analysis focuses on BERT and partially includes the GPT-2 model, highlighting how information about language properties is encoded in earlier layers and used to solve downstream tasks in later layers. The paper discusses Transformer Networks and BERT's abilities in NLP tasks, highlighting how information is encoded in earlier layers and used in later layers. It also mentions the Transformer models GPT-2, Universal Transformer, and TransformerXL as potential areas for future analysis in neural model interpretability and probing. Interpretability and probing of neural models, particularly focusing on post-hoc probing tasks applied to trained models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1. Recent advances include a novel \"edge-probing\" framework by Tenney et al. that examines semantic and syntactic information in pre-trained models. The text discusses various probing tasks applied to pre-trained models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1 to analyze semantic and syntactic information. Different studies focus on specific aspects such as attention values in BERT, qualitative visual analysis in CNNs, phoneme recognition in DNNs, and single node activations in speech recognition. In the context of probing tasks on pre-trained models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT-1, various studies delve into specific aspects such as attention values in BERT, qualitative visual analysis in CNNs, phoneme recognition in DNNs, and word vectors' importance in sequence tagging and classification tasks. Liu et al. BID20 previously conducted a layer-wise analysis of BERT's token representations, focusing on general transferability and disregarding fine-tuned models on downstream tasks. In contrast, our work goes beyond by training diagnostic classifiers to support hypotheses and analyzing specific phases that BERT undergoes. Our work focuses on evaluating hidden states and token representations in fine-tuned BERT models. We analyze transforming token vectors qualitatively by examining their positions in vector space and probe their transformations applied to input tokens. The analysis focuses on fine-tuned BERT models, examining token transformations qualitatively by analyzing their positions in vector space and quantitatively through language tasks. The architecture allows tracking token changes throughout the network, with a qualitative approach involving selecting samples from test sets to collect hidden states from each layer. The analysis involves examining token transformations in fine-tuned BERT models by collecting hidden states from each layer of correctly and falsely predicted samples. The model can freely transform the vector space, and distances between token vectors indicate semantic relations. Dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE, PCA, and ICA are applied to visualize token relations in two-dimensional space. After collecting hidden states from each layer of BERT models, dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE, PCA, and ICA are applied to visualize token relations in two-dimensional space. K-means clustering is used to verify the distribution of clusters in high-dimensional vector space. Semantic probing tasks are then conducted to analyze information stored within the transformed tokens after each layer. After visualizing token relations in 2D space and verifying cluster distribution, semantic probing tasks are conducted to analyze information stored within transformed tokens after each layer in BERT models. The tasks include Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, and Question Type Classification. The tasks of Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification are adopted for language understanding and reasoning. Named Entity Labeling involves predicting entity categories from token spans, Coreference Resolution predicts if two mentions refer to the same entity, and Relation Classification categorizes relationships between entities. The Coreference task involves predicting if two mentions refer to the same entity, while Relation Classification predicts the relationship between known entities. Question Type Classification aims to identify the question type accurately using a dataset with 500 fine-grained question types. Source code for all experiments will be made publicly available. The Edge Probing task uses the Question Classification dataset with 500 question types. It focuses on extracting Supporting Facts for Question Answering tasks using BERT's token transformations to distinguish important context parts. The model predicts if a sentence contains supporting facts for a specific question. The Edge Probing task involves constructing a probing task to identify Supporting Facts using BERT's token representations. Different datasets have specific tasks to recognize relevant parts, with samples labeled as supporting facts or not. Input tokens are embedded with a fine-tuned BERT model for each probing task sample. The Edge Probing task involves using BERT models to identify relevant parts in samples labeled as supporting facts or not. Input tokens are embedded with a fine-tuned BERT model for each sample, and only tokens of \"labeled edges\" are considered for classification. These tokens are then fed into a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier to predict label-wise probability scores. The curr_chunk discusses using a two-layer Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier to predict label-wise probability scores for different types of relations. The study aims to understand how BERT works on complex downstream tasks like Question Answering (QA) by analyzing datasets such as SQUAD, bAbI, and HotpotQA. The datasets were intentionally chosen to diversify the results of the analysis. The study analyzes datasets like SQUAD, bAbI, and HotpotQA to understand how BERT works on complex downstream tasks like Question Answering. HotpotQA contains 112,000 natural question-answer pairs designed to combine information from multiple parts of a context. The focus is on the distractor-task of HotpotQA. The HotpotQA task involves 112,000 question-answer pairs that require combining information from various parts of a context. To accommodate the input size restriction of the pre-trained BERT model, the distracting facts are reduced by a factor of 2.7. The bAbI tasks are artificial toy tasks designed to test neural models' abilities in reasoning over multiple sentences, including Positional Reasoning, Argument Relation Extraction, and Coreference Resolution. The 20 toy tasks involve Multihop QA and require reasoning over multiple sentences. They focus on Positional Reasoning, Argument Relation Extraction, and Coreference Resolution. The tasks are simple with a vocabulary size of 230 and short contexts. The analysis is based on BERT and GPT-2 models, both Transformers that build on previous ideas. GPT-2 is a decoder model, while BERT uses an encoder-decoder architecture. The text discusses the use of BERT and GPT-2 models in a probing setup for experiments. The models are fine-tuned on datasets with hyperparameters tuned through grid search. Training involves adjusting learning rate, batch size, and scheduling for 5 epochs with evaluations every 1000 iterations. The input length chosen is 384 tokens for the bAbI and SQuAD tasks, and the maximum of 512 tokens permitted by the pre-trained models' positional embedding for the HotpotQA tasks. For BAbI, models are evaluated on single tasks and a multitask model trained on data from all 20 tasks. Two settings are distinguished: Span prediction and Sequence Classification. Span prediction is included for better comparison with other datasets, while Sequence Classification is the more common approach to bAbI. The study evaluated models on tasks with different input lengths. For HotpotQA, two tasks were distinguished: Support Only (SP) and Distractor. The evaluation results of the best models are shown in TAB3, with accuracy on the SQuAD task close to human performance. The HotpotQA Distractor task includes distracting sentences within the context, staying within the 512 token limit. Evaluation results show that models perform close to human accuracy on the SQuAD task. Tasks derived from HotpotQA are more challenging, with the distractor setting being the most difficult. BERT and GPT-2 easily solve bAbI tasks, but GPT-2 performs better on bAbI while BERT struggles with tasks requiring positional or geometric reasoning. BERT struggles with tasks 17 and 19 in the bAbI dataset, which require positional or geometric reasoning. GPT-2 outperforms BERT on these tasks, showcasing improved reasoning capabilities. Analysis results show recurring patterns in vector transformations, with comparisons between models displayed in figures. Results from probing tasks are displayed in FIG1, comparing macro-averaged F1 over all network layers for different BERT models. The PCA representations of tokens in various layers indicate multiple phases in answering questions across different QA tasks. The four phases identified include Semantic Clustering, where early layers group tokens into topical clusters. In the middle layers of BERT-based models, entities are connected by their relation within a certain input context, forming task-specific clusters. These clusters include question-relevant entities and show a filtering process. In BERT-based models, task-specific clusters of entities are formed based on their relation within a certain input context. These clusters include question-relevant entities and help in filtering out irrelevant information. The clusters aid in solving specific questions by highlighting relevant entities and their relationships. The BERT-based models form task-specific clusters of entities based on their relations within the input context. These clusters highlight relevant entities and their relationships, aiding in solving specific questions. The model's ability to recognize entities, identify mentions, and find relations improves until higher network layers, as shown in the probing results. Named Entity Labeling is learned first, while recognizing coreferences or relations requires input from additional layers until the model's performance peaks. These patterns are observed in both BERT-base and BERT-large models. The BERT models transform tokens to match question tokens with relevant context tokens, showing stronger ability in higher layers to distinguish relevant information. The BERT models show stronger ability in higher layers to distinguish relevant information, as demonstrated by the performance increase over successive layers for SQuAD and bAbI tasks. However, the fine-tuned HotpotQA model does not reach high accuracy, indicating its inability to identify correct Supporting Facts. Vector representations help in retracing decisions and making the model more transparent. The model dissolves previous clusters in the last network layers, separating correct answer tokens from the rest. The vector representation becomes task-specific during fine-tuning, leading to a performance drop in general NLP tasks. Fine-tuned BERT models lose the ability to perform well on certain tasks like NEL or COREF. The large BERT model fine-tuned on HotpotQA loses information in last-layer representations, affecting its performance on tasks like NEL or COREF. The model's phases of answering questions can be compared to human reasoning, but with differences such as BERT's ability to see all parts of the input at once. BERT's ability to see all parts of the input at once allows it to run multiple processes concurrently during the answering process. A major difference between GPT-2 and BERT is that GPT-2 pays particular attention to the first token of a sequence, resulting in a separation of two clusters during dimensionality reduction. GPT-2 focuses on the first token of a sequence, leading to a separation of clusters during dimensionality reduction. This issue affects all layers except for the Embedding Layer, the first Transformer block, and the last one. To address this, the first token is masked during dimensionality reduction. GPT-2, like BERT, separates relevant information in the vector space but also extracts additional sentences with similar meaning. Unlike BERT, GPT-2 does not distinctly separate the correct answer within the sentence. Our analysis of GPT-2 reveals that it extracts sentences with similar meaning, similar to BERT. Unlike BERT, GPT-2 does not clearly separate the correct answer within the sentence. This suggests that our findings extend beyond BERT to other Transformer networks. Future work will involve more probing tasks to confirm these observations. Visualizations of failure states in explainable Neural Networks show when, why, and how the network fails, with hidden state representations indicating task difficulty. The difficulty of a task can be determined by examining hidden state representations. For incorrect predictions, there are two possibilities: if the network is confident in a wrong answer, early layers can reveal why the wrong candidate was chosen. If network confidence is low, transformations do not follow the usual phases. The wrong Supporting Fact was matched with the question in early layers due to low network confidence. Transformations do not go through the usual phases, resulting in little impact from fine-tuning on the model's core NLP abilities. Fine-tuning has little impact on the core NLP abilities of the pretrained model, as it only applies small weight changes. The model retains previously learned encoding when fitting specific tasks like QA, indicating the success of Transfer Learning. Positional embedding is crucial for Transformer network performance, maintaining its effects throughout the layers. The positional embedding in Transformer networks addresses the lack of sequential information compared to RNNs. Visualizations show its impact even in late layers. Fine-tuning on SQuAD improves question type resolution, while bAbI tasks show a decrease in this ability due to their static structure. The model fine-tuned on SQuAD shows improved ability in question type resolution, while the model fine-tuned on bAbI tasks loses this ability. Fine-tuning on HotpotQA does not result in performance improvement. The study provides insights into Transformer networks and their inner workings. The impact of findings on Transformer networks at CIKM '19, Beijing, China includes interpretability of token vectors revealing useful information for identifying misclassified examples and model weaknesses. Lower layers may be more suitable for certain problems in Transfer Learning tasks, suggesting individual layer depth selection based on the task. Further research is needed for processing this information effectively. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of layer depth selection in Transfer Learning tasks and the potential benefits of exploiting modularity in Transformer networks. It suggests further research on skip connections and the internal processes within Transformer-based models. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need to understand state-of-the-art models and their approach to solving tasks for improvement. It suggests focusing on specific tasks in pre-training rather than using end-to-end language models."
