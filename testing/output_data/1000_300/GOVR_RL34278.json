    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. The Administration's initial request for emergency funding was made in February 2007, with an additional request for $5.3 billion for MRAP. In FY2008, the Administration requested emergency supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Additional requests were made for MRAP vehicles and emergency defense and international affairs funding. Congress approved the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act in November, which funded both day-to-day peacetime activities and war-related operations for the Army and Marine Corps. The regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, funded day-to-day peacetime activities and war-related operations for the Army and Marine Corps. Due to the high pace of operations in Iraq, the base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance was quickly depleted. Without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. Options to extend operations included transferring funds from other accounts, slowing peacetime operations, or invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act.\" The Defense Department faced funding challenges for military operations in FY2008, with options including transferring funds from other accounts, invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act,\" or seeking congressional approval for a $70 billion \"bridge fund.\" The approved bill provided partial funding for Army and Marine Corps operations and maintenance, estimated to last until June. The FY2008 appropriations act, P.L. 110-161, along with the regular defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, will provide funding for Army military personnel and operation and maintenance until June or early July. The Defense Department has options to extend operations further, including transferring funds from other accounts, invoking the Feed and Forage Act, or requesting emergency supplemental funding. The Administration submitted requests for $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department. The Administration submitted requests for FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $141.7 billion for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act, including estimated full-year costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at a similar pace to 2006. The White House requested an additional $5.3 billion for the Department of Defense to procure Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles and later requested an additional $45.9 billion for military operations and reconstruction assistance in FY2008. The White House requested an additional $45.9 billion for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security in FY2008, with $42.3 billion allocated for the Department of Defense. This was part of a larger request for $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for ongoing conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas. In early 2007, congressional debate focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with a revised request submitted in March. The President vetoed an initial bill in May due to Iraq policy provisions, but a compromise bill was approved providing funding for defense, international affairs, and domestic programs. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill included funding for defense, foreign affairs, and domestic programs. Congress also approved a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for defense. Emergency supplemental funding for FY2008 began in September and was finalized just before Christmas. Congress quickly allocated funds for MRAP vehicles and debated measures for overseas operations. $5.2 billion was included for MRAP vehicles in the first FY2008 continuing resolution. In September, Congress allocated $5.2 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in the FY2008 continuing resolution. Additional funding for MRAP vehicles was approved in the FY2008 defense appropriations bill, totaling $11.6 billion. The bill also provided $460 billion for Defense Department activities in FY2008, with specific allocations for Army and Marine Corps operations and maintenance. The House approved a bill providing $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and a plan to withdraw most troops by December 15, 2008. The bill approved by the House in November 2007 required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and a plan to withdraw most troops by December 15, 2008. The Senate refused to close debate on the bill, effectively killing the measure. The Senate rejected a motion to consider a substitute bill providing $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of limited operations without additional funding, including furloughs of government employees and contractors. The Army faced funding shortages, risking operations at bases by mid-February 2008. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to extend operations until February 23. Congress needed to approve additional funding to avoid halting essential operations. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for various programs, and $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations for Operation Enduring Freedom. The House approved $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations for Operation Enduring Freedom, with restrictions on where the funds could be used. The Senate later adopted an amendment to provide $70 billion for the Department of Defense without limits on usage or requiring a withdrawal from Iraq. The House approved $70 billion for the Department of Defense for overseas operations without restrictions on usage or requiring a withdrawal from Iraq. The President signed the consolidated appropriations bill into law on December 26, 2007, resolving a dispute over war funding that had threatened Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. The Defense Department warned of funding shortages for Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008, with a potential shutdown of Army bases by mid-February. However, the $70 billion in consolidated appropriations averted this crisis, providing $35.2 billion for the Army and $4.0 billion for the Marine Corps, in addition to regular FY2008 appropriations. The Defense Department received $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations and maintenance accounts in addition to previous appropriations. This funding is expected to sustain Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August 2008. The Army may exhaust its military personnel account by mid-June, prompting the need for transfers of funds or other measures to extend operations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for transfers between accounts to extend Army and Marine Corps operations. This includes $3.7 billion in general transfer authority, $3.7 billion for the Iraqi Freedom Fund, and $4.0 billion in emergency appropriations. Transfers could potentially extend Army operations for another month without slowing down. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for transfers to extend Army and Marine Corps operations, with additional funds possibly available in cash balances of DOD working capital funds. Transfers could potentially extend Army operations for another month without slowing down, but this would reduce financial flexibility for other needs. Congress's agreement to provide a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate, but the underlying controversy remains regarding the Defense Department's flexibility in delaying or avoiding shutdowns without full-year defense appropriations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for transfers to extend Army and Marine Corps operations, with additional funds possibly available in cash balances of DOD working capital funds. In FY2008, CRS calculated that funds would be exhausted by February for the Army and by early April for the Marine Corps. DOD's proposed transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army would have extended its operations for another two to three weeks. Without supplemental appropriations, the Defense Department could have extended operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps and by slowing down spending. The Defense Department had $11.4 billion available for transfers to extend Army and Marine Corps operations. Without supplemental appropriations, operations could have been extended for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts and slowing down spending. Alternative measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or assigning Navy and Air Force to pay for Army support operations abroad could have sustained operations longer, but each had limitations and disadvantages. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, could impact DOD's financial flexibility and disrupt day-to-day operations. Concerns arise from using the Feed and Forage Act to finance military operations and Navy/Air Force funds for Army support. Balancing potential disruptions from these measures against the need for personnel furloughs is crucial. The consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161, includes regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds totaling $1,473.8 million. This amount includes $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. The remaining $5.4 billion of the Administration's emergency request is yet to be considered. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts in the act include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping for activities in Darfur. The appropriations act includes $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping in Darfur, $12.0 million for International Broadcasting, $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses in Iraq, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance. The House bill includes funding for various programs such as Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. The bill also outlines defense supplemental appropriations and Operation Enduring Freedom funding. The House bill includes funding for various programs such as Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. It also includes the Administration request for a bridge fund, the House-passed bridge fund, Operation Enduring Freedom supplemental, and the final $70 billion bridge fund approved by the Senate and House. The original House-passed bridge fund required a plan to withdraw most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008, while the final emergency funding legislation includes reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. The original House-passed bill included a $50 billion bridge fund with a requirement for troop withdrawal from Iraq within 30 days and a target date of December 15, 2008 for completion. It allowed for a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups. H.R. 4156 stated Congress's desire for a quick end to the war in Iraq and extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies. H.R. 4156 extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies and required the President to begin an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days. It set a goal of completing the transition to a limited presence by December 15, 2008. The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq should be accompanied by a comprehensive strategy to bring stability, with a goal of completing the transition by December 15, 2008. Restricted missions after the transition include protecting U.S. facilities, training Iraqi security forces, and engaging in targeted counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports on the transition plans are required, and congressional consideration of additional funding is contingent on the first report. A comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East is required by February 15, 2008. The U.S. mission in Iraq should transition to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. Quarterly reports on military and political stability in Iraq are required, with performance measures and a timetable for goals. Senators proposed an amendment for the transition, emphasizing the shift in mission. The Senate failed to approve an amendment expressing the sense of Congress that the U.S. mission in Iraq should shift to training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The vote was 50-45, with 60 votes required, and the amendment was subsequently withdrawn. The Senate failed to approve an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding for operations after nine months. The vote was 24-71, with 60 votes required, and the amendment was then withdrawn. The Senate refused to approve a measure to withdraw troops from Iraq and cut off funding for operations. Instead, a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" was approved for FY2008 without language requiring troop withdrawal. The Secretary of Defense was required to provide regular reports on progress in Iraq, including criteria for safe troop withdrawal. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional military appropriations. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional military appropriations for FY2008, including funds for military operations abroad, international affairs programs, and other agencies. The request also included $5.3 billion for mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle procurement and deployment. The White House requested $196.5 billion in additional military appropriations for FY2008, including funds for military operations abroad, international affairs programs, and other agencies. This included $5.3 billion for mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle procurement and deployment. Additionally, the Administration requested a total of $189.3 billion for military operations in FY2008, $6.9 billion in supplemental funding for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. Table 3 summarizes supplemental funding requests made by the Administration in February, July, and October for FY2008. The requests were designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps set by the congressional budget resolution. While these emergency funds are exempt from spending limits, not all the money provided by Congress may be considered emergency appropriations, especially for ongoing war-related expenses. The Senate has spending limits, but the terms \"emergency\" may not apply to all money provided by Congress, especially for ongoing war-related expenses. S.Con.Res. 21 exempts emergency amounts from spending caps but includes a restrictive definition of emergency spending. The budget resolution allows for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities, which may be used instead of \"emergency\" appropriations to avoid exceeding budget limits in the Senate. Supplemental appropriations bills often provide more money than requested by the White House. Supplemental appropriations bills, including the FY2007 supplemental H.R. 2206, P.L. 110-28, often exceed White House requests and can include funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, and health insurance. These bills may also incorporate significant legislative initiatives, such as increasing the minimum wage. The appropriations committee was expected to include additional emergency funds for Hurricane Katrina recovery and other purposes in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill for the war, but due to potential delays, appropriators decided not to wait to address these issues. The FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill for the war was delayed, prompting appropriators to address hurricane recovery and other issues in the second FY2008 continuing resolution. This resolution, attached to the FY2008 defense appropriations bill, included funding for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. The FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill included additional funds for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. Congress provided $16.8 billion for MRAPs in previous resolutions and bills. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill allocated $5.2 billion for MRAP production and deployment, with an additional $11.6 billion designated as emergency appropriations. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116, signed into law, includes $11.6 billion for MRAPs as emergency appropriations. The omnibus appropriations bill signed on December 26 includes $70 billion, with $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, $11 billion for Navy, Air Force, and other components, and funds for Afghan and Iraqi security forces. It also includes $4.3 billion for joint IED defense and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116, includes $11.6 billion for MRAPs as emergency appropriations. The bill also includes $4.3 billion for joint IED defense and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement. Additionally, it permits up to $4 billion to be transferred between accounts in the bridge fund, providing flexibility for future Defense Department operations. The $189.3 billion requested for military operations in FY2008 continues the trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for the Defense Department. The funding for war-related expenses has significantly increased since FY2003, reaching $171.3 billion in FY2007. The rise in funding is not solely due to military operations but also includes investments in repairing and upgrading equipment. Weapons procurement saw the largest increase, growing from $19 billion in FY2005 to a requested $64 billion in FY2008. The funding for war-related expenses has significantly increased since FY2003, reaching $171.3 billion in FY2007. The largest increases in funding have been for weapons procurement, which has grown from about $19 billion in FY2005 to a requested $64 billion in the amended FY2008 request. Operation and maintenance funding has also increased, much of that to repair equipment. Additionally, there have been increases in funding to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi military forces, as well as to reorganize the Army into a modular, brigade-centered force. The Defense Department's funding trend shows increases in force protection and support to foreign security forces. Significant funding has been allocated for \"reconstitution,\" which involves repairing and replacing equipment lost in combat. Secretary Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" for this process. Congress insisted on adding funds for new equipment to restore the force to its pre-war condition. The Defense Department's funding trend includes increases in force protection and support for foreign security forces. \"Reconstitution\" involves repairing and replacing combat-lost equipment, with Secretary Rumsfeld preferring the term \"reset.\" The concept now encompasses more than just restoring the force, aiming to refine and potentially reduce funding requirements. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass substantial upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping Guard and reserve units for overseas operations. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass substantial upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls and fully equipping Guard and reserve units for overseas operations. Congress generally supports upgrading ground forces and questions only a small share of requested increases in equipment funding. For example, there were questions about Air Force requests for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and Navy requests for V-22 tilt rotor aircraft, which were later withdrawn by the Administration. The Administration withdrew requests for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and V-22 tilt rotor aircraft to realign funding for the troop surge. The amended defense request prioritized funding for MRAPs and included $6.3 billion for maintaining additional Army and Marine units in Iraq. The budget includes funding for additional Army and Marine units in Iraq until December 2007, with plans to return to pre-surge levels by July. Other increases include money for Iraqi security forces, reopening factories in Iraq, and construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there is funding for equipment repair and replacement. The October budget amendment includes $8.8 billion for repairing, replacing, and replenishing equipment and supplies, with $1 billion allocated for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment. Another $5.4 billion is designated to restock equipment inventories of combat support and combat service support units. Defense Department officials acknowledge this is only part of the amount needed to address equipment shortages due to cross-leveling. The budget amendment includes $2.5 billion for various initiatives, such as fuel price increases, accelerating construction of facilities, improving Army medical facilities, and supporting soldier and family programs. Additionally, $35.1 billion was allocated for international affairs in the FY2008 budget. The Administration's FY2008 budget included $35.1 billion for international affairs, with an additional emergency supplemental request of $6.897 billion. This funding covers State Department operations, foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimated emergency supplemental funding needs of $3.220 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs. The State Department's FY2008 budget included $35.1 billion for international affairs, with an additional emergency supplemental request of $6.897 billion. This funding covers operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimated emergency supplemental funding needs of $3.220 billion for various programs, including Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush Administration has increasingly requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. The Bush Administration has requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, including $350 million for P.L. 480 food assistance. Nearly half of the total foreign operations package was allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some critics argue that items related to Iraq and Afghanistan have become routine and should be included in regular appropriations. The Administration defends the need for emergency supplemental requests due to rapidly changing overseas events and unforeseen emergencies. In February 2007, the original FY2008 State Department portion of the emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq. The Bush Administration requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, including $350 million for P.L. 480 food assistance. The original FY2008 State Department portion of the emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq. An additional $1.3 billion was later added for various programs, bringing the total emergency funds requested for FY2008 to $3.220 billion. The Mission in Iraq consists of about 1,000 direct-hire Americans representing 12 U.S. government agencies. The Bush Administration requested $3.220 billion in emergency funds for the Administration of Foreign Affairs, with $2.120.6 billion designated for Iraq operations. This includes $978.7 million for security needs such as guards, armored vehicles, and equipment. The Bush Administration requested $3.220 billion in emergency funds for the Administration of Foreign Affairs, with $2.120.6 billion designated for Iraq operations. This includes funding for personal security details, armored vehicles, physical and technical security, equipment, support for special agents, counterterrorism training, Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), salaries, operations, living accommodations, medical support, information technology, security, leases of space in Baghdad, and worldwide security upgrades in Afghanistan. The Administration requested $516.8 million for leases of space in Baghdad and $162.4 million for security upgrades in Afghanistan, including securing facilities, high threat protection teams, and fully armored vehicles. Other expenses covered U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Maintenance account, $53 million for U.S. assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and $723.6 million for U.S. Contributions for International Peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided regular and supplemental funding for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors in Division J of the Consolidated Appropriation Act (P.L. 110-161), totaling $1.262 billion in supplemental funds for the Department of State\u2014$781.6 million for State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) and $468.0 million for U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping (CIPA). The emergency supplemental amounts are less than the Administration's request, with $575.0 million specified for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection (WSP) within the D&CP account. The $781.6 million for D&CP includes $575.0 million for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection. $206 million was applied to the FY2008 base request, leaving $162.4 million pending for WSP in Afghanistan. The appropriation does not specify CIPA emergency supplemental funds allocation but mentions $550.4 million for a new UN/AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur. $390 million is allocated for Darfur and $78 million for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds. $333.6 million is still pending for Darfur. Emergency supplemental funds for the BBG total $12.0 million. $390 million allocated for Darfur, $78 million for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds. Pending $333.6 million for Darfur. Emergency supplemental funds for BBG total $12.0 million. No specific allocation requirements mentioned. Foreign Operations portion of supplemental request sent to Congress in two tranches totaling $3.678 billion. $1.367 billion request with President's budget, amended request for $2.311 billion sent on October 22nd. Includes $2.217 billion in Economic Support Funds for Iraq, Afghanistan, West. An amended budget request for $2.311 billion, including P.L. 480 food aid, was sent to Congress on October 22nd. The request included $2.217 billion in Economic Support Funds for various countries, with the largest portions allocated for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Mexico. Additional funding was allocated for anti-narcotics efforts, migration and refugee assistance, and international disaster and famine assistance. The International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) request of $80 million would aid internally displaced persons in Iraq. Additionally, $5 million is requested for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service. A $350 million request for P.L. 480 food aid would support programs in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, Sudan, and a $30 million contingency fund for future needs. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations, but the exact allocation is unclear. The White House requested $2.2 billion in ESF funds for six recipients, but the legislation is not explicit on where the funds should be directed. Congress approved supplemental funds including $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, and $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. The White House requested $2.2 billion in ESF funds for various countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress approved supplemental funds for Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. No funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs in Mexico and Central America. Over $42 billion had been appropriated for Iraq reconstruction prior to the omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill. In FY2008, $42 billion in U.S. funds were allocated for Iraq reconstruction, mostly through emergency supplemental measures. The Administration requested $392 million for security assistance, but Congress rejected it in favor of relying on emergency funding. The revised emergency supplemental appropriations request included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with security aid funded by Department of Defense appropriations. The FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations request included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for Department of Defense reconstruction appropriations. This funding would primarily support training Iraqi troops and provide reconstruction grants through the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). CERP allows military commanders to fund various local economic activities like renovating health clinics and digging wells. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) provides small grants for local economic activities like renovating health clinics and digging wells. It also funds infrastructure efforts such as electric generators and sewer systems. Recently, CERP has paid salaries to the Sons of Iraq to improve security. Additionally, a $100 million request was added to the Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq, aiming to stimulate the economy and create employment for Iraqi citizens. The Task Force funded at $50 million under previous legislation aims to stimulate the Iraqi economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. Challenges include lack of electricity, security issues, and low interest from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would allocate $1.2 billion to Iraq for various purposes. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would allocate $1.2 billion to Iraq for various purposes, including funding for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and embedded PRTs to support stabilization efforts in Baghdad and Anbar province. ESF is the primary source of funding for these projects. The ePRTs aim to stabilize areas secured by U.S. and Iraqi forces through small-scale economic projects, job training, and capacity-building for local government officials. ESF funding supports these initiatives, as well as national efforts in Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization. An additional $25 million was added to the ESF supplemental request in October, with a proposal to establish a new Iraq enterprise fund modeled after those in east Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Administration plans to establish a new Iraq enterprise fund based on the model created for east Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, encouraging growth of the private sector. The success of these funds varies, with some making profitable investments while others struggle due to poor business climate or competition from other funding sources. Some question the overall usefulness of these funds. Some funds have been less successful due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Observers question the funds' usefulness as their development purpose conflicts with economic profit pressures. The INCLE account would support rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region caused by sectarian violence and instability. The IDA program would provide medical care, food, shelter, and other assistance. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region caused by sectarian violence and instability, with an estimated 2.0 million Iraqis fleeing the country and 2.2 million displaced. The IDA program would provide medical care, food, shelter, and relief to refugees and displaced people. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid out of the Administration's $3.7 billion Defense appropriations supplemental request for Iraq. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid in response to the Administration's $3.7 billion Defense appropriations supplemental request for Iraq. However, Congress rejected most regular or supplemental economic assistance to Iraq, only allocating about $250 million for humanitarian programs. This included funding for humanitarian demining, assistance for refugees and internally displaced persons, disaster relief, the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund, and rescue efforts. Congress appropriated $16 million for refugees and internally displaced persons, $5 million for the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund, and $10 million for the rescue of Iraqi scholars. This brings Iraq reconstruction funding since 2003 to $44.8 billion. U.S. funding for PRT operations and programs will rely on available FY2007 funds until the 2nd tranche of the supplemental is considered. The U.S. is relying on available FY2007 funds for PRT operations and programs, as well as other programs to support the surge in Iraq. The Administration is seeking $1 billion in Foreign Operations appropriations and $2 billion in Defense appropriations for emergency Iraq reconstruction aid. Afghanistan completed its political transition in 2005, but faced escalating insurgent threats in 2006. Successful elections were held in Afghanistan in 2004 and 2005, leading to the establishment of a parliament. The success of U.S. stabilization efforts in Afghanistan includes the adoption of a new constitution, successful elections, and increased personal freedoms for Afghan citizens. Women are now participating in economic and political life. The insurgency led by remnants of the Taliban escalated in 2006, but recent counter-insurgency operations have seen some success. The next elections are planned for 2009. The insurgency in Afghanistan, led by remnants of the former Taliban regime, escalated in 2006 despite previous defeats. U.S. and NATO military commanders have had recent successes in counter-insurgency operations, but the Taliban remains a significant threat to peace and security. Slow reconstruction, corruption, and the failure to extend Afghan government authority into rural areas have contributed to the Taliban resurgence. Political leaders in the stable northern part of the country have concerns about reconstruction funding distribution. Narcotics trafficking and independent militias continue to pose challenges. The Afghan government and U.S. officials are facing challenges with narcotics trafficking, independent militias, and Taliban commanders operating from Pakistan. Efforts like the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped regions. Weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to achieving a democratic Afghanistan despite international stabilization measures. The international community has been running PRTs to secure reconstruction in Afghanistan, but weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to democratic progress. The Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction in FY2008, with additional funding for embassy operations and security. The total request was later amended to $839 million to continue stabilization and economic reconstruction efforts. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act funded most government operations, including $1.753 million for military operations in Afghanistan. However, the $839 million request for reconstruction was not appropriated. Key elements of the emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, democratic governance, and reconstruction efforts to support security and development strategy. The amended supplemental request included $275 million for strengthening provincial governance, $50 million for basic social services, and $170 million for economic growth and infrastructure in Afghanistan. Key programs funded include the National Solidarity Program, Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund, and Provincial Governance Fund.
