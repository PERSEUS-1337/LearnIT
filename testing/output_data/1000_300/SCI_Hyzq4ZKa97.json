    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. NetScore aims to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. This metric is part of a comparative analysis that includes the top-1 accuracy metric and the information density metric. The study introduces the NetScore metric to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage, focusing on accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. It compares this metric with top-1 accuracy and information density across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset, providing a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The practical industrial deployment bottlenecks associated with complex deep neural networks have become increasingly visible. Designing networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a key research focus. Assessing network architecture balance is a challenge, with information density as a widely cited metric. However, it does not consider computational requirements for network inference. NetScore is a new metric introduced in this study to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network efficiency. It aims to address the limitations of existing metrics like information density, which do not consider computational requirements for network inference. The goal is to improve network model search and design by accounting for accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity. The study introduces NetScore, a new metric to evaluate the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network efficiency. The results serve as a reference guide for practitioners, with deep convolutional neural networks like AlexNet BID22 being evaluated.\u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5 are set, and network low accuracy remains a challenge in practical scenarios."
