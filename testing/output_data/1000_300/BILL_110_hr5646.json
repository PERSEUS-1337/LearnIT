    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States with laws expanding firearm rights for self-defense have seen a decrease in firearm-related crime. Currently, Federal regulations restrict firearm possession in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, hindering individuals from exercising their Second Amendment rights. Federal law should clarify that regulations in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges often hinder individuals from exercising their Second Amendment rights, as laws regarding firearms in these areas differ from state laws, trapping law-abiding gun owners. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of individuals in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict individuals from possessing firearms or ammunition in these areas. Federal law should clarify that individuals have second amendment rights in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, ensuring they can possess firearms and ammunition in these areas without restriction. The purpose of this section is to require hunting activities as a land use in all Federal land management plans unless clearly incompatible. The head of the agency must ensure hunting is allowed unless incompatible with the land's purposes, and reasons for not allowing hunting must be published in the management plan. The management plan for Federal land must include reasons for not allowing or restricting hunting activities. Fees charged for hunting activities on Federal land must be used to offset costs directly related to management. The management plan for Federal land must include reasons for not allowing or restricting hunting activities. Fees charged for hunting activities on Federal land shall be retained by the agency to offset costs directly related to hunting management. Definitions in the Act include hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing. The management plan for Federal land must include reasons for not allowing or restricting hunting activities. This section applies to all management plans developed, approved, or amended after the enactment date."
