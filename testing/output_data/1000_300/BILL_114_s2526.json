    "content": "The Act titled \"Made in America Manufacturing Communities Act of 2016\" establishes a program to designate and support manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to support designated manufacturing communities by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to consortium members consistent with the economic development strategy. The program supports designated manufacturing communities by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to consortium members who meet all requirements. Participating agencies include the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development. The program supports designated manufacturing communities by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to consortium members who meet all requirements. Participating agencies include the Department of Defense, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation, Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration. Each participating agency shall identify their programs. The Small Business Administration, as a participating agency, identifies applicable programs for the established program. Multiple consortium members can apply for the same assistance through participating agencies. The Small Business Administration, as a participating agency, can determine preference for financial or technical assistance among consortium members applying for the same aid. The head of a participating agency can give preference to multiple consortium members for financial or technical assistance, requiring coordination among them. A report must be submitted to the Secretary within 90 days outlining how this preference will be implemented. The head of each participating agency must submit a report to the Secretary within 90 days detailing how preferential consideration will be given to consortium members for financial or technical assistance. The Secretary can provide technical assistance to designated manufacturing communities, and participating agencies may award financial or technical assistance to consortium members under the program. Under the program, the head of a participating agency can award financial or technical assistance to a consortium member designated as a manufacturing community to support investments in improving US manufacturing competitiveness. Financial or technical assistance can be used to support investments in infrastructure, access to capital, promotion of exports, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, and process efficiency to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for infrastructure investments, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, and process efficiency to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. Inter-agency coordination is also required among participating agencies. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for infrastructure investments, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, and process efficiency to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. Inter-agency coordination is required to leverage complementary activities and avoid duplication of efforts in designating manufacturing communities through a competitive process. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. An eligible consortium includes higher education, private sector, and government entities. It may also involve additional private sector partners and higher education institutions. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. An eligible consortium may include private sector partners, higher education institutions, government entities, economic development groups, financial institutions, and utilities, with a district organization as the lead applicant. The eligible consortiums designated as manufacturing communities can include district organizations, Indian tribes, States, political subdivisions, and special purpose units engaged in economic or infrastructure development activities. The eligible consortiums for manufacturing communities can include special purpose units of State or local governments, institutions of higher education, and public or private nonprofit organizations cooperating with political subdivisions. Regions can be defined by a consortium with approval from the Secretary. Each designation under paragraph (1) for manufacturing communities is for a 2-year period and can be renewed upon application. The consortium defining the region must ensure it is large enough to contain key technologies and small enough for close collaboration among members. Each designation for manufacturing communities is for a 2-year period and can be renewed upon application. The consortium must ensure collaboration among members and may request modifications for renewal. The Secretary may renew a designation for an eligible consortium if there are changes in composition or if a revision to the plan or strategy is submitted. Evaluation for renewal is based on specific criteria set by the Secretary. Evaluation for renewal of an eligible consortium designation is based on performance against previous terms, post-designation awards, and progress on project-specific metrics proposed in the application. The evaluation for renewal of an eligible consortium designation includes assessing project-specific metrics proposed in the application, potential changes to the consortium composition, and other criteria deemed appropriate by the Secretary. An eligible consortium seeking a designation must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries and manufacturing descriptions. Other criteria may be considered by the Secretary for improving US manufacturing competitiveness. The application for designation by an eligible consortium must include details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and an assessment of the local industrial ecosystem. The eligible consortium must provide an integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem, including workforce, supplier network, research, infrastructure, trade, operational improvements, and capital access components needed for manufacturing activities in the region. They must also develop an evidence-based plan for specific investments to address these components. The consortium must provide an evidence-based plan for developing components of the industrial ecosystem, including specific investments to address gaps and make the region uniquely competitive. They should describe the proposed investments, implementation strategy, outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones for tracking progress. The consortium must provide an evidence-based plan for developing components of the industrial ecosystem, including specific investments to address gaps and make the region uniquely competitive. They should describe outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones to track progress, as well as other relevant matters as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate applications based on regional cooperation demonstrated by the applicant. The Secretary evaluates applications based on regional cooperation and manufacturing competitiveness. Previously recognized consortiums are automatically deemed manufacturing communities.
