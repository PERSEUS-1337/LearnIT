    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Medicaid DSH Integrity Act, also known as the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, emphasizes the importance of DSH payments for safety net hospitals serving low-income individuals. The Act includes reporting and auditing requirements to ensure proper use of funds. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued regulations implementing reporting and auditing requirements for Medicaid DSH payments, which may narrow the scope of payments for many States. Congress did not intend to change the definition of DSH-eligible costs or the substantive standards of the existing DSH program. The regulations may result in significant reductions in DSH payments to safety net providers participating in the Medicaid program. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce changes in policy related to the calculation of limits under the Social Security Act. An interim final rule will be published to revise the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as necessary. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes related to Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting, as well as corrections to policy changes for calculating limits under the Social Security Act. This will allow for the inclusion of all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients. CMS will allow inclusion of all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients, even if the patient has insurance that covers other services. States can use their Medicaid plan's definition of allowable costs to compute such costs as long as they do not exceed allowable amounts. CMS will interpret the audit requirement language regarding hospital services consistently with the term \"hospital services\" in the Social Security Act. Additionally, CMS will revise the General DSH Audit and Reporting Protocol as needed. Congress is urged to interpret section 1923(g)(1)(A) more restrictively. CMS will revise the General DSH Audit and Reporting Protocol to allow for the use of different cost-to-charge ratios. Section 455.304(d)(2) will be revised to permit alternative methodologies for determining actual costs. Section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act will be amended to change the initiation requirements from 2004 to 2008. In the Social Security Act, section 1923(j) will be amended to change initiation requirements from 2004 to 2008. Definitions include CMS as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations, and Medicaid DSH program. The term \"Medicaid DSH program\" refers to payment adjustments under section 1923 of the Social Security Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through CMS."
