    "content": "The \"Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2006\" establishes a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, including an initial plebiscite and subsequent procedures. It also addresses applicable laws, requirements, and the availability of funds for the self-determination process. The Congress acknowledges past actions by Presidents Bush and Clinton regarding Puerto Rico's political status, emphasizing the need for periodic referendums to ascertain the will of the people. President George W. Bush's Executive Order 13183 required the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status to issue reports every two years on progress towards determining Puerto Rico's political status. In 2005, the Task Force recommended a federally sanctioned plebiscite for Puerto Ricans to vote on remaining a US territory or pursuing a different status. The Congress is urged to hold a federally sanctioned plebiscite in Puerto Rico for the people to choose between remaining a US territory or pursuing a permanent nonterritorial status. If the latter is chosen, a subsequent plebiscite should be held to select one of the two nonterritorial status options, with Congress beginning a transition process towards the chosen option. If Puerto Rico chooses to remain a US territory, periodic plebiscites should be held to keep Congress informed of the people's wishes. Federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, including initial plebiscite and subsequent procedures. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct a plebiscite in Puerto Rico to choose between continuing the existing territorial status or pursuing a path towards a permanent nonterritorial status. Voters must mark their choice on the ballot, and ballots with more than one option marked will not be counted. If the majority in the first plebiscite favors continued territorial status, further procedures will be followed. The ballot will have two options for voters to choose from, either continuing the existing territorial status or pursuing a permanent nonterritorial status. If the majority in the first plebiscite favors the current status, additional plebiscites will be held every 8 years unless a majority votes for a permanent nonterritorial status. If a majority votes for a permanent nonterritorial status in any plebiscite, the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will proceed accordingly. If a majority vote in a plebiscite favors permanent nonterritorial status, a follow-up plebiscite will be held with options for statehood or becoming a sovereign nation. If a majority vote in a plebiscite favors permanent nonterritorial status, a follow-up plebiscite will be held with options for statehood or becoming a sovereign nation. The two options on the ballot must be marked clearly, and if more than one option is marked, the ballot will not be counted. The plebiscite must be held within a specific timeframe after the certification of the majority vote. SEC. 4. APPLICABLE LAWS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS. All Federal laws applicable to the election of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico also apply to any plebiscite under this Act. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over legal claims related to this Act. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will issue rules for the plebiscites.
