    "content": "In this study, we investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation. Our novel transformer variant outperforms the standard transformer, showing faster convergence and more robust character-level alignments. Character-level models offer a more memory-efficient approach compared to word or subword-level models. Character-level models are more memory-efficient than word or subword-level models. They work directly on raw characters, providing a compact language representation and mitigating out-of-vocabulary problems. Multilingual training using character vocabulary can improve overall performance without increasing model complexity. Self-attention models have achieved success in tasks like machine translation and representation learning, but previous work has not considered their potential in character-level neural machine translation. In this work, the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation is investigated. Two models are considered: the standard transformer and a novel variant called convtransformer, which uses convolution for interactions among nearby character representations. Evaluation is done on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. Translation performance is compared on both close and distant language pairs. The study evaluates self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a standard transformer with a convtransformer variant. Results show that self-attention models perform well for character-level translation, requiring fewer parameters and producing robust alignments. The convtransformer outperforms the standard transformer, converging faster and showing improved alignment. Fully character-level translation was previously explored in a model combining convolutional layers with max pooling and highway layers. Lee et al. (2017) proposed a character-level translation model that combines convolutional layers with max pooling and highway layers for robust alignments. Their approach showed promising results for multilingual translation, with training on multiple source languages improving performance. Character-level models have shown performance improvements and act as regularizers. Multilingual training is possible for languages with similar character vocabularies or through mapping to a common representation. Recent studies compare character and subword-level models, showing that character-level models can outperform subword-level models with sufficient computational time and capacity. The transformer model has achieved state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks without using recurrence. The transformer model, known for its attention-driven encoder-decoder architecture, has shown superior performance in NLP tasks without using recurrence. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of attention in modeling characters, prompting further exploration of character-level bilingual and multilingual translation with the transformer architecture. The convtransformer architecture is proposed to facilitate character-level interactions in the transformer for bilingual and multilingual translation. It includes a modification to the standard encoder blocks with additional sub-blocks consisting of parallel 1D convolutional layers. Different context window sizes are used to capture character interactions at varying levels of granularity. The convtransformer architecture, proposed for bilingual and multilingual translation, includes three parallel 1D convolutional layers with context window sizes of 3, 5, and 7. The representations are fused using an additional convolutional layer without changing the resolution. A residual connection from input to output is added for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on the WMT15 DE\u2192EN dataset to compare results with previous work on character-level translation. The study conducted experiments on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN). The training corpora were constructed by sampling one million sentence pairs from the UN dataset in French, Spanish, and Chinese for translation to English. The BLEU scores on the UN dataset were evaluated for different input training languages. The study constructed training corpora by sampling one million sentence pairs from the UN dataset in French, Spanish, and Chinese for translation to English. Multilingual datasets were created by combining bilingual datasets and shuffling them. Chinese dataset was latinized using the Wubi encoding method. Experiments were designed for bilingual and multilingual scenarios. The study compared different character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset, including a recurrent model and transformers using subword level encoding. The experiments involved bilingual and multilingual scenarios with various language combinations. The study compared character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset, including a recurrent model and transformers using subword level encoding. Character-level training is slower but achieves strong performance, outperforming previous models. Multilingual experiments showed competitive results with fewer parameters. The convtransformer variant performed similarly to the standard transformer. Our convtransformer variant performs similarly to the standard transformer on the UN dataset, with multilingual experiments showing improved performance. The convtransformer consistently outperforms the transformer, with up to 2.3 BLEU gap on bilingual translation (ZH\u2192EN) and up to 2.6 BLEU on multilingual translation (FR+ZH\u2192EN). Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages, while training on distant languages can still be effective. The convtransformer is slower to train than the transformer but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to a speedup in overall training. Distant-language training is effective when the input language is closer to the target translation language. Character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed through attention probabilities. In analyzing character alignments in multilingual models, attention probabilities are compared between multilingual and bilingual models. Multilingual models may learn lower quality alignments due to architecture limitations or dissimilar languages, while bilingual models have greater flexibility. Canonical correlation analysis is used to quantify alignments. To enable effective joint training, the model learns alternative alignment strategies for multiple languages using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Alignment matrices are generated by extracting encoder-decoder attention from the models, and CCA is used to project them to a common vector space. Results show strong positive correlation for similar language pairs, but a decrease in correlation when introducing a distant language during training. The convtransformer shows better robustness to distant languages compared to the transformer in character-level translation tasks. Self-attention models perform well on character-level translation, competing with subword-level models. The standard transformer architecture and a novel variant with convolution in the encoder improve information propagation across characters. Self-attention performs well on character-level translation, competing with subword-level models with fewer parameters. Training on multiple input languages is effective, especially for similar languages. However, performance drops for distant languages. Future work includes analyzing more languages from different families and enhancing training efficiency for character-level models. The study focuses on improving training efficiency of character-level models for bilingual and multilingual translation. Example outputs show that convtransformer models have sharper weight distribution on matching characters and words compared to transformer models. Multilingual translation of close languages is successful for both transformer and convtransformer models. The study compares the performance of convtransformer and transformer models for bilingual and multilingual translation. Convtransformer shows sharper weight distribution on matching characters and words, especially for distant languages, indicating its robustness for multilingual translation. The convtransformer model demonstrates better word alignment for multilingual translation, especially for distant languages. It is noted that the convtransformer is more robust in preserving word alignments compared to the transformer model.
