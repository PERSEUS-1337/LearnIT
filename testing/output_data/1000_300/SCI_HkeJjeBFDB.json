To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing generalization and robustness goals. Noise can improve neural networks training by enhancing generalization and robustness. Introducing variability through noise at input or supervision signals levels can lead to significant improvements in model performance. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" demonstrate how noise can enhance generalization and robustness in models. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising effect on model robustness. The study emphasizes the benefits of incorporating noise in knowledge distillation and the importance of designing compact Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment considering memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. In compressed model performance, knowledge distillation is a key technique involving training a smaller network under a larger pre-trained network's supervision. This method aims to develop compact models that generalize well and are robust to distribution shifts and malicious attacks. Various techniques like model quantization and pruning are used to achieve high performance in compressed models. Knowledge distillation is an interactive learning method where a smaller network (student) is trained under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network (teacher). The goal is to transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student model, but there is still a performance gap between the two models. Capturing knowledge from the larger network and transferring it to a smaller model remains an open question. The importance of reducing the generalization gap between larger and smaller models in knowledge distillation is crucial for real-world deployment. Incorporating methods to improve the student model's robustness to perturbations is essential. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, where neuroplasticity plays a key role in learning, collaboration and interaction with the environment are highlighted as crucial aspects of the learning process. The learning process involves collaboration and interaction with the environment, influenced by cognitive biases and trial-to-trial response variation. Introducing constructive noise in student-teacher collaborative learning may enhance learning outcomes. Incorporating noise in student-teacher collaborative learning can mitigate cognitive bias and improve learning outcomes by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in the brain. This approach aims to prevent memorization and over-generalization in neural networks, ultimately enhancing model generalization and robustness. The study explores the effects of noise on model generalization and robustness in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework. It introduces a method called \"Fickle Teacher\" which transfers teacher model's uncertainty to the student using Dropout, leading to improved generalization. Additionally, Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation enhances the student model's adversarial robustness significantly while minimizing the drop in generalization. The study introduces \"Soft Randomization\" as a method to improve student model's adversarial robustness by using Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation. It also highlights the benefits of random label corruption in reducing cognitive bias and enhancing adversarial robustness with minimal impact on generalization. Noise has been a common regularization technique to improve generalization performance in deep neural networks. Randomization techniques, including noise injection during training and inference, have been proven effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing can transform any classifier into a smoother one with certifiable robustness guarantees. Noise is crucial for non-convex optimization and has been used as a common regularization technique to improve generalization in deep neural networks. Label smoothing, randomized smoothing, and knowledge distillation with constructive noise are effective techniques against adversarial attacks. Label smoothing enhances deep neural network performance, but it may impair knowledge distillation. Combining knowledge distillation with constructive noise could lead to lightweight models with improved robustness. CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen for empirical analysis due to its relevance in knowledge distillation and robustness research. For empirical analysis, CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen for its relevance in knowledge distillation and robustness research. The study focused on lightweight models with improved robustness to adversarial and natural perturbations. The experiments used the Hinton method for noise addition in knowledge distillation, with parameters \u03b1 = 0.9 and \u03c4 = 4. Wide Residual Networks (WRN) were utilized, and ImageNet was used to evaluate out-of-distribution generalization. In the study, different types of noise were injected in the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation to analyze their effects. The evaluation included out-of-distribution generalization using ImageNet from the CINIC dataset, adversarial robustness testing with Projected Gradient Descent attack, and assessing robustness to common corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C. In the study, noise was added to the student-teacher learning framework to analyze its effects on generalization and robustness. Signal-dependent noise was injected into the output logits of the teacher model, showing improvements in generalization to CIFAR-10 test set and slight increases in adversarial and natural robustness of the models. Our method introduces noise to the student-teacher learning framework, enhancing generalization to CIFAR-10 test set and improving adversarial and natural robustness of the models. Unlike previous approaches, we add noise only during knowledge distillation to the student model, utilizing dropout in the teacher model for variability in the supervision signal. Our method enhances generalization and robustness by adding noise to the student model during knowledge distillation. Dropout in the teacher model provides variability in the supervision signal, leading to different output predictions for the same input image. This approach differs from previous methods by using dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for distilling knowledge to a compact student model. Our method enhances generalization and robustness by adding noise to the student model during knowledge distillation. Dropout is used as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for distilling knowledge to a compact student model, differentiating it from previous methods. The student is trained for more epochs using the logits returned by the teacher model with activated dropout to capture the teacher's uncertainty directly. The proposed method aims to improve generalization on unseen and out-of-distribution data, as well as increase robustness to PGD attacks. Performance is compared for dropout rates in the range [0-0.5] at intervals of 0.1. The proposed method improves generalization and robustness by adding noise during knowledge distillation. Training the student model with dropout enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization compared to the Hinton method. Even when the teacher model's performance drops, the student model's performance improves with dropout rates up to 0.4. PGD Robustness and natural robustness increase with dropout rates up to 0.2, supporting the hypothesis that trial-to-trial variability aids in distilling knowledge to the student model. Adding Gaussian noise during knowledge distillation improves generalization and robustness. The method combines the teacher model trained on clean images with random Gaussian noise to retain adversarial robustness while mitigating the loss in generalization. Our method involves minimizing a loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, using a teacher model trained on clean images to train the student model with random Gaussian noise. By incorporating six Gaussian noise levels, we observed increased adversarial robustness and decreased generalization. Our approach outperforms compact models trained with Gaussian noise alone, showing improvements in both generalization and robustness. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to compact models trained with Gaussian noise alone, achieving higher adversarial robustness and improved generalization. The method also enhances robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blurring, while showing varying effects at different noise intensities. Our method enhances adversarial robustness and generalization by introducing label noise during training, improving robustness to common corruptions like noise and blurring. The effect varies at different noise intensities, with lower noise levels increasing robustness for some corruptions. During training, label noise is introduced by randomly changing target labels to improve model generalization and prevent overconfidence in predictions. This method has not been explored extensively but has shown potential in improving tolerance to noisy labels. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization, showing improvements in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios during knowledge distillation to the student model. The study demonstrates that random label corruption during knowledge distillation to the student model improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Training with random labels also enhances adversarial robustness, with a significant increase observed even with 5% random labels. The study shows that introducing variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise improves generalization and robustness. The Fickle teacher method enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization significantly, while also slightly improving robustness to perturbations. Soft randomization greatly boosts adversarial robustness of the student model trained with Gaussian noise at lower intensities. Soft randomization improves adversarial robustness and generalization in knowledge distillation. Random label corruption enhances adversarial robustness and generalization significantly. Injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability shows promise in training compact models with good generalization and robustness. In knowledge distillation, Hinton et al. proposed using a final softmax function with raised temperature and smooth logits from the teacher model as soft targets for the student model. The method minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities, improving generalization. Domain shift can impact model generalization, but techniques like soft randomization and random label corruption can enhance adversarial robustness and generalization. To evaluate model generalization, test set performance alone is not sufficient due to domain shift. ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset are used to measure out-of-distribution performance. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The performance of models trained on CIFAR-10 on 21000 images approximates out-of-distribution performance. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to the need for robustness evaluation and defense strategies. In this study, the adversarial robustness of models is evaluated using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. The PGD-N attack initializes the adversarial image with the original image and random noise within an epsilon bound. The projection operator clips the image within the epsilon bound and valid data range. Five random initializations are used, and the worst adversarial robustness is reported. The projection operator clips images within a specified range to ensure robustness to adversarial attacks. Deep Neural Networks must also be robust to natural perturbations encountered in real-world environments. Recent studies have shown vulnerabilities to common real-world perturbations, highlighting the importance of natural robustness. In a study, researchers curated real-world examples causing classifier accuracy to degrade and measured model's robustness to natural transformations. They found state-of-the-art classifiers to be brittle to these transformations. The study used robustness to common corruptions as a proxy for natural robustness. It is important to balance generalization and adversarial robustness in models to ensure robustness to both perturbations. While ensuring model robustness to adversarial attacks, it is crucial to also consider its impact on in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, as well as natural perturbations and distribution shifts. Studies have shown that adversarially trained models may compromise natural robustness and exhibit a trade-off between robustness to different types of perturbations. Adversarially trained models improve robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but not low frequency perturbations common in the real world. Studies show a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. Proposed random swapping noise methods exploit teacher model uncertainty for a sample by swapping softmax logits based on a threshold. Two variants are Swap Top 2 and Swap All for consecutive pairs.

Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs to capture the uncertainty of the teacher model. The student model is trained with different dropout rates for varying numbers of epochs to capture the uncertainty of the teacher model. Adversarial robustness is tested by introducing noise on the supervision from the teacher, which improves accuracy on unseen data but not generalization to out-of-distribution data.
