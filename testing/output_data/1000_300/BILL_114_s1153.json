    "content": "The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims any right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" mandates a new survey to identify the current South Bank boundary line along the affected area. The survey must adhere to specific criteria and be completed within 2 years. The Secretary will submit the survey to the Texas General Land Office for approval. SEC. 4. APPEAL. Private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge within 1 year of survey approval. SEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. No affected area parcels are treated as Federal land until survey approval and no further appeals. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. States and Indian tribes' rights over lands north of the Red River are unaffected. SEC. 7. SALE OF REMAINING RED RIVER SURFACE RIGHTS. After survey approval and resolution of any appeals, identified Federal lands will be offered for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales are subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights, with proceeds used to offset Act-related costs. A report is required within 5 years of enactment. Net proceeds from the sale of identified Federal lands will be used to offset Act-related costs. The Secretary must submit a report to the House and Senate committees listing unsold lands and reasons for not selling them within 5 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"affected area\" as lands along the Red River, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"South Bank\" as the elevation along the southerly side of the river. The Act defines terms related to the Red River boundary, including the South Bank boundary line identified through the gradient boundary survey method. The term \"gradient boundary survey method\" refers to the technique used to locate the South Bank boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River, recognizing changes due to erosion and accretion as specified in a Supreme Court decree."
