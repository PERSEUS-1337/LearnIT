    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This section aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for all K-12 students. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their overall health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Participation in quality physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight youth has more than doubled in the past 30 years. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be healthier and more physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity in children. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths each year. Physically fit adults have reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke, yet children are not as active as they should be, with less than 1 in 4 getting 20 minutes of vigorous activity daily. The Surgeon General's 1996 Report and the Centers for Disease Control recommend daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, but little progress has been made since Congress passed a resolution in 1987. Despite recommendations from the Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control for daily physical education programs for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, little progress has been made in providing high-quality physical education opportunities. Every student should have the chance to participate in quality physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for adopting healthy lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes of instructional physical education per week and incorporating fitness education and assessment. The physical education program for secondary school students includes 150 minutes of weekly instruction, fitness education, motor skill development, cognitive concepts for lifelong health, and opportunities for social and cooperative skills through physical activity. The physical education program for secondary school students emphasizes lifelong healthy lifestyle support, social skills development, multicultural perspective, appropriate physical activity, and instruction in healthy eating habits. Teachers must have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development to stay updated in the field. Teachers of physical education must have professional development to stay updated on research, issues, and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not part of the assisted physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Funds may include participation of home-schooled and private school students. Reporting is required for continued funding. The administrator of a local educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary to continue receiving funding for multiyear grants or contracts. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing the success of programs improving physical fitness and making recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed. SEC. 10999J limits administrative costs to 7% of grant funds. SEC. 10999K states the Federal share cannot exceed 90% in the first year and 75% in subsequent years, and funds should supplement, not supplant other funds. SEC. 10999L authorizes appropriations. \"Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000, $70,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively, to carry out this part, with funds remaining available until expended.\""
