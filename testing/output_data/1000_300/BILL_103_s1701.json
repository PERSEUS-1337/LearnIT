    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Social Security Administration Services Preservation Act\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress recognizes the importance of public goodwill and accessibility of Social Security Administration offices for all citizens, especially the handicapped and elderly, in providing personal attention to their needs. The procedures for closing, consolidating, and relocating Social Security Administration offices are inconsistent and often informal, leading to discrepancies between formal procedures and actual practice. These decisions have not adequately considered the needs of citizens, especially the handicapped and elderly, and should be made in a way that maintains public confidence in the agency. The Act aims to protect public interest in decisions regarding Social Security Administration office closures, consolidations, and relocations. It also establishes fair procedures to be followed in such decisions, ensuring that public confidence in the agency is maintained. The Act amends Title VII of the Social Security Act to address the consolidation, closing, or recategorization of Social Security Administration offices.

Section 712 defines 'adequate public notice' and 'move' in relation to office changes. The Act defines terms related to office changes by the Social Security Administration, including 'move' and 'recategorize'. It specifies that a move within the same political subdivision due to lease loss or space needs is not considered a move. The Social Security Administration must provide public notice at least 90 days before closing, consolidating, or downgrading an office. Factors considered include community impact and accessibility. When recategorizing an office, the Social Security Administration considers the impact on the community, the need for personal service, the effect on employees, and the economic savings. The Social Security Administration requires approval for closing full-time offices and considers economic savings when making changes. Any decision to close, consolidate, or recategorize an office must be in writing and include findings. A public hearing must be held upon request, no earlier than 60 days after adequate notice. The Social Security Administration must hold a public hearing upon request, no earlier than 60 days after notice, to discuss proposals to consolidate, close, or recategorize offices. The hearing must be conducted at or near the affected office by an official designated by the regional or central office. Within 30 days after the hearing, a final report incorporating all testimony and comments received must be issued. The Social Security Administration must issue a final report after a public hearing on proposals to close, consolidate, or recategorize offices. The report must specify the final determination and be sent to the local press, Members of Congress, and provide public notice. Any person affected by the determination can appeal to the Commissioner of Social Security. Any person affected by the closure, consolidation, or recategorization of a Social Security Administration office can appeal to the Commissioner of Social Security within 30 days of public notice. The Commissioner will review the appeal based on the record and can overturn any decision that is deemed arbitrary, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by evidence. No action can be taken to close, move, or recategorize an office until the appeal process is completed. No action can be taken to close, move, or recategorize any Social Security Administration office without following the required legal procedures or having substantial evidence on record. The agency must provide a list of closed or discontinued offices in its annual budget submission to Congress."
