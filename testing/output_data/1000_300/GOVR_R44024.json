    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amendments to TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process. Since its enactment in 1976, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has seen additions and amendments targeting specific chemical concerns, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills introduced since 2005 aim to revise the chemical evaluation process, but there is ongoing legislative debate on amending regulatory criteria and other elements of the law. With more chemicals entering the U.S. market and evolving scientific understanding of chemical risks, proponents argue for amending TSCA's risk management provisions. Proponents argue for amending TSCA's risk management provisions due to evolving scientific understanding of chemical risks and the need for a more protective regulatory framework. State regulations addressing specific chemical concerns not covered by EPA under TSCA have led to potential inconsistencies in chemical regulation across states, causing inefficiencies for manufacturers and processors in interstate commerce. Proponents of state regulations argue for different approaches to chemical regulation, allowing states to lead in protecting citizens. Non-governmental programs like labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic\" offer alternative regulatory methods. This report tracks legislative status in the 114th Congress for amending TSCA, focusing on key issues without providing a comprehensive analysis of all provisions. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725). Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for Senate floor consideration. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including S. 697 and S. 725. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for Senate floor consideration. On April 7, 2015, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce announced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which was later revised and forwarded to the full committee on May 14, 2015. On April 14, 2015, the House subcommittee held a hearing on the discussion draft. On May 14, 2015, the subcommittee approved the revised draft for full committee consideration. H.R. 2576, known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced on May 26, 2015, based on the approved draft. The bill was later approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 3, 2015. On June 23, 2015, the House passed H.R. 2576 with amendments on a 398-1 vote. The House passed H.R. 2576 on June 23, 2015, with a 398-1 vote. The bill addresses various issues related to the federal regulation of chemical substances under Title I of TSCA, including prioritization of substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting substances, EPA's authority for regulation, development of new information, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information to EPA, and resources for EPA administration. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues such as the preemption of state laws, disclosure of information to EPA, and resources for EPA administration. EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical risks under the current TSCA, with no mandate to review all chemicals. The selection criteria for evaluating chemicals remains a challenge due to limited resources. The EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical risks under the current TSCA, with over 83,000 chemical substances potentially in U.S. commerce. In 2012, EPA prioritized 90 substances for evaluation based on hazard, exposure, and bioaccumulation potential, assessing five so far. EPA prioritized 90 chemical substances for evaluation based on hazard, exposure, and bioaccumulation potential. Of these, five have been assessed for risks to human health or the environment. Manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days prior to manufacturing new chemicals, allowing EPA to evaluate risks and determine if regulation is necessary. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. The EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 would prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 would evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. H.R. 2576 would give EPA discretion to assess chemicals with potential unreasonable risks. S. 697 and S. 725 differ in prioritization factors and criteria. Both Senate bills would divide existing chemical substances into active and inactive categories. The Senate bills aim to prioritize existing chemical substances for evaluation based on various factors, including dividing them into active and inactive categories. Manufacturers can request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee, with EPA having discretion to grant a limited number of requests. Regulatory action will be taken based on the results of risk-based safety evaluations. The Senate bills (S. 697 and S. 725) establish a prioritization process for evaluating chemical substances. EPA can prioritize substances for evaluation upon request and payment of a fee. Under S. 697, EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessment within five years. Regulatory actions will be based on risk-based safety evaluations. The Senate bills (S. 697 and S. 725) aim to designate active substances as high-priority or low-priority in a timely manner, with EPA required to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and start safety assessments within five years. Safety assessments must be completed within three years of designation, with rules promulgated within two years of a negative safety determination. H.R. 2576 requires risk evaluations to be published within three years of a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they pay for the evaluation. It does not amend TSCA Section 5 for new chemical substances and significant new uses. H.R. 2576 would establish a process for EPA to review information submitted by manufacturers and processors regarding new chemicals. EPA would need to make a determination within 90 days of receiving a PMN for new chemicals, assessing if regulatory action is necessary based on safety standards. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to prioritization and safety measures. The current TSCA establishes a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the risk of injury to human health or the environment. This criterion is used to determine regulatory actions for new and existing chemicals under Sections 5 and 6. Some argue that the regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals under TSCA is challenging for the EPA to prove and open to interpretation. There is a debate on amending the threshold to clarify criteria for determining regulatory control, as the current \"unreasonable risk\" standard is not clearly defined in statute. The interpretation of this standard as a multi-factor balancing test has been established in court cases like Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA. The Fifth Circuit interpreted TSCA's \"unreasonable risk\" standard as a multi-factor balancing test in the influential 1991 decision, Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA. The court emphasized the need for EPA to consider the costs and carry out actions in a reasonable and prudent manner, balancing environmental, economic, and social impacts. The court ruled that EPA had ignored the cost side of the TSCA equation in its asbestos ban. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard. S. 697 would define \"safety standard\" as \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" with added qualifiers. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" using the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" and adding qualifiers, including the consideration of \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" and prohibiting the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors\" in evaluating risks. S. 725, like S. 697, defines a safety standard without considering cost or non-risk factors. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting the consideration of costs or non-risk factors in evaluating risks. Under Section 6(a) of TSCA, regulatory controls are authorized to address unreasonable risks by balancing costs and benefits. EPA must choose the least burdensome regulatory requirement to protect against unreasonable risks, considering factors like costs and availability of alternatives. Regulatory requirements can range from a complete ban to notifying distributors of risks. Some argue that EPA's limit to choose the least burdensome requirement may hinder effective regulation. The EPA is subject to regulatory control and must choose the least burdensome regulatory requirement to protect against unreasonable risks. In a case, it was argued that EPA's total ban on ongoing asbestos uses may not be the least burdensome adequate alternative. The \"least burdensome\" requirement adds an extra standard for EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risks. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome regulatory option requirement for restricting chemical substances. Instead, they propose directing EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary\" for meeting safety standards, considering factors like costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to promulgate a rule that adequately protects against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations. It would also amend factors for considering restrictions on chemical substances to be cost-effective, except when not practicable. All three bills allow EPA to exempt certain chemical uses under specific circumstances. EPA would be authorized to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of chemical substances under H.R. 2576 if certain conditions are met, such as national security concerns or significant disruption to the economy. The exemptions would aim to reduce risk to the greatest extent feasible and would initially be in effect for a maximum of five years. EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for specific uses of chemical substances to reduce risk. Exemptions are initially valid for up to five years and can be renewed if requirements are met. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and may require reporting from manufacturers to gather necessary data. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) mandates EPA to require manufacturers and processors to conduct testing if a chemical substance may present unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced that may enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. EPA has mandated additional testing for over 200 chemical substances, sparking debates on the agency's authority under TSCA. EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances under TSCA. There are debates on EPA's authority to require new information on the health and environmental effects of chemicals, which may be time-consuming and costly for those involved. EPA typically assesses risks based on production volume and exposure likelihood. The EPA has required testing for over 200 chemical substances under TSCA, with debates on its authority to mandate new information. Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 would give EPA discretion to require testing, while H.R. 2576 would still require certain findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. All three bills authorize EPA to require new information through rulemaking, orders, or testing agreements. The three bills would authorize EPA to require new information through rulemaking, orders, or testing agreements, with a provision to minimize animal testing. TSCA preemption remains a key issue with the increasing number of state chemical regulations. Congress can preempt state action entirely or allow varying degrees of state action under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Congress can preempt state action under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Current TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some flexibility to set their own requirements. States are generally preempted from managing risk if EPA has taken similar action, with exceptions for identical state and federal requirements. In the context of TSCA preemption, states can apply for waivers, but exceptions exist for state requirements that are identical to federal ones. States can enforce federal requirements as their own, regulate disposal, establish chemical requirements, and prohibit certain chemical uses within the state. Advocates of broader federal preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework to mitigate compliance costs and conflicting regulations. Advocates of a uniform national regulatory framework argue that federal preemption can reduce compliance costs and conflicting regulations. Opponents believe states should have the flexibility to implement more stringent policies to protect their citizens. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to act if EPA has not taken action on a chemical. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to act if EPA has not taken action on a chemical. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals that meet EPA safety standards or are restricted by EPA. Additionally, states cannot impose new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority for safety assessment by EPA. S. 697 would restrict states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals listed as high priority for safety assessment by EPA, with preemption beginning upon EPA defining the scope of the safety assessment. If EPA determines a chemical meets the safety standard, preemption continues; if not, preemption is lifted until EPA restricts the chemical. Exceptions to preemption provided by current TSCA would generally be retained, except for the removal of the exception allowing states to prohibit chemical use. S. 697 would retain preemption exceptions under current TSCA, except for states prohibiting chemical use. New provisions would prevent states from imposing duplicate or stricter penalties. Certain state actions before August 1, 2015, and under laws in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be preempted. Savings clauses would clarify common law or statutory causes of action. S. 697 would add savings clauses to clarify that state actions under existing laws before August 31, 2003, would not be preempted. States could apply for waivers based on peer-reviewed science, and EPA would have to grant them if requirements were met. In contrast, S. 725 would eliminate TSCA's preemption provisions. H.R. 2576 would make changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to impose different regulations for chemicals if EPA had not taken action. It would preempt state laws only if EPA determined a chemical did not pose an unreasonable risk. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals based on EPA risk management actions, aligning preemption with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption, and states could enforce identical requirements to EPA with penalties and sanctions. H.R. 2576 aligns state requirements with EPA actions, allowing states to enforce identical requirements with penalties and sanctions. The bill also addresses concerns about public access to chemical information while protecting confidential data under TSCA. The TSCA prohibits disclosure of certain information to protect trade secrets and confidential data. Wrongful disclosure is considered a criminal act under TSCA. The TSCA prohibits disclosure of certain information to protect trade secrets and confidential data. Wrongful disclosure is considered a criminal act under TSCA. CBI protection under TSCA allows for disclosure of health and safety studies but protects manufacturing processes and proprietary compositions. EPA can disclose CBI if necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify the submitter before disclosing CBI if it does not meet protection standards. EPA must notify the submitter before disclosing information designated as CBI if it does not meet protection standards. CBI protection for confidential information continues indefinitely unless EPA determines it no longer qualifies for protection. EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has also initiated a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" for industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims. The EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, specifically regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has also launched a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" for industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims. The three proposed bills would require or authorize EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances, such as in response to requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, requests from certain federal or state professionals in response to an environmental release, or requests from health care professionals to assist in diagnoses or treatments of patients. The Senate bills would make more extensive revisions and additions to Section 14. The Senate bills propose more extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA than H.R. 2576, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. They would protect certain categories of information from disclosure, including chemical identity before commercial distribution, but not for chemicals subject to a ban. H.R. 2576 would protect chemical identities in health and safety studies. The Senate bills propose extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. They protect certain categories of information from disclosure, including chemical identity before commercial distribution, but not for banned chemicals. H.R. 2576 would protect chemical identities in health and safety studies and require substantiation of confidentiality claims every 10 years. EPA's ability to evaluate chemical risks under TSCA depends on available resources, raising the question of funding sources for EPA activities. The funding of EPA's activities under TSCA is a key issue for Congress. Options include continuing funding through discretionary appropriations or establishing dedicated funding sources. Congress has funded EPA's TSCA implementation through annual appropriations and fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. EPA's authority to collect fees is limited to $2,500 for certain actions under Section 5 of the statute. EPA has the authority to assess fees on manufacturers, importers, or processors under TSCA. The fees are limited to $2,500 for specific actions required under Section 5 of the statute, with an exception for small businesses capped at $100. EPA can also assess fees for evaluating testing data under Section 4. There is no dedicated account for these fees collected under Section 26(b). Fees collected under TSCA for evaluating testing data are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under TSCA Section 26(b) to varying degrees. S. 697 would authorize the collection of fees to accompany submissions of information to EPA for chemical evaluation, with fees set to provide sustainable funding. The total amount collected would be capped at $18 million, with receipts deposited into a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions. The bill would authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for chemical evaluations, with receipts deposited into a dedicated fund. The fees would be used to cover costs of evaluating information submissions, without a limit on the amount collected per submission. The bills H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 would authorize EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers for administering TSCA. The fees would be deposited into a dedicated fund without a limit on the amount collected per submission. The bills H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 authorize EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers for TSCA administration. Fees collected would be deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Congressional Budget Office cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576 are available in S.Rept. 114-67 and H.Rept. 114-176."
