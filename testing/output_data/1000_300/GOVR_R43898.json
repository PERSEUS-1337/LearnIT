    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. A number of provisions that had expired were temporarily extended through 2013, and most provisions that expired in 2013 were retroactively extended through 2014. Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. Most provisions that expired at the end of 2013 were retroactively extended through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 either made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. Temporary tax provisions regularly extended by Congress are known as \"tax extenders.\" The research tax credit, for example, was extended multiple times before being made permanent. In the 114th Congress, debate on tax extenders focused on expired tax provisions. In 114th Congress, debate focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. P.L. 114-113 extended all expired tax provisions, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, some provisions are still set to expire at the end of 2016, prompting further debate. The 114th Congress debated whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. P.L. 114-113 extended all expired tax provisions, but some are still set to expire at the end of 2016, leading to further debate on whether they should be extended. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) extended expired tax provisions through the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), making some provisions permanent and including a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The PATH Act of 2015 made permanent key tax credits and included a two-year moratorium on certain taxes. Other tax-related provisions were also extended through the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. Legislation like the EXPIRE Act proposed further extensions. The 113th Congress passed legislation to extend expiring tax provisions for one year, with other proposals for two-year extensions and permanent provisions. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 aimed to make certain provisions permanent, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances. In the 114th Congress, the House passed legislation to permanently extend certain expired provisions. In the 114th Congress, the House passed legislation to permanently extend certain expired provisions related to tax credits and expensing allowances. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend temporary provisions that expired at the end of 2014 for two years, making them available for the 2015 and 2016 tax year. S. 1946 aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014, including one provision from 2013. The tax code has many temporary provisions, often extended by Congress in \"tax extender\" packages for short periods. Congress may choose temporary provisions for various reasons. The number of tax extenders has grown as new temporary provisions are routinely added to the package. Congress enacts temporary tax provisions for various reasons such as evaluating effectiveness, providing relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. Temporary provisions allow for evaluation before further extension. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows for evaluation before extension, but the lack of systematic review undermines this purpose. The expiration date is meant to prompt policymakers to assess costs and benefits, but in practice, there is no real systematic review. The special tax treatment and possible changes to increase policy effectiveness have not been systematically reviewed. Tax provisions are traditionally passed as a package without careful analysis. Some provisions, like tax incentives for ethanol, have not been extended due to duplicative benefits. Congress may choose not to extend provisions based on evaluation results. The Government Accountability Office found that tax credits for ethanol under the renewable fuel standard were duplicative and did not increase consumption. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the cost. Tax policy can be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief, such as bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Other temporary provisions have included mortgage forgiveness exclusion, payroll tax cuts, and grants in lieu of tax credits. The government may enact temporary tax provisions for various reasons, such as economic stimulus or disaster relief. These provisions, like mortgage forgiveness exclusion and payroll tax cuts, are often allowed to expire once the situation is resolved. Temporary tax cuts are easier to offset in the budget than long-term extensions, and the Congressional Budget Office assumes they will expire as scheduled under current law. Temporary tax provisions are easier to offset in the budget than long-term extensions. The Congressional Budget Office assumes they will expire as scheduled under current law, potentially overstating projected revenues. This makes the long-term revenue outlook stronger by having a smaller effect on the fiscal outlook. Temporary tax benefits act as federal subsidies, favoring eligible activities and influencing economic behavior and resource allocation. Temporary tax benefits, known as extenders, act as federal subsidies that favor eligible activities and influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating extenders involves considering their impact on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. They may encourage more of a certain activity but can lead to market distortions. Policymakers must prioritize economic objectives when deciding on extenders. Tax extenders can influence economic behavior by encouraging specific activities. Market failures may justify tax distortions for improved economic efficiency. Extenders should address market failures to be effective, and direct spending programs may be more successful than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Fair taxes contribute to socially desirable outcomes. Tax extenders can lead to unequal tax burdens based on subsidized activities, deviating from horizontal equity standards. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens based on ability to pay. Extenders are often seen as inequitable as they benefit those with higher incomes. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens based on ability to pay. Tax extenders are often considered inequitable as they disproportionately benefit those with higher incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. An example illustrating this is two teachers eligible for a tax deduction, where the benefit differs based on their income tax brackets. The tax code's complexity, exacerbated by extenders, results in higher costs for both the government and individual taxpayers. This complexity also leads to inequities in tax benefits, with higher-income taxpayers receiving greater deductions compared to lower-income taxpayers. The tax code's complexity, worsened by temporary tax provisions, increases costs for the government and individual taxpayers. Extenders lead to inequities in tax benefits, with higher-income taxpayers receiving more deductions. Dozens of temporary tax provisions expired in 2014 but were extended in P.L. 114-113. These provisions fall into categories like individual, business, charitable, or energy. The cost of the extension in P.L. 114-113 is detailed in Table 1. The tax code's complexity is worsened by temporary tax provisions, leading to increased costs for the government and taxpayers. Dozens of temporary tax provisions expired in 2014 but were extended in P.L. 114-113, falling into categories like individual, business, charitable, or energy. Table 1 details the cost of the extension. Six individual tax extender provisions expired in 2014, including the above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses, which was made permanent in P.L. 114-113. Other provisions that have been extended multiple times include deductions for state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits. Several tax provisions were extended more than once, including deductions for state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits. Additionally, long-standing provisions that expired in 2014 include the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond allocation limitation, and the active financing exception under Subpart F. The New Markets Tax Credit, aimed at promoting investment in low-income communities, also expired. Several business-related tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, including the New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances. However, some provisions were made permanent, such as the research tax credit and enhanced expensing under Section 179. Other provisions, like the New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation, were extended through 2019. Table 1 provides more details on the status of various business tax extenders. The New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation were extended through 2019. Four charitable provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, with the renewable energy production tax credit extended through 2016 and wind PTC extended through 2019. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, with a phase-down for wind starting in 2017. Various energy-related tax provisions from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 were also extended through 2016 in the same legislation. Certain tax incentives for alternative technology vehicles and alternative fuel vehicle refueling property, including the alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles, were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. Incentives for other alternative motor vehicles expired at earlier dates, such as the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles which expired at the end of 2013. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, with Congress regularly acting to temporarily extend expired or expiring tax provisions. The cost of the tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 was higher due to certain provisions being made permanent. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 cost $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $426.8 billion attributed to specific provisions. Permanent extensions accounted for $559.5 billion, or 89% of the total cost. The cost of extending the \"tax extender\" provisions in P.L. 114-113 is estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of the total cost is associated with permanent extensions, totaling $559.5 billion. Only a small portion, less than 3%, was for the two-year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014 through 2016. Legislation in the House considered making certain temporary tax provisions permanent before P.L. 114-113 was passed. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015, the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946), to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The cost of extending these provisions, as proposed in S. 1946, was estimated at $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window, excluding macroeconomic effects. The cost of extending expired tax provisions, as proposed in S. 1946, was $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window. Including macroeconomic effects, the cost estimate is lower due to expected increased economic growth from certain provisions. Despite potential offset by higher interest rates, JCT's analysis shows increased economic growth within the budget window, leading to a lower cost estimate for S. 1946. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016 to 2025 budget window. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to various tax credits. Extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would cost $897.9 billion, including bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and various tax credit expansions. Most of these provisions had expired by 2014, leading to higher revenue projections by CBO. The cost of providing a short-term extension for expiring tax provisions is less than extending them through the budget window, resulting in higher revenue projections by CBO. This discrepancy leads to smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline compared to actual deficits likely to occur. The CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) scores the budget impact of temporary tax provisions, such as bonus depreciation, which may have a higher short-term cost compared to the long-term cost. For example, the one-year extension of bonus depreciation in 2015 cost $45.3 billion, but over a 10-year budget window, it was $1.2 billion. Extending provisions like bonus depreciation through 2019 cost $11.3 billion. The one-year revenue loss of the bonus depreciation provision in 2015 was $45.3 billion, but over a 10-year budget window, it was $1.2 billion. Extending bonus depreciation through 2019 cost $11.3 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over the 10-year budget window. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over a 10-year budget window. Legislation in the 114th Congress made certain temporary tax provisions permanent and extended others temporarily. Action on tax extenders was also seen in the 113th Congress. The Senate Finance Committee reported a bill to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016.

The House passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179. Three expired charitable provisions were part of the America Gives More Act of 2015. The proposed measures would have cost $317.5 billion over a 10-year budget window.

Legislation was passed to extend certain tax extender provisions, including the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and the EXPIRE Act. During the 113th Congress, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law, extending expiring provisions through 2015. The House passed legislation to make nine provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. During the 113th Congress, legislation was passed to make nine provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Some charitable-related provisions were included in the Jobs for America Act and the America Gives More Act of 2014. Additionally, two international-related extender provisions were proposed to be made permanent but were not considered by the full House. Some provisions that had expired in 2013 were not extended as part of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, but have since been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not extended in P.L. 113-295 but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 and has been modified and retroactively extended through December 31, 2019. The credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles was not extended in P.L. 113-295 but would have been extended by the EXPIRE Act. Incentives for various alternative technology vehicles have expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. Other energy-related provisions were not extended past their termination date in January 2014. The EXPIRE Act did not extend two energy-related provisions that expired in January 2014: partial expensing for certain refinery property and the credit for energy efficient appliances. Additionally, two disaster-related provisions, including tax-exempt bond financing for facilities in the New York Liberty Zone, were not extended."
