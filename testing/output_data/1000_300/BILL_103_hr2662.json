Section 8 of the Small Business Act is amended to allow participating agencies to enter into contracts with small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals. This includes using restricted competition or offering a price preference of up to 10%. The term \"participating agency\" refers to any Federal agency except the Department of Defense. The Small Business Act allows participating agencies, excluding the Department of Defense, to contract with small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals through restricted competition or a price preference of up to 10%. The authority for this provision is effective until September 30, 2000. Eligibility of past development program participants for Section 8(a) contract awards.

The Small Business Act is amended to allow small businesses to participate in programs based on industry sector study or before eligibility expires. SEC. 8. COMPLIANCE WITH BUY INDIAN ACT. Federal agencies contracting with the Small Business Administration under section 8(a) for goods or services from economically disadvantaged Indian tribes are considered compliant with the Buy Indian Act.
