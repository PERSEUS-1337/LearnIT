    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring states to offer a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to all such children. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of disabled children in private schools, with benefits comparable to those in public schools. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, regulations required local education agencies to provide equitable participation in program benefits to private school students, with benefits comparable to those in public schools. The vagueness of the statute led to differences among states and courts, with some giving broad discretion to local authorities resulting in fewer services for children with disabilities in private schools. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a provision for children with disabilities in private schools to receive special education and related services funded by federal funds under Part B of IDEA. This change aimed to ensure equal services for children in private schools, addressing previous disparities in services provided. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a provision for children with disabilities in private schools to receive special education and related services funded by federal funds under Part B of IDEA. These services could be provided on the premises of private schools, including parochial schools, and \"child find\" provisions applied to children enrolled in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization further clarified the responsibilities of LEAs to ensure fair and equitable services for these children. The 2004 reauthorization clarified the responsibilities of LEAs to ensure fair and equitable services for children with disabilities in private schools. The changes aim to resolve contentious issues and ensure services are provided in a fair manner. Children with disabilities may be placed in private schools by the LEA or SEA to fulfill the FAPE requirement, with costs covered by the LEA. Parents can also unilaterally place their child in a private school, with costs not covered unless certain findings are made. IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if parents place them there. The 2004 reauthorization made changes for children placed in private schools by parents, while provisions for children placed by public agencies remained unchanged. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes for children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents. These children are entitled to special education and related services, with the requirement that they be located in the school district served by the LEA. This change aims to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools across district lines. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes for children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents to protect LEAs from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions. Controversy has arisen due to issues such as disproportional effects on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. Five requirements exist for children parentally placed in private schools, including equal funding for services. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added requirements for children parentally placed in private schools, including equal funding for services. The emphasis is on providing direct services like instructional activities rather than indirect services. LEAs must consult with private school representatives and conduct a thorough child find process. The new provision added to the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to conduct a thorough child find process to determine the number of children with disabilities in private schools. Services may be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools. State and local funds can supplement but not supplant federal funds for services. Each LEA must maintain compliance with these requirements. The new provision in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to conduct a thorough child find process in private schools, including religious schools. State and local funds can supplement but not supplant federal funds for services. Each LEA must maintain records of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions. The term \"religious\" replaces \"parochial\" in the new law. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to conduct child find for children with disabilities in private schools, including religious schools. New provisions include equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. Child find must ensure accurate count and participation of private school children with disabilities. Cost of child find activities cannot be used to meet spending obligations. Child find for private school children must be completed in a timeframe comparable to public school students. LEAs must consult with private school officials and representatives. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to conduct child find for children with disabilities in private schools, including religious schools. New provisions include equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. LEAs must consult with private school officials and representatives regarding child find process and federal fund allocation for parentally placed private school children with disabilities. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA mandates LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities on the provision of special education services, including types of services, apportionment of funds, and decision-making process. The consultation process is similar to that in the No Child Left Behind Act. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities on special education services. The consultation process is similar to that in the No Child Left Behind Act and includes written affirmation of consultation and compliance procedures. Private school officials can submit complaints to the SEA if they feel consultation was not meaningful or timely. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA requires LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities on special education services. Private school officials have the right to submit complaints to the SEA if they feel consultation was not meaningful or timely. If dissatisfied with the SEA's determination, they can escalate the complaint to the Secretary of Education. Services provided must be secular, neutral, and nonideological as per the new law. The new law requires equitable services to be provided by public agency employees or through contract. Funds for private school pupils are controlled by the public agency. Reimbursement for private school placement of children with disabilities is subject to certain findings and notice requirements. The cost of reimbursement is not to be paid by the LEA unless specified by a hearing officer or court. The new law states that reimbursement for private school placement of children with disabilities may not be reduced or denied if certain notice requirements are not met. Exceptions include situations where the school prevented the parent from providing notice, the parents were unaware of the notice requirement, or compliance would likely harm the child. Additionally, reimbursement may not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate, unable to write in English, or if compliance would result in serious emotional harm to the child. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. upheld that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district, regardless of the notice requirement. The Court, in a 4-4 decision, upheld that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even without receiving special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
