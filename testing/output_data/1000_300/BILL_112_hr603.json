State assistance under SEC. 172 involves the Secretary making competitive grants to States for carrying out required activities. Payments are allocated based on a formula considering the number of individuals to be served. SEC. 173 focuses on individualized transition plans. Each State receiving assistance must develop an individual transition plan for individuals with developmental disabilities transitioning into adulthood. The plan aims to coordinate services for integrated employment, postsecondary education, independent living, and community engagement. The plan should be coordinated with existing transition services and developed within 30 days after exiting secondary school. An individualized education program must be developed for individuals with disabilities before exiting secondary school, applicable until age 26, reviewed annually, and developed in in-person meetings led by the State's intellectual and developmental disabilities agency.
