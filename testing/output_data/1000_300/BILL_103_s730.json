    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and disrupted domestic grain prices. The exports continue to increase without limits, further harming U.S. farmers each year. The Congress approved the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement with conditions related to consultations on the Canadian Wheat Board's price setting policy affecting goods exported to the United States. The implementing legislation required the President to enter into discussions to determine prices for agricultural goods. The United States has not made progress on consultations with Canada regarding the exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. This failure led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. The United States' failure to pursue consultations with Canada regarding the exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. Negotiations with Canada are required to determine the price of agricultural goods sold by the Canadian Wheat Board to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. If negotiations under subsection (a) fail, Canada will be in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, leading to the suspension of all Canadian grain imports to the US until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 102. The President must negotiate with Canada to exclude Canadian agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from these rates will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. The President must negotiate with Canada to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers, and other subsidies related to grain. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended. If negotiations fail to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must assist petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program can be used to promote grain exports. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the US by allowing exporters to compete effectively with Canadian grain producers, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to counteract transportation subsidies by the Government of Canada for grain sales to Mexico and the Canadian Wheat Board selling wheat below acquisition cost in foreign markets. These requirements will apply until an agreement is reached to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates under the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988. The Government of Canada will be required to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates and ensure that the Canadian Wheat Board sells wheat at a price no less than the full acquisition cost. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Title XV of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is amended to include a new subtitle called \"Agricultural Export Program Protection\" with defined terms. The term 'agricultural trade program' refers to various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, excluding specific programs under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The term 'covered foreign commodity' refers to wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US from a foreign country. 'Entry' means the importation or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption in the US. The term 'person' includes exporters, assignees, and participants in agricultural trade programs. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning as defined in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. Monitoring of domestic uses of certain foreign commodities. SEC. 1582 requires an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and quarterly reports from consignees certifying usage percentages. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required under SEC. 1582 must contain necessary information as determined by the Secretary to verify the usage of covered foreign commodities by consignees. The Secretary shall require end-use certificates and quarterly reports to contain specific information such as importer and consignee details, country of origin, description and purpose of the commodity. The Secretary requires end-use certificates and quarterly reports to include details such as importer, consignee, country of origin, description, purpose, and transporter information for covered foreign commodities. The quarterly report must also include information on end-use certificates held by the consignee and the quantity of each commodity covered by the certificates. The consignee must provide a quarterly report including details on certificates held, quantity of foreign commodities used, usage details, quantity exported, commingling with US commodities, and disposition of commingled commodities. The importer or first consignee of a covered foreign commodity must provide a quarterly report including details on commingling with US commodities, transfer to subsequent consignees, and changes in end-use. The Secretary may also require reporting of sales price for enforcement of trade laws and agreements. The Secretary may adjust the sales price of covered foreign commodities to enforce trade laws and agreements. Confidentiality measures are in place to protect purchasers. Entry of covered foreign commodities requires a compliant end-use certificate. Penalties apply for non-compliance with customs requirements. The Secretary may adjust sales prices of foreign commodities to enforce trade laws. End-use certificates are required for entry, with penalties for non-compliance. Regulations will be prescribed for implementation, including quarterly report submissions. The compliance provisions of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs authorized under this subtitle. Additionally, there are provisions for suspension or debarment for the use of foreign agricultural commodities in certain agricultural trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from an agricultural trade program for misusing foreign agricultural commodities. The Corporation can waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the misuse was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. The Commodity Credit Corporation can waive suspension or debarment for misusing foreign agricultural commodities if it was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. This section and its amendment will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The Commodity Credit Corporation can waive suspension or debarment for unintentional misuse of foreign agricultural commodities if quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total."
