    "content": "The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit by eliminating the existing credit and inserting a new section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit under section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code. The credit allows for $3,000 for qualifying children over 6 years old and 120% of that amount for children under 6 years old. The credit is subject to reduction based on income levels. The Child Tax Credit under the \"American Family Act of 2017\" is subject to reduction based on income levels. The credit amount is reduced for each $1,000 by which the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount, which is $110,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for individuals. The term 'threshold amount' refers to specific income levels for different filing statuses. The 'applicable amount' is calculated based on the credit allowable without this provision. The term 'qualifying child' refers to a child under 19 years of age who meets certain criteria, excluding certain non-citizens. The credit amount is determined by dividing the credit allowable by $20 multiplied by the total number of qualifying children. The term 'qualifying child' excludes individuals who would not be dependents without considering residency in the US. Inflation adjustment increases the $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) for taxable years after 2017 based on the cost of living adjustment. If the increase is not a multiple of $50, it is rounded. The Child Tax Credit requires taxpayers to include the name and taxpayer identification number of qualifying children on their tax return. The identification number must be issued before the due date of the return. If the increase in the credit amount is not a multiple of $50, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The taxpayer identification number must be issued before the due date for filing the return to qualify for the Child Tax Credit. No credit is allowed if the identification number is issued after the due date. Additionally, the taxable year must be a full 12 months, except in cases of a taxpayer's death. Taxpayers who improperly claimed credit in a prior year are not eligible for the credit during the disallowance period. No credit allowed for fraudulent or reckless claims in prior years under this section. Disallowance period is 10 taxable years after final determination of fraud, and 2 taxable years after final determination of reckless claim. Taxpayers who make improper claims for credit under this section will not be allowed to claim the credit for subsequent years unless they provide necessary information to prove eligibility. Taxpayers must provide required information to prove eligibility for the credit in subsequent years. The credit allowed for a taxable year will be reduced by any advance payments received. Excess advance payments will result in an increase in the tax imposed for that year. The tax imposed for a taxable year will be increased by any excess advance payments received. SEC. 7527A.

The program will also make efforts to apply the limitation of section 36C(b) to the payments made.
