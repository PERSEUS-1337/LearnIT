    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15 each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements before approving them. Any capital investment for plant expansion must be justified by expected returns and serve community interests. Property claiming exemption must be used for exempt activity and not exceed necessary amount. Assessor can audit to verify compliance with requirements. Assessor can deny welfare exemption claim even with organizational clearance certificate. The assessor has the authority to deny a claim for the welfare exemption on a property, even if the claimant has an organizational clearance certificate. If the assessor determines that the property is ineligible for the exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing and can seek a refund of property taxes by filing a claim with the county or file a refund action in superior court if the claim is denied. If the claimant's refund claim with the county is denied, they may file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption and owning exempted property is not required to reapply in subsequent years if there is no change in ownership or use by a governmental entity or nonprofit corporation. The applicant must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible for the exemption or if the property no longer meets the requirements. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption. Applicants must reaffirm eligibility for the welfare exemption for the next fiscal year to maintain exemption status. Failure to do so may prompt the assessor to verify exempt activity. If a welfare or veterans' organization exemption is found to be incorrectly granted, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel the exemption if necessary. Any incorrectly allowed exemption will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Counties can request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by applying in writing to the board by November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. Every application for relief must include the necessary information and be filed with the assessor. The board will provide notice and a hearing upon receiving a timely application. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being barred from relief. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code states that any excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund, after satisfying certain distributions, can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. If not claimed within a specified period, the excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund after deducting certain costs."
