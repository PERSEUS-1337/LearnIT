    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed repealing the CPP, a rule aimed at limiting CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around its legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The rule set national CO2 emission rates for power plants under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d), with state-specific compliance options. The EPA set national CO2 emission rates for power plants under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d), giving states two compliance choices: a \"rate-based\" approach or a \"mass-based\" approach. States had flexibility in how to achieve the standards while minimizing costs or meeting other objectives. The emission reductions achieved would depend on how states chose to comply with the rule and other factors. EPA provided a regulatory analysis of the CPP in 2015. The EPA provided a regulatory analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2015, projecting a 32% reduction in total power sector CO2 emissions by 2030. The proposed repeal of the CPP is a significant change from the previous Administration's stance, based on a new interpretation of the EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA determined that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) exceeds legal authority under the Clean Air Act by setting CO2 emission goals for existing power plants that are difficult to achieve. The agency also conducted a benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal, revealing methodological changes from the 2015 analysis. The benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal by the EPA reveals methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, which may impact how benefits and costs of other regulations are estimated. Members of Congress, including a group of 19 Senators, have shown interest in understanding these changes, particularly in comparison to the 2015 analysis for the final CPP rule. Some of the changes in EPA's 2017 analysis could set a precedent for how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits. The EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP includes methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, potentially impacting how benefits and costs of regulations are estimated. This could set a precedent for federal agencies in considering climate and human health benefits. The section provides background on regulatory analysis requirements for executive branch agencies, an overview of EPA's 2015 and 2017 analyses, and compares their benefit-cost conclusions. It describes three primary changes in the 2017 analysis related to climate benefits, human health co-benefits, and energy savings impact. For more details on EPA's rationale for the proposed repeal, refer to CRS Report R44992, and for legal aspects, see CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10016. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions like the CPP in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12866. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12866. E.O. 12866 directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines significant regulatory actions as rules that meet specific criteria, such as having an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. These rules are required to undergo a detailed regulatory analysis, as outlined in OMB Circular A-4, which provides guidance on developing a good regulatory analysis. E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 outline principles and requirements for regulatory analysis, emphasizing the need to assess benefits and costs of proposed regulatory actions. Circular A-4 aims to standardize measurement and reporting practices across federal agencies, informing whether the benefits of an action justify the costs. Monetized benefits do not necessarily need to outweigh costs, but the analysis should consider whether the benefits are likely to justify the costs. Circular A-4 emphasizes the need to assess whether the benefits of an action justify the costs, without requiring monetized benefits to outweigh costs. It directs agencies to quantify benefits and costs of regulations whenever possible, while also considering non-quantified impacts that are important for regulatory decisions. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015 in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and agency guidelines. When the EPA promulgated the CPP in 2015, it prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and agency guidelines. The analysis included state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario. EPA emphasized that the impacts estimated under the scenarios were not definitive but represented their best assessment of likely impacts of the CPP. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under two scenarios for the CPP using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs included capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring costs. EPA's analysis was not definitive but represented their best assessment of likely impacts of the CPP. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan, including operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, and energy efficiency measures. The plan aimed to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the EPA using the IPM model to estimate reductions and the social cost of carbon to assess climate benefits. This cost estimate also factored in changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. The EPA estimated the human health benefits of reductions from non-GHG emissions in the Clean Power Plan, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. They quantified reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions and monetized the benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. EPA calculated average benefit-per-ton estimates in three different regions. The EPA calculated average benefit-per-ton estimates for reductions in PM and ozone in different regions for the Clean Power Plan analysis. The estimates represented the value of reducing premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to these pollutants, with most of the health co-benefits coming from reductions in premature deaths related to PM exposure, particularly from SO2 emission reductions. The EPA estimated health co-benefits from reducing PM and ozone pollution, with a significant portion coming from SO2 emission reductions. The Trump Administration proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan two years after its finalization under the Obama Administration, following the same rulemaking process mandated by the Clean Air Act Section 307(d). The EPA followed the same rulemaking process to repeal the Clean Power Plan, as mandated by the Clean Air Act Section 307(d). The regulatory analysis for the repeal included summarizing data and specifying methodology. The benefits of repealing a rule include avoiding costs that would have been incurred through implementation. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed CPP repeal, defining benefits as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone emissions reductions and climate/health benefits. EPA used existing power sector projections to estimate benefits and costs of the repeal. The EPA used existing power sector projections to estimate the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal, including forgone emissions reductions and climate/health benefits. The agency plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The EPA used power sector projections to estimate the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal, including forgone emissions reductions and climate/health benefits. They also changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from energy efficiency measures, counting them as a positive benefit of the CPP. In 2017, EPA moved energy efficiency savings from negative to positive benefits in the analysis of the CPP repeal. The 2015 analysis showed net benefits outweighing costs, but the 2017 analysis presented less favorable benefit-cost comparisons. Net benefits occur when benefits exceed costs, while net costs occur when costs exceed benefits. The 2015 analysis showed net benefits outweighing costs, while the 2017 analysis presented varying benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP. The estimates ranged from net costs to net benefits in 2030, with the 2017 analysis not explicitly stating the agency's view on whether the benefits of the repeal will outweigh the costs. The benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2017 showed a range of net costs and net benefits, with half of the comparisons showing net benefits and the other half showing net costs. The estimates for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits, but the effect of updated power sector projections on these estimates is unclear. EPA noted that the agency's view on whether the benefits of the repeal will outweigh the costs is not explicitly stated. The AEO-based estimates of the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. EPA noted that the benefit-cost estimates did not reflect changes in the power sector, such as shifts to lower-emitting sources and changes in regulations. The AEO 2017 projections indicate a shift towards lower-emitting sources, potentially reducing CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the proposed repeal. AEO 2017 also suggests greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. The AEO 2017 projections show a shift towards lower-emitting sources, potentially reducing CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP. One recent study by Resources for the Future analyzed the AEO 2017 projections and found greater reductions in coal emissions compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs in three primary ways, including excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions in SCC estimates and assuming no human health co-benefits below certain pollution thresholds. The EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes led to different conclusions in the 2017 analysis compared to the 2015 analysis. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is used to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions, representing the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions in a given year. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is used by federal agencies to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions from rulemakings. The SCC estimates the monetary value of impacts from changes in CO2 emissions, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. SCC values are calculated using models to estimate the monetary value of associated climate benefits. EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP in 2015 using SCC values developed by an interagency working group. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using four SCC values developed by an interagency working group. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 as part of a broader executive order. E.O. 13783 directed federal agencies to review federal requirements for domestic energy development and consider climate change impacts in regulatory analysis. EPA developed new SCC values based on this directive, using Circular A-4 guidance for domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. The SCC values were labeled as \"interim values\" and differed from the IWG's values in scope and discount rates. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using domestic models and assumptions. The domestic SCC estimates from three models are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA adjusted global values to domestic values using an approximation method. The DICE 2010 model author's paper presents interim domestic SCC estimates of $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. Stakeholders have debated whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values due to the global impact of GHG emissions. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on domestic models and assumptions. The IWG recommended using global values for the social cost of carbon (SCC) due to the global impact of greenhouse gas emissions. EPA agreed with this in 2015, stating that the United States operates in a global economy with potential spillover effects in national security, trade, and public health. Some stakeholders supported using global SCC estimates, arguing that a domestic SCC would underestimate benefits to the U.S. economy. Others noted that U.S. emissions cause most of their damages outside U.S. borders. Some stakeholders recommended using global values for the social cost of carbon (SCC) due to spillover effects on the U.S. economy. Others argued for domestic SCC estimates, citing OMB Circular A-4 guidance and questioning the impact on international climate efforts. Some stakeholders recommended using global values for the social cost of carbon (SCC) due to spillover effects on the U.S. economy. Others argued for domestic SCC estimates, citing OMB Circular A-4 guidance and questioning the impact on international climate efforts. Critics noted that using a global SCC may overstate benefits in a country-specific context, as it includes benefits accruing to non-U.S. populations. EPA's focus on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal was explained by direction in E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4, although Circular A-4 does not prohibit consideration of global values. Circular A-4 allows for consideration of global values in the analysis of benefits and costs, but emphasizes focusing on benefits and costs that affect U.S. citizens and residents. EPA included global estimates in a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, without comparing them to the avoided costs of the proposed repeal. Developing accurate estimates of the domestic SCC poses challenges, as noted by experts and EPA in the 2017 analysis, particularly in capturing relevant regional interactions. The EPA and National Academies of Sciences acknowledge challenges in estimating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) due to difficulties in capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 provides discount rate recommendations based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation involves discounting future impacts based on consumer spending or private capital scenarios. The 3% consumption rate reflects the average saver's discount rate, while the 7% rate represents the opportunity cost of capital. Models estimate climate change impacts up to 2100 and beyond, then discount the future value of those impacts. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation involves discounting future impacts to allow for comparisons of economic impacts occurring at different times. Selecting a discount rate is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change, as the current generation must choose a rate on behalf of future generations without their input. The current generation must choose a discount rate for future generations without their input, raising questions about accounting for future preferences. Different discount rates affect present values, with higher rates resulting in lower values. SCC estimates are sensitive to discount rate selection, and ethical implications are acknowledged in OMB Circular A-4. Sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates is recommended. The OMB Circular A-4 acknowledges ethical implications in comparing benefits and costs across generations. It recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates, as estimates in the 1990s ranged from 1% to 3%. The Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama Administration suggested reducing the 3% discount rate to at most 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental and public interest groups emphasizing intergenerational considerations. Stakeholders have divergent views on discount rate selection for the SCC. Environmental and public interest groups recommend lower rates or rates that decline over time, while industry groups prefer higher rates like 7%. The majority of climate change impact studies use discount rates of no more than 5%. The IWG in 2010 suggested the SCC discount rate should reflect the average saver's consumption rate, not the 7% rate based on opportunity cost. In 2010, the IWG recommended discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% for the SCC, diverging from the 7% rate based on the opportunity cost of capital. The EPA supported these rates in the 2015 CPP analysis, citing consistency with economic literature and OMB guidance. Academics and the NAS have proposed alternative methods for calculating discount rates, emphasizing the need for a new approach to capture uncertainty over long time horizons. The NAS recommended a new approach for calculating discount rates to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time, diverging from the OMB Circular A-4 guidance. EPA estimated lower climate benefits in the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, with lower values applied in the 2017 analysis. The use of a 7% rate and domestic perspective reduced SCC estimates and climate benefit estimates. EPA's 2017 analysis valued CO2 emissions lower than in 2015, leading to reduced estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. The agency acknowledged limitations in the interim SCC estimates and conducted a sensitivity analysis with global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The 2017 analysis also excluded a direct comparison of sensitivity analysis estimates to avoided compliance costs. The EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding human health co-benefits in some benefit-cost comparisons. Different comparisons either counted all health co-benefits, excluded them entirely, or used a threshold to reduce them, which was inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. The EPA's 2017 analysis excluded some health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, focusing on the \"targeted pollutant\" CO2. This approach was seen as inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance, but EPA defended it as a way to evaluate regulatory actions more cost-effectively. Public comments were requested on this new approach. The EPA requested public comment on the consideration of benefits versus costs in decision-making processes, specifically regarding co-benefits from reduced exposure to PM in regulations targeting pollutants. Stakeholders raised concerns about potential double counting of benefits in EPA's 2015 analysis, questioning the attribution of PM benefits to the CPP. EPA clarified that the estimated human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations. The EPA's 2015 analysis stated that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations, and OMB Circular A-4 directs agencies to quantify and monetize co-benefits in benefit-cost analysis. EPA's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses recommend including intended effects, costs, and ancillary benefits in economic analysis. Analyses recommend that the agency's economic analysis should include intended effects, costs, ancillary benefits, and costs. OMB reports that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, with the majority of benefits attributed to reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. This approach is in line with standard accounting practices and OMB Circular A-4 requirements. EPA's benefit-cost comparisons have included some forgone health co-benefits, applying a threshold to count only those exceeding a defined value. The EPA's benefit-cost comparisons included some forgone health co-benefits, applying a threshold to count only those exceeding a defined value under OMB Circular A-4. EPA used thresholds based on federal air quality standards for PM levels to calculate mortality impacts in the 2017 analysis. The EPA used federal air quality standards for PM levels to set thresholds for mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons. The PM air quality standard served as a higher threshold, lowering forgone co-benefit estimates more than the LML threshold. This had implications for the benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal, which mostly favored the repeal. The EPA used PM air quality standard and LML thresholds for mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. Comparisons were mostly favorable to the repeal using the PM threshold and less favorable using the LML threshold. EPA justified the use of these thresholds to enhance transparency and address uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks. EPA justified using PM air quality standard and LML thresholds to address uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks. Scientific evidence provides no clear dividing line for setting a threshold, with studies favoring a no-threshold model for PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower PM concentrations. EPA's 2015 analysis found that a no-threshold model best represents the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship, acknowledging lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower PM concentrations. EPA's 2017 analysis sought feedback on estimating and reporting PM impacts and outlined plans for further research. EPA's 2017 analysis plans to evaluate the uncertainty of the benefit-per-ton approach for estimating health impacts of pollutants like PM. They also changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit. EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis of PM benefits. In 2015, savings were treated as a negative cost, reducing compliance cost estimates. In 2017, savings were treated as a benefit, following OMB guidance. This shift increased both estimated costs and benefits by the same amount. In the proposed repeal analysis, EPA removed energy savings from total cost estimates, resulting in a larger cost estimate, and added them to estimated benefits, resulting in a larger benefits estimate. In the proposed repeal analysis, EPA changed the accounting treatment of energy savings, moving them from cost savings to benefits. This resulted in higher estimates of both costs and benefits, without altering the net impact of the repeal. EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 also reflected this change, keeping it separate from benefit-cost comparisons. EPA conducted an analysis under E.O. 13771, focusing on cost savings of the proposed repeal without considering the forgone benefits. The analysis calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033, excluding demand-side energy efficiency savings. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 focused on cost savings of the proposed repeal without considering demand-side energy efficiency savings. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options, but does not solely determine decisions. When making regulatory decisions, benefit-cost comparisons do not solely determine the outcome. Qualitative impacts, legal considerations, technical feasibility, and ethical factors also play a role. The EPA's proposed repeal of the CPP was based on a legal interpretation change and adherence to rulemaking procedures. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of regulations can be complex and involve scientific data and ethical decisions. The EPA's analysis of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal shows how changes in policy priorities and technical information can impact the estimation of benefits and costs. The 2017 benefit-cost analysis reached different conclusions than the 2015 analysis due to new SCC estimates and thresholds that affected climate and human health benefit estimates. Members of Congress have differing views on EPA regulations. The EPA's analysis of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal highlighted changes in policy priorities and technical information impacting benefit and cost estimations. The 2017 analysis differed from the 2015 analysis due to new SCC estimates and thresholds affecting climate and human health benefits. Congress has varying views on EPA regulations, with potential impacts on major industries and the health of U.S. citizens. The changes in EPA's assessment of the CPP between the Trump and Obama Administrations reflect differences in policy priorities. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. The 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates that differed from the IWG's methodology, resulting in lower estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to consider the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates in valuing GHG impacts. The 7% rate reduction in interim SCC estimates lowered estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to address potential differences in GHG-related regulations across federal agencies due to the withdrawal of IWG SCC estimates. EPA's 2017 analysis lacked details on future SCC steps and implications for federal analyses. It remains uncertain if other agencies will adopt the same interim estimates for regulatory analyses. The EPA's changes to the health co-benefits analysis may set a precedent for future air pollution rulemakings. The 2017 analysis reflected different policy determinations than the 2015 analysis, with uncertainties in benefits. Other agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have followed a similar approach as the EPA, while the Department of Energy continued to use the IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking. Congress may need to address potential differences in GHG-related regulations across federal agencies. The EPA's 2017 analysis on human health co-benefits in air pollution rulemakings differed from the 2015 analysis, with a focus on PM mortality impacts and the exclusion of health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons. This departure from previous analyses and federal guidance may have implications for future regulations."
