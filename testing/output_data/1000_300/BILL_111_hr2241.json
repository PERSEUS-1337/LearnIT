The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez were also kidnapped and tortured. Many US citizens detained by Iraq were beaten, treated inhumanely, and used as \"human shields.\" During the Gulf War, American citizens were detained by Iraq, subjected to cruel treatment, and used as \"human shields\" to prevent military intervention. The Department of State classified Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism at that time. American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical and emotional damage from this state-sponsored torture. Upon their return, they were welcomed as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. During the Gulf War, American POWs were welcomed home as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's treatment of captured US service members and amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to hold Iraq accountable for torture of American POWs. In 1996, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow torture victims like Gulf War POWs to seek compensation from terrorist countries, including Iraq. On April 4, 2002, 17 Gulf War POWs filed claims in the United States District Court for damages related to their torture by the Government of Iraq.

In 2003, 17 Gulf War POWs filed claims in the United States District Court for damages related to their torture by the Government of Iraq. The group included military personnel from various branches such as USMC, USAF, U.S. Army, and USN. Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Tice, Lieutenant Robert Wetzel, and Commander Jeffrey Zaun were among the former POWs seeking justice for their repeated torture. Despite a judge awarding them damages for deterrence of torture, they have not received payment due to a waiver granted for Iraq by the President in 2008. In December 2001, the United States district court held Iraq liable for taking hostages after the invasion of Kuwait, awarding damages to former hostages and their spouses. In March 2003, the President directed payment of these judgments from blocked Iraqi accounts. The President of the United States directed the payment of judgments in Hill v. Republic of Iraq from blocked Iraqi accounts and issued an Executive order to confiscate all remaining blocked assets for Iraq reconstruction. More than 200 US citizens held hostage in Iraq are awaiting compensation in Vine v. Republic of Iraq. They are unable to enforce any judgment due to a waiver. The plaintiffs in Vine v. Republic of Iraq have not been compensated and cannot enforce any judgment in US courts due to a waiver granted for Iraq. Article 131 of the Third Geneva Convention prohibits the US from absolving Iraq of liability for torture of prisoners of war. The US has a moral obligation to protect its citizens from torture and hostage-taking. The United States has a moral obligation to protect its Armed Forces and citizens from torture and hostage-taking.

Payment may also include an additional $6,000 for each day the person was held as a hostage, and one-third of the amount for spouses or children of qualifying individuals. Additionally, individuals with prior judgments for compensatory damages may receive payment for the unsatisfied amount. Compensatory damages in a case involving hostage taking include payment of the unsatisfied judgment amount, capped at $1,000,000 or the award amount, and one-third of any excess over $1,000,000.

Section 1083(c) of the same Act applies to cases specified in subsection (b)(2) regardless of any waiver for Iraq."
