    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% pay adjustment under H.R. 2673, signed into law by President George Bush. The House of Representatives and the Senate agreed to the conference report accompanying H.R.2673 in December 2003 and January 2004, respectively. President Bush signed the bill into law on January 23, 2004, providing a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated the pay adjustment as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments and net pay increases for federal white-collar employees. Federal white-collar employees receive annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. The Act has not been fully implemented as originally enacted, with some years seeing reduced pay adjustments. In January 2003, employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1%. Federal white-collar employees received reduced locality payments in 1995-2004. In January 2003, they had a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. In January 2004, they also received a 4.1% adjustment. The report focuses on the 2004 adjustments and does not include salary changes for federal officials, judges, or Members of Congress. In January 2004, federal employees under various schedules received an annual pay adjustment based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment is determined by private sector wages and salaries, with basic pay rates increasing by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI. Adjustments for contract appeals board members are tied to Executive Schedule pay adjustments. The pay adjustment for federal employees in January 2004 is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with basic pay rates increasing by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI. The ECI shows an annual pay adjustment of 2.7%, reflecting the change in private sector wages and salaries. FEPCA allows the President to issue an alternative plan in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. FEPCA allows the President to issue an alternative plan for federal employee pay adjustments in case of national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, with the possibility of extension to other positions for a locality pay adjustment in 2004. In 2004, locality pay adjustments were extended to employees in various positions, including those in the Foreign Service and senior-level roles. The Pay Agent determined pay cap levels for non-General Schedule employees receiving locality pay. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System received a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average percentage pay increase for white-collar employees, with exceptions for certain locations. In 2004, blue-collar workers in certain locations were guaranteed a pay adjustment no less than GS employees. Special rate employees receive the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers get both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The locality-based comparability payments procedure ensures payments in areas with a non-federal/federal pay disparity over 5%. The locality-based comparability payments procedure, established by FEPCA, aims to equalize pay rates for GS employees with non-federal workers in the same locality. The President can adjust these payments in case of a national emergency or economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to provide a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, which was implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in each pay area, with 32 pay areas nationwide. The surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in 32 pay areas nationwide are conducted under the National Compensation Survey program. Survey results are submitted to OPM for comparison of federal and non-federal salaries by grade to determine the pay gap in each area. The National Compensation Survey program compares federal and non-federal salaries by grade in 32 pay areas nationwide. The pay gap is adjusted annually to reduce the disparity to 5% as mandated by law. FEPCA requires a certain percentage of the pay gap to be closed each year, with increments of 10% starting from 1994. The locality pay gap has been gradually closing since 1994, with annual increments specified by FEPCA. However, the actual percentage of closure has been lower each year, with the target gap recalculated after each adjustment. By January 2002, FEPCA mandated that pay amounts could not be less than what is necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The locality pay gap has been closing gradually since 1994, with annual increments specified by FEPCA. By January 2002, pay amounts could not be less than the full amount needed to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. Locality payments are based on pay gaps that are 22 months old by the adjustment date, using OCSP and NCS survey data. The Federal Salary Council explained how the pay gaps for January 2004 locality payments were determined using outdated survey data ranging from 1995 to 1996 for various pay areas. The Federal Salary Council reported on the 2004 locality payments, explaining the methodology used to determine pay gaps. The overall gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries in March 2002 was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, an average raise of 25.73% was recommended. The council suggested locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to meet the target for closing the pay gap. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in 2004 to reduce the pay gap, with increases ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% if required payments were granted. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in 2004 to reduce the pay gap, with increases ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% if required payments were granted. The council also recommended including areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS in the surveys for 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended including areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS in the surveys for 2004. The council plans to consider dropping some areas to increase sample size in other locations or add new locality pay surveys. The basic criteria for determining pay areas were established in 1993 and remain unchanged. The Federal Salary Council established criteria in 1993 for determining pay areas, which remain unchanged. The criteria include factors such as county contiguity, a minimum of 2,000 GS employees, and economic linkage with the pay area. An exception was recommended for Barnstable County, MA, which was seeking inclusion in the Boston pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended an exception for Barnstable County, MA to be included in the Boston pay area due to being the only county on the eastern seaboard without a separate locality pay area. The Council voted to make this change in 2004 to address the situation. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address the unique situation of being the only county on the eastern seaboard without a separate locality pay area. Additionally, the council recommended including St. Mary's County, MD in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD pay area for 2004. Santa Barbara County, CA has fallen below the threshold of 2,000 employees required for a criterion. The Federal Salary Council recommended that New London and Santa Barbara remain as areas of application for their respective pay areas in 2004. They also mentioned upcoming changes in locality pay area definitions due to new census data and revisions by the Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau. A major review of the locality pay program is planned for 2003 based on this new information. The Federal Salary Council plans to review the locality pay program in 2003 based on new census data and revisions by the Office of Management and Budget. Monterey County, CA and the State of Rhode Island are recommended to be included in the San Francisco and Boston pay areas, respectively, with adjustments made for Rhode Island's smaller size. The Federal Salary Council recommended adopting \"Full State\" criteria for including Rhode Island in the Boston pay area in 2004. The criteria for an installation to be included in a pay area include having at least 1,000 GS employees, with the majority of employees within 10 miles of the survey boundary area. Edwards Air Force Base was included in the Los Angeles pay area since 1994 but no longer meets the criteria. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Rhode Island in the Boston pay area in 2004 based on \"Full State\" criteria. Edwards Air Force Base was part of the Los Angeles pay area since 1994 but no longer meets the employment criteria. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program in 2001 and provided a progress report in 2004. The council's memorandum to the Pay Agent in 2004 provided a progress report on locality payments. OPM and BLS have made improvements in the evaluation system and survey methods. BLS has developed an econometric model to estimate salaries for non-federal jobs. OPM has worked on matching federal survey jobs with non-federal jobs and creating subcategories for certain occupations. OPM and BLS have improved the matching of federal survey jobs with non-federal jobs and created subcategories for certain occupations. An interagency working group developed a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS used this crosswalk and GS employment weights for data delivery. The approach for supervisory occupations now grades the highest level of work supervised and adjusts the grade level based on the level of supervision. Additional improvements are expected in the crosswalk, with updated GS employment information provided annually. BLS and Pay Agent staff have developed a new approach for grading supervisory jobs based on the level of supervision. The approach involves grading the highest level of work supervised and adding one, two, or three grades based on the level of supervision. BLS has also developed criteria to identify and exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government. The council's report on 2004 locality payments expressed concerns about the reliability of data produced by the NCS. The council's report on the 2004 locality payments recommended the phase-in of NCS data but expressed concerns about its reliability. It suggested that any further implementation of NCS data must be conditioned on BLS implementing improvements and increasing sample sizes in areas with significant pay gaps. Metropolitan areas are defined using OMB definitions for the 32 locality pay areas. The OPM regulations for locality pay areas are based on OMB definitions of metropolitan areas. Changes in OMB definitions no longer automatically affect locality pay areas. OPM advised that revised definitions in 2003 would not immediately impact the GS locality pay program. OPM modified GS locality pay regulations to maintain the metropolitan area portion. The new statistical area definitions will not have an immediate impact on the GS locality pay program. OPM recently adjusted the GS locality pay regulations to align with previous OMB statistical area definitions. This allows for a review of the new definitions by the Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent before any decisions are made in 2003. Some major changes include the elimination of the 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' concept used in defining locality pay areas. The locality pay program has undergone changes in area definitions, with the introduction of new concepts like 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas'. Population density is no longer a criterion, and commuting thresholds have been adjusted. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended considering the new definitions for the program. At two public council meetings in September and October 2003, the working group recommended considering new MSA definitions for the locality pay program. The group suggested additional study before making any decisions, as using the new definitions could impact 83 counties in existing metropolitan areas and exclude 10 counties. The working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, which would impact existing metropolitan areas and exclude 10 counties. They also suggested using Combined Statistical Areas for pay adjustments and folding three pay areas with gaps below RUS into RUS for cost savings. The working group recommended revising area definitions for locality pay, including expanding coverage to more communities and folding three pay areas with gaps below RUS into RUS for cost savings. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved for the January 2005 pay adjustments, with proposed changes to be published in the Federal Register for public comment. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was passed by the House of Representatives in September 2003. The Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004, offered by Representative Sam Farr was agreed to by voice vote by the House of Representatives on September 4, 2003. An amendment at Section 742 states that none of the funds in the bill could be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Farr testified about the potential reduction in pay for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Jack Reed offered a similar amendment. Senator Jack Reed offered an amendment (S.Amdt. 1944) during a meeting on September 3, 2003, regarding the reduction in pay for federal employees in Monterey County, California. The amendment, agreed to by the Senate, stated that no funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The amendment by Senator Jack Reed, incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, prevented the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This provision was enacted as Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report to the President on the 2004 locality payments on December 5, 2002, recommending adjustments for January 2004. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004 in its annual report to the President, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they advised against implementing the locality pay increases. They expressed concerns about the current compensation process for Federal employees. The Pay Agent expressed concerns about the compensation process for Federal employees, particularly regarding the single percentage adjustment in pay without considering differing labor markets or individual performance. The cost of January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion to reduce the pay disparity, according to the Pay Agent's report. The recommended locality payments for January 2004 were included in Table 1, with the Pay Agent not adopting the council's recommendation for Barnstable County, Massachusetts to be part of the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts in the Boston locality pay area for January 2004 payments. The Pay Agent stated that improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, focusing on issues with job selection and GS grades. Improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, focusing on job selection and GS grades above GS-15. The Pay Agent looks forward to reviewing NCS data next year and encouraged expedited completion of remaining improvements. Pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic GS schedule by annual adjustment percentage and locality payment. Pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic GS schedule with annual adjustment percentage and locality payment. President George W. Bush issued the FY2004 budget proposing a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, with the statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2004 being 2.7%. Any changes to these rates require submission of an alternative plan to Congress by September 1, 2003. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, proposing a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% for annual and 0.5% for locality pay. The cost of the adjustment was estimated at $2 billion, compared to $13 billion required by FEPCA. Executive Order 13322 was issued to implement these adjustments. The President's alternative plan proposed a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, costing about $2 billion. Executive Order 13322 implemented the plan, which also included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, with funding contingent upon enactment of legislation authorizing the fund within OPM. No funds would be available until OPM Director notifies relevant subcommittees of approval of a performance pay plan for an agency. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund, stating that such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate. Funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the fund, with the condition that OPM director approves an agency's performance pay plan before funds can be transferred. The OPM director must approve an agency's performance pay plan before funds can be transferred to federal agencies for the Human Capital Performance Fund. The President's alternative plan suggested that agencies may have to freeze hiring to cover the cost of pay raises above 2%. Federal employee union representatives expressed disappointment with the 2.0% pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades, allowing managers to set pay based on competence and performance. Other agencies may adopt different systems. Pay banding systems are currently being considered. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system in favor of broad-band systems with wider salary ranges. Pay banding systems are being implemented at various agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. Pay parity provisions allowing salary increases for certain employees are included in recent legislation. New human resources management systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense are also authorized in recent acts. New HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense were authorized in recent acts. Changes to pay setting systems are expected to include broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, which may differ from the President's recommendations. In 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Resolutions in 2003 aimed for parity between military and civilian pay increases, expressing nonbinding opinions. Members of Congress from the Washington, DC area wrote letters to President Bush and Representatives regarding the issue. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The House of Representatives passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004. Members of Congress urged support for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The House Committee on the Budget report accompanying the bill recommended adjusting civilian federal pay in proportion to military pay raises. The Senate version of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget included the same language as the House. The Concurrent Budget Resolution sets the framework for Congress to consider spending legislation. Congressional recommendations on civilian federal pay adjustments are typically included in appropriations bills. The House Committee on the Budget report recommended adjusting civilian federal pay in proportion to military pay raises. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004, proposed a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill did not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The House Committee on the Budget report recommended a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill did not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies approved the bill for consideration by the full committee, and the House Committee on Appropriations ordered it to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives. Representative Steny Hoyer, along with Representatives James Moran and Frank Wolf, offered an amendment for the pay adjustment. H.R. 2989 was reported to the House by the House Appropriations Committee on July 30, 2003. Section 740(a) includes the pay adjustment language. Section 602 would ensure that the pay increase is absorbed within the appropriated levels. H.R. 2989 was reported to the House by the House Appropriations Committee on July 30, 2003. The bill included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, which was opposed by the Bush Administration. They proposed a 2.0% pay raise instead, citing the current economic conditions. The Administration proposed a 2.0% pay raise for civilian employees, with a Human Capital Performance Fund for high-performing federal employees. Concerns were raised about unfunded civilian pay increases costing DOD $660 million. The Administration expressed disappointment that the bill did not fund the $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2989 expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. It notes that the 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases, but does not address Federal employee turnover concerns. Federal employees are generally satisfied with their pay, with a low quit rate of 1.7% per year. The 'quit rate' among Federal employees is at an all-time low of 1.7% per year, well below the private sector average. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in certain departments may limit flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. S. 1589, the Senate version of the appropriations bill, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment approved by the full committee. The Senate approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The pay increase would be absorbed within the levels appropriated in the act or previous appropriations acts. The Senate approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The pay increase would be absorbed within the levels appropriated in the act or previous appropriations acts. The amendment also included a recommendation for a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. The pay adjustment in the Washington, DC, area was 4.42%, slightly higher than the initial projection of 4.41%. H.R. 2989 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004. Funding for the pay raises had to be within appropriated levels, and OPM was directed to consider implementing the Federal Salary Council's recommendation. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 on January 23, 2004, which became P.L. 108-199, providing a 2.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The pay provisions are at Section 640(a) and Section 502 of the law. Additionally, OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 the next day, with a total cost of about $4.1 billion for the 4.1% pay adjustment. Executive Order 13332 allocated a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, costing about $4.1 billion. OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 the next day. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address the federal white-collar pay-setting system. Congress could examine ways to amend FEPCA, which aims to reduce the pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. However, as of 2004, the average pay gap is 25.73%, far from the target. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent report that only a small percentage of the target pay gaps have been closed each year, leading to the significant disparity in salaries. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Concerns were raised about the completeness of data, credibility of gaps, and the single percentage adjustment for all jobs in a locality. Despite these concerns, no proposals were made to change FEPCA. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys documenting non-federal rates of pay were not approved for use in determining pay adjustments for several years. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Concerns were raised about the completeness of data and credibility gaps. Despite these concerns, no proposals were made to change FEPCA. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys documenting non-federal rates of pay were not approved for use in determining pay adjustments for several years. In P.L. 106-554, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on the methodological concerns, which were reiterated in a report to Congress on May 15, 2001. Improvements to the survey methodology are underway. The Pay Agent reported methodological concerns to Congress in May 2001 and improvements to the survey methodology are in progress. A white paper on compensation was issued by the Office of Personnel Management in April 2002, highlighting the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in November 2002 compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees, showing that federal employees in certain occupations tended to earn less than their private sector counterparts. The comparison between federal employees in different occupations showed that those in professional and administrative roles tended to earn less than their private sector counterparts, with about 85% lagging behind by more than 20%. In contrast, around 30% of federal employees in technical and clerical positions had salaries higher than those in private firms. Overall, technical and clerical jobs had smaller pay differences, with about three-quarters of federal employees in these roles earning salaries within 10% of private sector levels. The CBO found that the federal pay system does not allow for variation in pay raises by occupation, leading to potential disparities where employees in professional and administrative roles may receive smaller raises than needed to match private sector salaries, while those in technical and clerical positions may receive higher raises than necessary. This indicates that even if the current system was fully implemented as intended, it would still fail to provide federal pay comparable to nonfederal jobs. The current federal pay system, if fully implemented as intended, would still fail to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs. Granting the same percentage raise to all workers can result in above-market salaries for some and below-market salaries for others, especially in professional and administrative occupations which have seen an increase in federal employment. The estimated cost of fully implementing the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) is a concern, with the Pay Agent estimating a cost of $8.830 billion for locality-based comparability payments in January 2004. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the uniformed military. The unions criticized the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding of FEPCA. AFGE questioned the methodology used by the Department of Labor in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector. Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector has been questioned by AFGE and NTEU. The methodological problems have shifted from the locality component to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) component. This has raised concerns about the accuracy of federal pay adjustments. The President's Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented. President Bush issued Executive Order 13322 for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment. The Executive Orders issued by U.S. President Bush in January and March 2004 provided pay adjustments for federal employees, including a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment in January, and an additional 2.1% pay adjustment in March. The pay rates were calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The new GS schedule for federal employees in 2004 includes annual adjustment percentages and locality payments. The resulting pay rates are compared to 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online at http://www.opm.gov, with definitions for MSA and CMSA areas provided in 5 CFR 531.603(b)."
