    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until FY2011 when funding was eliminated. General Electric and Rolls-Royce announced the end of F136 development on December 2, 2011. In FY2011, Congress terminated funding for the alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine, leading to the termination of the F-35 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the Joint Strike Fighter competition in 2001. The F135 and F136 engines were designed to be interchangeable without modifying the F-35 airframe. The F136 engine, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce for the F-35 fighter, was terminated in FY2011 despite Congress restoring funding in previous years. The alternate engine program was officially ended by the Department of Defense on April 25, 2011. The alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter was terminated in FY2011 by the Department of Defense. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured, leading to cuts in future capabilities and force structure. The F-35 program office anticipates a reduction in procurement of 50 to 80 aircraft over the next five years. Procuring a second engine would raise operation and support costs, especially challenging for aircraft carriers. International interest in the F-35 is already strong due to its capabilities and cost, making a second engine unnecessary. Congress is accustomed to using single designs across fleets. The F-35 program office expects a decrease in aircraft procurement over the next five years. Congress and DOD accept the risk of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants and airframes. Development of the F135 engine has progressed to the point where an alternate engine program is no longer necessary. Fixes for previous test failures have been identified and implemented. The F135 engine experienced technical problems in 2007 and 2008, with fixes being implemented. Opponents argue that terminating the alternate engine program goes against the FY2008 defense authorization act. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the development of two options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter to avoid reliance on a single engine type. This would allow for competition in procurement and support, potentially reducing costs compared to sole-source procurement. Having two F-35 engine options in production would enable competition, reduce costs, improve performance, and allow for quicker production surges in response to strategic changes. It would also maintain competition in future tactical aircraft engine development. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, despite potential benefits such as maintaining competition in engine production and maximizing F-35 exports. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011. All tooling and engines produced under the contract were ordered to be returned. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine on December 2, 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for work related to the F-35 program. The $7.3 billion funding for the F-35 program included $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The F135 SDD contract cost increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion, including $1.7 billion for SDD work on the F136 engine. The F136 engine team received $2.4 billion for System Development and Demonstration work, excluding STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems. The government operated under continuing resolutions until April 15, 2011, with some members of Congress questioning the program's status due to the Administration's opposition to further funding. During a period of continuing resolutions, some members of Congress questioned the status of the alternate engine program due to the Administration's opposition to further funding. The CRs prohibited spending on new starts or procurement rates above FY2010 levels, with DOD spending set at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 budget. Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew stated that DoD would continue funding activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period. In a letter, Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew assured that DoD would fund activities on a pro-rata basis during the CR period, covering only until March 4, 2011. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that the program would cost an additional $2.9 billion over five years, with little advantage to taxpayers. The alternate engine program has been funded at $1.8 billion, with an additional projected cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years. Analysis shows little benefit to taxpayers as most customers will only buy one engine due to limited logistics and space. The F135 engine program is progressing well, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700, while the F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing. The F135 engine program is progressing well, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed concerns about the benefits of investing in a second engine due to development problems and unclear cost savings. The F135 engine program is advancing, with concerns raised about investing in a second engine due to development issues and uncertain cost savings. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz emphasized the technological progress in engine design and production, highlighting the importance of engine reliability for aircraft like the F-35, F-22, and F-18E/F. The F-22 and F-18E/F are single-engine airplanes, with General Schwartz questioning the need for an alternate engine for the F135 due to cost concerns. Adm. Roughead supports the one engine camp for carriers, emphasizing space constraints. Gen. Cartwright suggests investing in more Predators instead of the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright questions the need for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, suggesting investing in more Predators instead. Developing a second engine would require significant upfront costs for infrastructure and maintenance. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter was no longer needed as a hedge against failure, citing high costs and minimal financial benefits from competition. The Office of Management and Budget stated that cancelling the program would result in over a billion dollars in near-term savings. The Office of Management and Budget stated that cancelling the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter would result in over a billion dollars in near-term savings. GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield enough savings to offset the costs of competition over the program's life. They estimated that continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent to recoup that investment. The GAO stated that a competitive strategy for the alternate engine program could result in significant savings across the engine's life cycle, citing the \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s as an example. Nonfinancial benefits such as better performance and increased reliability were also mentioned. Cost has been a major issue in the debate, with proponents of the alternate engine pointing to cost growth in the F135 as evidence for the need for competition. The cost of the F135 engine has increased, leading to debates over the need for a second engine for the program. The Administration argues that the benefits of a second engine do not justify the costs, despite concerns about cost growth. The Administration argues against funding a second engine for the F-35 program due to manageable engine problems and cost concerns. A Joint Assessment Team was created to analyze Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues. The team's charter included understanding production costs and developing a plan for cost and affordability. Adding a second engine would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan. The Defense Department declined to provide access to the Joint Assessment Team results regarding the F135 engine cost and affordability. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as sticking to the single-source plan, supporting the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The potential cost savings from two engines remain uncertain despite reduced development costs for the F136 engine. The memo sent to lawmakers on Feb. 25 acknowledges that development work on the F136 engine has reduced costs, but still concludes that having two competing F-35 engines does not justify the expense. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional F135 engines and improvements, with $400 million allocated for engine enhancements, particularly for the F-35B variant. The DOD allocated approximately $400 million for engine improvements, specifically for the vertical-lift F-35B. A third of the planned improvements are to meet the original propulsion-system specification, while two-thirds aim to exceed the specification and enhance design robustness. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were directed by Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act, resulting in differing conclusions on financial break-even points. The studies conducted by the OSD, IDA, and GAO in 2007 used the same data from the JSF program office and contractors. They had differing conclusions on the financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits of an engine competition were highlighted, including improvements in fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of the industrial base, and stronger international relations. The CAIG study analyzed past cost results of engine competitions for various fighter programs. The CAIG study analyzed past cost results of engine competitions for various fighter programs, including the engine competition for the Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 strike fighter program and the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The study assumed that a second F-35 engine provider would meet the initial provider in pricing in 2014, resulting in a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs and a steeper rate of reduction in cost for producing subsequent engines. The study estimated that an F-35 engine competition would need to achieve a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs. The CAIG study estimated that a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs is needed for an F-35 engine competition to break even. However, on a net-present-value basis, a 25.6% reduction is required. The study suggests that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve the necessary savings by 2040. The CAIG study highlighted the need for competition in engine operations and support contracts to achieve a 25.6% savings by 2040. It also discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating weight growth and the need for increased engine thrust. The CAIG study emphasized the importance of competition in engine operations and support contracts to achieve savings by 2040. It also addressed the potential weight growth in the F-35 engine, requiring increased thrust. The IDA study examined engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating significant savings and investment costs for an alternate engine program for the F-35. The IDA study estimated that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur direct and indirect investment costs of $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. To break even on an NPV basis, the program would require an unrealistic 40% procurement-cost savings, which could decrease to 18% if engine O&S contracts were also competed. DOD has limited historical data on potential O&S savings due to the lack of linking procurement and O&S costs in a single competition. The study highlighted the importance of linking procurement and O&S costs in competitions to estimate potential savings. It emphasized contractor responsiveness as a key factor in the Great Engine War and the need for an alternate engine for F-35 fleet readiness. The GAO study indicated that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be necessary for the alternate engine program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20% from past engine competitions. The GAO study found that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings is needed for the alternate engine program to break even on its investment costs. It also mentioned that past engine competitions have shown savings of up to 20%. The study suggested that savings from competing the engine could recoup the investment costs, with the program expected to reach its break-even point by the late 2020s. Despite marginal financial benefits, the DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the alternate engine program for its non-financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run can impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. The F-35 production run size can affect the break-even point for an alternate engine program. U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on F-35 procurement and engine choices will influence the production run size, which can change over time due to various factors like international security and defense budgets. The F-35 production run size can vary over time due to changes in the international security environment and defense budgets. Offers for building F136 and F135 engines at fixed prices were made by GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney, with agreements reached for F135s to equip F-35s in certain production lots. GE/Rolls-Royce made a fixed-price offer for F135 engines for F-35s in FY2012-FY2014, which was accepted by DOD. The cost of LRIP IV F135s was reported to be 16% lower than LRIP III. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006 outlined the production work for the JSF Air System, including propulsion systems like the F135. The production work for the JSF Air System includes the production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The MOU scope of work includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems subject to the availability of funds. The provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid. The PSFD MOU provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, subject to availability of funds. Consultations with partners have been held regarding the decision not to include F136 in RDT&E funding requests. The JSF SDD and PSFD MOU obligations will continue to be implemented without amendment, regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization and appropriation process. European countries with firms involved in F135 and F136 programs may evolve their position on the second engine based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence wrote to Senator Carl Levin regarding these matters. The British Secretary of State for Defence expressed support for the F136 engine, citing concerns about potential long-term costs if the second engine is canceled. Both F135 and F136 engines faced development challenges, including failures during ground testing due to high-cycle fatigue. The F135 engine experienced failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008 due to high-cycle fatigue, leading to delays in the F-35B aircraft's first flight. These engine malfunctions contributed to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million in the F135 program. Pratt & Whitney attributed damage to an F135 in 2009 to a worn bushing, causing damage to fan blades. In September 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported damage to a second-generation engine due to a worn bushing, leading to damage on fan blades. A minor modification will be made to all initial service release production engines. The F136 engine encountered three incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage on turbine blades. GE initiated a design change after an F136 sustained damage to its fan and compressor in September 2010. In September 2010, an F136 engine sustained damage to its fan and compressor due to a loose nut being ingested. GE made a design change to prevent a recurrence. In April 2011, some F135 engines were replaced with spares after a misassembly issue was identified. Pratt & Whitney confirmed replacements were made for a 'small number' of F135 engines due to misassembly problems. Pratt & Whitney ordered replacements for F135 engines due to misassembly issues identified during ground tests and production. In 2009, quality control deficiencies led to a 24% increase in F135 costs, with Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticizing the scrap and rework rate. Pratt & Whitney defended their yield rates, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate. Pratt & Whitney defended their yield rates, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate, with a 97% total engine scrap rate. General Electric F136 achieved 115% thrust in testing. The decision to continue the alternate engine program is a key issue for Congress. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising the question for Congress whether to continue or end the program. Congressional appropriations for the program have drawn funds from various sources, potentially impacting other DOD programs if funds are reallocated within the existing F-35 budget lines. The source of funds for the alternate engine program may impact other DOD programs, potentially leading to cuts in F-35 activities. Allocating funds within the existing F-35 budget lines could result in reducing the number of F-35s procured or causing delays in the program. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program at the expense of other defense programs. The alternate engine program for the F-35 could force funds from other defense programs. Congress may need to decide if continuing the program will reduce F-35 procurement, cause program delays, or cut other defense capabilities. DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding two F-35 engines would cost the same as one engine due to past appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion is needed over six years to develop the F136 engine for competition. The need for an additional $2.9 billion over six years to develop the F136 engine for competition was highlighted. Different cost aspects are being discussed, including the upfront cost and lifetime cost, with conflicting studies on the potential savings from competition. The F136 engine development cost is a point of contention, with conflicting studies on potential savings from competition. Competition is seen as a way to control cost growth, with Congress needing to decide which assumptions to believe. The risk of a single engine type for the F-35 is debated in comparison to other accepted risks. Contracts for the F-35 program include incentives for meeting cost targets and penalties for missing them. There is a debate on whether having a single engine type for the F-35 poses a greater risk compared to other aircraft fleets. Supporters of a second engine argue that relying on one type of engine could lead to all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues. Engine problems have led to groundings in the past for the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. Terminating the F136 alternate engine program is a point of contention. A faulty engine bearing caused a crash, with engine issues leading to Navy and Air Force groundings in the past. DOD argues that terminating the F136 alternate engine program poses little operational risk due to advancements in airflow prediction and health monitoring software for engines. They believe that relying on a single engine type for aircraft is now less risky. The advanced software for prognostic health monitoring aims to reduce operational risks by allowing engines to diagnose their own condition and provide advanced warning of impending failures. Despite potential cost savings, logistical issues may complicate the use of multiple engines, as highlighted by the Navy's limited facilities. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead and Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz have differing views on the matter. The Chief of Naval Operations and Air Force Chief of Staff have differing views on the use of multiple engines for the F-35. The Air Force has experience with multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets, but concerns remain about logistical issues and the need to focus on one engine for the entire F-35 buy. Congress may need to decide whether to direct multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 program. General Electric, a key U.S. fighter aircraft engine manufacturer, faces potential competition issues if the F136 engine for the F-35 is terminated. The debate centers on whether the Pentagon should pay GE $3 billion to compete with Pratt & Whitney. This decision could impact GE's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engine contracts. General Electric has a significant share of the market for commercial aircraft engines and military engines. A study noted that GE produced 1,000 commercial engines in 2007, while Pratt & Whitney produced 220. GE derives about 15% of its business from military engines, compared to Pratt & Whitney's 50%. The key question is how GE's work on engines other than the F136 would impact its ability to design and produce fighter engines. General Electric's significant share of the market for commercial and military engines raises questions about its ability to design and produce fighter engines if the F136 program is terminated. A study highlighted potential challenges in transferring military jet engineers' skills to commercial engines, impacting GE's competitiveness for future military engine contracts. Ending the F136 program could also reduce suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines for F-35 production could mitigate these risks. The potential termination of the F136 program could impact the F-35 engine spare parts supply chain and create uncertainty for suppliers. Multiple vendors could produce parts for each engine, but a study suggested that the U.S. industrial base may not be irreparably harmed if the F136 engine is terminated. The 2007 IDA study concluded that the U.S. industrial base may not be irreparably harmed if the F136 engine is terminated. It expressed concerns about DOD relying solely on a firm with a weak position in the commercial marketplace for fighter engine production. The study found it unlikely that any supplier would exit the domestic industrial base due to F136 termination, and overall, the U.S. industrial base would be stronger with an active F136 program. The IDA study concluded that the U.S. industrial base would be stronger with an active F136 program, as competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney improved engine development. Congress may consider non-monetary value and financial costs of one or two engines. H.R. 1540 includes language on competitive development and procurement of the F-35's engine. H.R. 1540 includes language barring funds for F-35 engine performance improvements unless competitively developed and procured. DOD must preserve existing F136 engines and allow contractor-funded research and development. The F-35 Lightning II aircraft program prohibits funds for performance improvements to the propulsion system without competitive development and production. Performance improvement is defined as increasing airflow volume or thrust for takeoff performance or vertical load bring back. The asset-preservation language ensures preservation and storage of certain property related to the F136 propulsion system. The asset-preservation language requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system to allow for potential future restart of development. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan to preserve and store property related to the F136 propulsion system for potential future restart of development. This plan includes sustainment, repair, and supplier base costs, as well as allowing contractors to use the property for research and development activities. Additionally, the Secretary must identify any necessary contract modifications, facilities, or funding. No disposal of property is allowed with funds allocated for research and development. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan to preserve property related to the F136 propulsion system for potential future restart of development, including sustainment, repair, and supplier base costs. No disposal of property is allowed with funds allocated for research and development. The Secretary is required to submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 45 days of the enactment of the Act. The report accompanying H.R. 1540 emphasizes incentivizing competition and ensuring preservation of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The committee supports the contractor's efforts to continue development despite program cancellation, believing that competition will lead to better engine performance and operational readiness. The F136 engine is crucial for the Joint Strike Fighter program, with competition expected to improve engine performance, contractor responsiveness, industrial base robustness, engine reliability, and operational readiness. The Administration opposes limiting funds for F-35 propulsion system improvements without competitive development, as some enhancements may be necessary during testing. Developing an extra engine is deemed unnecessary by the Administration and DoD, potentially destabilizing the F-35 program. The Administration opposes the development of an extra engine for the F-35 program, as it is deemed unnecessary and would add significant costs. They also object to a requirement to preserve property from the terminated F136 program, citing it as an unnecessary expense during a period of fiscal restraint. The Senate passed legislation prohibiting funds for the F136 engine development, citing it as unnecessary and costly. This new requirement would involve storing over 250,000 pieces of government property from the terminated program, adding additional preservation costs. The Senate passed legislation prohibiting funds for research, development, test, or evaluation on the F136 engine. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with developing a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The plan must ensure long-term sustainment and repair of the property for potential use in the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program or other Government development programs. Storage or disposal options should be considered, with preservation and storage to be carried out by either the Federal Government or a contractor. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The plan must ensure long-term sustainment and repair of the property for potential use in the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program or other Government development programs. Storage or disposal options should be considered, with preservation and storage to be carried out by either the Federal Government or a contractor. None of the funds for research, development, test, and evaluation for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of the property until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees.

The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on the plan within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S.Rept. 112-77 to accompany H.R. 2219, which did not include funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act passed as part of H.R. 2055 also had no funds for the alternate engine program. The legislative history appendix covers FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill and committee report language. The legislative history appendix covers the period FY1996-FY2010, presenting final bill language and committee and conference report language for the F-35 alternate engine program. The program was initially known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program in FY1996 and FY1997. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the JAST program and required a report to be submitted before funds could be obligated. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the JAST program, required a report before funds could be obligated, and limited the obligation of funds until after the report is submitted. $7 million of the research and development funding was allocated for competitive engine concepts for the JAST program. The Senate report questioned the program's ability to meet service needs and directed the Department to include two approaches to reduce program risk. The Senate report (S.Rept. 104-112) raised concerns about the JAST program's ability to meet service needs and directed the Department to include two approaches to reduce program risk. The conferees emphasized the need for engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft in the program. The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology) was directed to ensure adequate engine competition and demonstrator aircraft scale in the JAST program plan. The conferees emphasized the importance of engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft in the JAST program, directing the Secretary of Defense to include these in the required report. Authorization of funds for competitive engine concepts was recommended, reflecting changes to reduce program risk and achieve more affordable life cycle. The FY1996 defense authorization bill emphasized the importance of engine competition in the JAST program to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee directed the Secretary of Defense to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale, full thrust aircraft demonstrators. The House Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 2126 also discussed the challenges of developing new fighter engine propulsion plants. The committee report on H.R. 2126 discussed the challenges of developing new fighter engine propulsion plants, highlighting issues with engine performance and cost for various aircraft models. The JAST program aims to address these challenges by building a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The new engine for the F-22 fighter aircraft is undergoing a redesign due to technical problems. The Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program aims to build a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but has chosen a single unproven power plant design based on the F-22 engine. The committee believes it is necessary for the JAST program to pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer to ensure cost-effectiveness. Additional funding of $20,000,000 has been provided for this purpose. The Committee has allocated an additional $20,000,000 for the JAST program to pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer, emphasizing the importance of engine competition for cost-effectiveness. This directive is in line with the FY1997 Defense Authorization Act and the DOD Appropriation Act. The DOD Appropriation Act (H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208) included funding for the JAST program, with a focus on developing an alternate engine for the Navy. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85) required a report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program by February 15, 1998. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85) mandated a report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program, including funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program in detail. The House Armed Services Committee report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program highlighted concerns about the lack of funding for the development of an alternative fighter engine. They emphasized the importance of a fully developed and flight-tested engine to reduce risks and control program costs. The Secretary of Defense was directed to provide a report detailing the funding needed for this development by February 15, 1998. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the funding needed for the development of an alternative engine for the Joint Strike Fighter Program by February 15, 1998. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended an increase in the budget request of $28.0 million to accelerate the alternative engine program. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $28.0 million increase in the budget request to accelerate the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter Program. This recommendation was made in the FY1999 Defense Authorization Act, with the expectation that the Department would program sufficient funds for an accelerated profile in the future years. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 required a report on the order of fielding JSF variants, including the naval variant acceleration. The report certified sufficient funding for an alternate engine program in a JSF airframe. The committee acknowledged the report but expressed concern over delays in demonstrating the alternate engine, which could jeopardize the initiative. The committee expressed concern over delays in demonstrating the alternate engine for the JSF airframe, which could jeopardize the initiative. An increase of $15.0 million is recommended to accelerate the development of the alternative engine. The committee supports the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to ensure industrial base capabilities, control engine costs, and reduce risks. Concerns were raised about funding levels not being sufficient for timely completion. Additionally, the Department is conducting other jet engine development efforts. Funding for these programs has increased significantly from the previous year. The committee supports the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to ensure industrial base capabilities, control engine costs, and reduce risks. The requested funding for jet engine development has increased by $66.6 million, with a focus on reducing backlog of engineering tasks for current engines. The committee recommends a decrease in funding for PE 27268F by $30.0 million and an increase in funding for PE 63800F by $30.0 million to prioritize the development of a new state-of-the-art engine for JSF. The committee recommends $130.2 million in PE 27268F and $265.4 million in PE 63800F for the joint strike fighter (JSF) program, with an increase in funding directed towards acceleration of alternate engine development. The Senate Armed Services Committee report highlighted concerns about the viability of the alternate engine program for the JSF.

Recently, the committee held hearings to review the Department's proposal to eliminate the development of the F136 alternate engine, expressing concerns about relying on one engine provider for multiple missions, services, and nations. The committee authorized $400.8 million for the development of the interchangeable engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program in fiscal year 2007. They directed the Secretary of Defense to sustain the program with two competitive propulsion systems or enter into a one-time contract for a single system throughout the aircraft's life. The report recommended developing and sustaining the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or entering into a single contract for a selected system throughout the aircraft's life cycle. Congress had previously directed the Department of Defense to address engine problems that affected aircraft readiness. In the 1970's and early 1980's, Pratt & Whitney provided engines for F\u201314, F\u201315, and F\u201316 aircraft. Due to engine problems, Congress mandated competition resulting in improved performance, readiness, cost savings, and contractor responsiveness. Congress has consistently supported engine competition for the Joint Strike Fighter program for over 10 years. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 expressed concerns about the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program, which is the largest acquisition program in Department of Defense history. Congress has supported a competitive engine program for the past 10 years, with potential deliveries of over 4,000 aircraft worldwide. The committee is worried about the risks of relying on a single engine supplier for a multi-mission aircraft and the Department's justification for terminating the F136 engine. The committee is concerned about the financial risk to the nation due to the termination of the F136 engine. The Department's analysis only accounted for 30 percent of engine costs over the aircraft's life cycle, failing to comply with economic analysis policy. A full life cycle analysis could show significant cost savings through competitive engine procurement. The committee believes that competition will generate enough savings to offset the cost of completing the F136 engine development. The committee recommends conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program to ensure sufficient savings from competitive engine procurements offset the cost of completing the F136 engine development. The committee recommends an independent life cycle cost analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems, including the F136 interchangeable engine, to ensure informed judgments on the costs of the alternatives. The Department of Defense analysis for terminating the F136 engine did not account for all life cycle costs. The report recommended an increase in funding for the development of the F136 interchangeable engine to support competitive propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee emphasized the importance of reducing operational risk and achieving more affordable life cycle costs through the use of competitive propulsion systems.

The Senate amendment, S.Amdt. 1767, aligns with the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program by removing funding and requiring certification of cost effectiveness before funds can be used. It also preserves language prohibiting DOD from obligating more than 90% of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certification is provided. In FY2010, funding for the alternate engine program was preserved, while reductions were made to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program management reserves. Funding for the HC/MC-130 aircraft program was reduced instead. S.Amdt. 1767 focused on the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. In FY2010, funding for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program required a certification for 90% of the allocated amount. An additional $282.9 million was allocated for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement. Management reserves were reduced for various programs. The Navy's aircraft procurement budget is increased by $282.9 million for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft. Additionally, $78 million each is allocated for management reserves in the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs. The Air Force's budget for research, development, test, and evaluation is increased by $78 million for the Joint Strike Fighter program, while the amount for aircraft procurement is decreased by $438.9 million for the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. S.Amdt. 1627 aims to remove restrictions on obligating F-35 research and development funds in FY2010. The committee aims to restrict the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certain certifications are made by the Secretary of Defense regarding the competitive propulsion system. This includes prohibiting funding for an alternate engine program until cost-effectiveness is confirmed, eliminating additional funding for the alternate engine program, and restoring reductions to other programs to reallocate funding. The Senate Armed Services Committee markup added funding for the alternate engine program but also restored cuts to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program reserves to offset the additional funding. S.Amdt. 1627 imposes limitations on using funds for the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 program and increases funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z aircraft procurement and F-35 program management reserves. The Act prohibits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 program until the Secretary of Defense certifies it will reduce costs and improve readiness without disrupting the program or reducing aircraft procurement. The Act prohibits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 program until the Secretary of Defense certifies it will reduce costs and improve readiness without disrupting the program or reducing aircraft procurement. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement and restoration of management reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The funding for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter program is increased by $78,000,000 for management reserves. This increase is offset by a decrease of $219,450,000 for the F136 development in the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs. The Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter program funding is decreased by $219,450,000 for F136 development, offsetting a $78,000,000 increase for management reserves. This change was part of the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) signed into law on December 19, 2009. On December 15, 2009, an explanatory statement was released for the final version of H.R. 3326, which was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law as P.L. 111-118 on December 19, 2009. The statement allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The explanatory statement provided $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, with an increase of $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Additionally, Air Force research and development funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program was $2.073.1 million, while Navy research and development funding was $1,956.3 million, both with additional funds designated for the F-35 alternate engine program. Concerns persist regarding the progress of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program faces concerns about cost growth and schedule issues, despite the Department of Defense's insistence that it is on track. The program is allocated $6,840,478,000 for procurement, with a directive to procure all 30 aircraft as requested in the budget. The JSF procurement program is allocated $6,840,478,000, designated as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense must ensure all 30 aircraft are procured as requested. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to provide findings on the test program and causes of cost growth to congressional defense committees by January 15, 2010. House Appropriations Committee recommends a net increase in funding for the F-35 program. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a net increase in funding for the F-35 program, including an increase in Air Force procurement funding and Navy research and development funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The Committee supports realistic budgeting and opposes terminating programs prematurely. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including for the alternate engine. They support realistic budgeting and oppose premature program terminations. The Committee believes that continuing certain efforts, such as the presidential helicopter and Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine, may yield significant benefits. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine. The F-35 program is crucial for the nation's future tactical aviation needs, with plans to procure over 2,500 stealthy aircraft. Despite initial plans for two engine variants, all F-35 aircraft will now be powered by the same engine, raising concerns about logistics complexity in the future. The Committee is concerned about the F-35 aircraft all being powered by the same engine, which could lead to logistical issues and potential grounding of the entire fleet in case of technical problems. They also highlight the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, which could result in missed cost-saving opportunities with over 2,500 aircraft planned for the program. The Committee recommends an additional $430,000,000 for the development of a dual-source strategy for the propulsion engine of the Joint Strike Fighter, citing potential cost savings and the need for competition in the program. The recommendation provides $560,000,000 for the development and production of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of a dual-source strategy. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests. The Administration strongly opposes additional funding for the F-35 alternate engine, citing it as unnecessary and a diversion of resources from the overall program. The current engine is deemed sufficient, and the risks of a single engine provider are manageable. Veto recommendation may be made if the final bill disrupts the F-35 program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the alternate engine development. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the F-35 alternate engine development in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee included $485 million for the alternate engine in H.R. 5136, with a provision limiting DOD's spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act includes a limitation on the procurement of F-35 Lightning II aircraft until all funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. This requirement must be met before DOD can acquire more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits the procurement of F-35 Lightning II aircraft until funds for a competitive propulsion system are obligated. This must happen before the DOD can acquire more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act requires certification by January 15, 2011 for the procurement of F136 engines, including availability for testing and completion of test hours. H.R. 5136 also mandates inclusion of alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission. Less than 1,000 test hours completed in the F136 system development and demonstration program. H.R. 5136 mandates inclusion of alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission for competitive propulsion system for F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the defense budget materials. This funding must also be included in future-years defense programs to ensure continued development and procurement. Additionally, funds must be obligated and expended for research, development, test, and evaluation of the propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the defense budget materials. This funding should be included in future-years defense programs to guarantee continued development and procurement. Additionally, funds must be obligated and expended for research, development, test, and evaluation of the propulsion system. The term 'budget' for a fiscal year refers to the budget submitted to Congress by the President. 'Defense budget materials' for a fiscal year are materials submitted by the Secretary of Defense to support the budget. H.R. 5136 designated competitive F-35 engine programs as major subprograms, with stricter oversight and reporting requirements. Section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 was repealed. The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs were designated as major subprograms. H.R. 5136 repealed Section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 and designated the F-35 engine programs as major subprograms, with stricter oversight and reporting requirements. The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs were specifically designated as major subprograms. The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs are designated as major subprograms with reporting requirements. The Secretary will use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for each subprogram. If the Secretary decides to restructure the F-35 program, reassessment and actions will be taken for the engine programs as well. During fiscal year 2010, the acquisition program underwent reassessment and actions as required by section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs were also reassessed based on the original baseline. Actions taken in accordance with this reassessment will meet the requirements of section 2433a for designated major subprograms. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, in relation to a major subprogram. It states that if programmatic changes cause a significant increase in costs for the subprogram, the requirements of section 2433a will not be considered met. Additionally, the report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program under Air Force Research & Development/Items of Special Interest. The report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, stating that the budget request contained funds for development of the F-35 aircraft but not for a competitive propulsion system. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the currently-planned F135 engine, with Congress appropriating funds for this program in the past four years. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not included funds for the development of the competitive F136 engine, despite Congress appropriating funds for the past four years. This goes against the National Defense Authorization Act and the committee's recommendations. The committee expressed disappointment in the Department of Defense for not including funds for the F136 engine development, despite Congress appropriating funds for the past four years. Cost increases in the F135 engine program were noted, with the GAO reporting a 50% increase in development costs to $7.3 billion. The negotiated prices for F-35 engines in fiscal year 2009 were significantly higher than budget estimates. In 2009, the negotiated prices for F-35 engines were higher than budget estimates, with a 21% increase for the F-35B engine and lift fan, and a 42% increase for the F-35A engine. A Joint Assessment Team reviewed the F135 cost structure due to these cost increases, finding credible but challenging improvement plans that would require additional investment by the contractor for cost reduction initiatives. An additional $2.9 billion investment over six years was deemed necessary to complete the F136 engine development. The committee provided an update on the 2007 DOD report for the competitive engine program, stating that $2.9 billion would be needed to finish F136 engine development. They questioned the Department's decision not to include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the F-35 competitive propulsion system program, citing non-financial benefits such as better engine performance and increased reliability. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor have failed to meet cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews by the Department of Defense. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor failed to meet cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews by the Department of Defense. The JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion increase in costs for the F-35 development program, while the IMRT found high production ramp rates to be risky. To mitigate risks, the Department of Defense plans to procure an additional F-35C. The Department of Defense plans to reduce production risk for the F-35 program by procuring an additional F-35C, setting up a software simulation facility, using operational F-35s for testing, adjusting production rates, and increasing budget. These actions will delay development by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more. The F-35 program will be delayed by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more than planned. The Secretary of the Air Force informed the committee about exceeding unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent. Testimonies described the program as facing unprecedented concurrency in development, test, and production activities. Late delivery of test aircraft was highlighted as a primary issue. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, including late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic system development plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite concerns about design changes and production process alterations, the request for 43 total F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains the same as projected in fiscal year 2009. The committee is concerned about the significant risks and impacts of required design changes for the F-35 aircraft. They recommend reducing the production ramp rate until developmental testing is complete. The committee recommends authorizing the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to certain milestones being completed by January 15, 2011. The committee recommends a provision requiring certification of certain milestones before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The Administration objects to adding $485 million for the extra engine program and legislative provisions limiting JSF development funding. The committee recommends provisions for JSF development funding, including a requirement to ensure funding for the extra engine program. Secretary Gates notes the need for an additional $2.4 billion investment for the extra engine. The Department does not believe this cost will be recovered or should be diverted from other defense needs. The current engine is performing well with extensive testing. The current engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is performing well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The report recommends a certification requirement before further funding for the alternate engine is approved. The committee recommends a provision for the Secretary of Defense to certify that developing an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs and improve readiness before additional funds are spent on the F136 engine. H.R. 6523 did not specify funding for the alternate engine or the F-35 program itself. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine or the F-35 program itself. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft as a major subprogram. The Milestone B decision will serve as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Subsequent restructuring of the program may occur following a reassessment and actions required by specific sections of the United States Code. The Secretary of Defense may restructure the F-35 aircraft program and engine development program after reassessment and actions required by specific sections of the United States Code in fiscal year 2010. This will meet the requirements for designated major subprograms under section 2433a of title 10, US Code. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act states that meeting the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, US Code for a major subprogram is contingent upon the Secretary of Defense conducting reassessment and taking actions. If programmatic changes cause a significant increase in costs post-enactment, the requirements are not considered met. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program, which was added by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version of the bill did not allocate funds for the program, but the House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels, funding the alternate engine program at the same level from October 1, 2010. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels, funding the alternate engine program at the same level from October 1, 2010. On February 16, 2011, the House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the alternate engine program. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided DOD funding for the remainder of FY2011 with no funds allocated for the F-35 alternate engine program. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) provided DOD funding for the remainder of FY2011 with no funds allocated for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in establishing an F-35 alternate engine program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994 for Air Force F-16 fighters. General Electric developed the F110 as an alternate engine for the F-16 due to Air Force frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management of the F100. Congress provided funding for the Engine Model Derivative Program for General Electric to develop the F101 engine, which later became the F110. The competition between the F110 and F100 was unprecedented and controversial. The F110 was developed to compete with the F100, with $600 million invested to improve the F100's durability and reliability. Annual competitions for engine procurement were controversial but believed to result in better engines and contract terms. Testimony suggested that competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney led to benefits for the DOD. General Electric and Pratt & Whitney competed for annual production and O&S work, benefiting the DOD with improved contract terms, warranties, and engine quality. The Great Engine War's success was attributed to how the competition was managed, with contractors providing cost projections for six years before the first contract award. Pratt & Whitney provided six years of cost projections for engine production, support equipment, spare engines, technical data, and dual sourcing data for O&S. The Air Force awarded firm-fixed price contracts for six years from the first production lot, a new approach compared to previous contracts. Contractors agreed to provide future cost projections, including plans for dual sourcing critical parts to prevent disruptions and price gouging. The DOD required contractors to provide plans for dual sourcing critical parts to prevent disruptions and price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to end the self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the program schedules. The U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program, and despite offering to continue development, the FET will now cease its work. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team ended the development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter after accumulating over 1,200 hours of testing. The program consistently delivered on cost and schedule, receiving high marks from the Department of Defense. GE and Rolls-Royce advocated for defense acquisition reform and competition in the JSF program. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team ended development of the F136 engine for the JSF program after successful testing. They emphasized the importance of competition in defense acquisition reform. GE and Rolls-Royce expressed gratitude to Congressional supporters and military experts."
