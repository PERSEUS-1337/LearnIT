    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant health concern, being the second leading cause of cancer death among men. In 2009, over 190,000 new cases were diagnosed, resulting in more than 27,000 deaths. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer. Younger men are also at risk, with aggressive forms appearing in early middle age. Racial and ethnic disparities exist, with African-Americans having double the mortality rates compared to the White population. Underserved rural populations also face higher rates of prostate cancer. African-Americans have double the prostate cancer mortality rates compared to White population. Underserved rural populations also have higher mortality rates. Urologists diagnose and treat most prostate cancer patients. Many unanswered questions remain regarding disparities in disease etiology, access to care, and education. Despite significant progress in understanding prostate cancer, many unanswered questions remain, such as the causes of the disease and the challenge of differentiating between aggressive and indolent forms early on. This lack of clarity leads to significant overtreatment, with no durable treatments available once the cancer has metastasized. A substantial proportion of cases may be clinically indolent, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Improved tests are needed to reduce unnecessary physical and emotional burden on patients and their families. Improved tests for prostate cancer can reduce unnecessary physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for patients and their families. This can also lead to significant cost savings in healthcare systems. Coordination of research and healthcare programs is needed to translate research into practice effectively. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated across Federal agencies to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify and implement best practices for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Prostate cancer coordination and education. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force. This task force will develop a summary of prostate cancer research advancements and compile best practices for broader adoption in healthcare programs. They will also consider guidance for physicians on screening men over a certain age. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will compile best practices for broader adoption in healthcare programs, consider guidance for physicians on screening men over age 74 on a case-by-case basis, and share information on Federal research and health care program activities. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for collaborative research and health care programs to address prostate cancer, including innovative approaches and evaluation of related factors. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to evaluate factors related to prostate cancer etiology, develop innovative research approaches, coordinate screening and treatment messages, and submit recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within two years of its establishment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within two years, including changes to research and health care programs across federal agencies to support research and health care priorities. The Prostate Cancer Task Force recommendations aim to support research and health care priorities, prevent duplication among federal agencies, increase public participation, and improve dissemination of information on prostate cancer research and progress. The Prostate Cancer Task Force recommendations focus on disseminating information on research progress, expanding partnerships between public and private entities, assessing cost savings, and ensuring no conflicts with other mandates. The Prostate Cancer Task Force recommendations include expanding successful efforts, identifying priority action items, and determining funding needs for implementation. Members of the Task Force are representatives from relevant Federal agencies to coordinate messages on prostate cancer screening and treatment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force, composed of representatives from Federal agencies, coordinates messages on prostate cancer screening and treatment. It appoints expert advisory panels for input from medical, research, and delivery communities. The Prostate Cancer Task Force appoints expert advisory panels for input from medical, research, and delivery communities, convening meetings at least twice a year and submitting recommendations to Congress. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit recommendations to Congress from the Prostate Cancer Task Force. The Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Task Force, with an exception regarding the termination of advisory committees. The Prostate Cancer Task Force recommendations must be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with other departments, will establish a program to intensify prostate cancer research. This program aims to develop better diagnostic methods, understand the disease's causes, and focus on lifestyle factors affecting different ethnic groups. The program aims to intensify prostate cancer research by analyzing lifestyle factors affecting different ethnic groups, expanding basic research, testing novel agents for prevention and treatment, establishing clinical registries, and utilizing appropriate imaging modalities. The Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board is established to accelerate research data sharing and the movement of new medicines to patients. The Underserved Minority Grant Program aims to address racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer research by awarding grants to eligible entities for research components and integrating existing knowledge from comparative effectiveness research. The Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board aims to accelerate research data sharing and the movement of new medicines to patients. The Underserved Minority Grant Program addresses disparities in prostate cancer research by integrating existing knowledge and recognizing racial and ethnic disparities in incidence and mortality rates, barriers in access to care, needed outreach efforts, and appropriate utilization of imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved populations, including African-Americans, Latin-Americans, American Indians, and rural areas. The projects aim to improve specialist care coordination, utilize physician extender teams, and enhance tumor board counseling for patients. Eligible entities will be selected to participate in these pilot projects. The Secretary will select eligible entities for telehealth pilot projects focusing on diagnosing and treating prostate cancer in medically underserved areas, with priority given to African-Americans, Latin-Americans, Indian Health Service facilities, and rural areas. The evaluation will assess the effectiveness and cost efficiency of care delivery using telehealth services and collaborative health professionals. The study focuses on using telehealth services to diagnose and treat prostate cancer in medically underserved and tribal areas. It aims to improve the capacity of nonmedical providers and nonspecialized medical providers to deliver health services for prostate cancer. Additionally, it explores the effectiveness of using telehealth services for prostate cancer treatment in these areas. The pilot projects aim to improve coordination of care through primary care teams and telehealth services for prostate cancer treatment in underserved areas. A report on outcomes, cost savings, and recommendations for expanding telehealth services will be submitted to Congress within 12 months. SEC. 6. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, focusing on encouraging men to seek screening. The campaign will address racial disparities and target men with a family history of prostate cancer, with grants awarded to nonprofit entities for implementation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will award grants to nonprofit entities for testing alternative outreach and education strategies in a national campaign for prostate cancer, targeting men with a family history of the disease. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 to carry out the Act."
