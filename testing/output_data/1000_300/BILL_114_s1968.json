    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impacts of products in its market. Consumers lack standing to enforce the prohibition on goods made with forced or convict labor under the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which has exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities domestically. The provision prohibiting importation of goods made with forced or convict labor has exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities domestically. Mechanisms under Federal law to prevent forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in supply chains suffer from limited scope and lack of information. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 addresses these issues. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts if contractors engage in trafficking or forced labor. United States courts also have jurisdiction over Federal employees involved in these crimes abroad. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 grants U.S. courts criminal jurisdiction over Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors involved in severe forms of trafficking or forced labor. Executive orders and laws prohibit Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities like charging recruitment fees or confiscating passports. Federal contractors and subcontractors are prohibited from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. They must maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan that includes a complaint mechanism and procedures to prevent subcontractors from engaging in trafficking. Congress acknowledges the importance of these measures. The sense of Congress is that forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are severe forms of abuse for profit. Legislation is needed to prevent these practices and provide consumers with information on products free from these abuses. Legislation is necessary to provide consumers with information on products free from child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in the United States. Through publicly available disclosures, businesses and consumers can avoid supporting these crimes in the supply chains. Legislation is needed to disclose information on efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, trafficking in persons, and the worst forms of child labor. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require covered issuers to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Regulations will be promulgated within a year of the Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 amendment requires covered issuers to disclose measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain. This includes maintaining policies to identify and eliminate these risks. The covered issuer must disclose policies to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain, including prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors and evaluating and addressing related risks. The covered issuer must disclose efforts to evaluate and address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the product supply chain, including any identified risks and measures taken to eliminate them. The evaluation process should specify if conducted by a third party and involve consultation with independent labor organizations. The disclosure process for evaluating and addressing risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the product supply chain must specify if conducted by a third party, involve consultation with independent labor organizations, workers' associations, or workers within workplaces, and describe the entities consulted and the method of consultation. The covered issuer must specify the consultation process for evaluating risks in the supply chain, including audits of suppliers to investigate working conditions and labor practices. The covered issuer must investigate suppliers' working conditions, labor practices, and systems to identify risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chain. They must also ensure suppliers comply with the issuer's policies or equivalent efforts. The covered issuer must require suppliers to attest compliance with laws on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. They should also maintain internal accountability standards and reporting procedures for non-compliant entities in the supply chain. The covered issuer must establish standards, systems, and procedures for supply chain entities to comply with laws on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Employees and management responsible for supply chain management should receive training on mitigating risks within product supply chains. The covered issuer must ensure that labor recruitment practices at all suppliers comply with policies to eliminate exploitive labor practices contributing to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. This includes conducting audits of labor recruiters and disclosing the audit results. The covered issuer must ensure compliance with labor recruitment policies to prevent forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. This involves conducting audits of labor recruiters and disclosing the results. Remedial action must be taken in cases of identified labor violations within the supply chain. The regulations require covered issuers to disclose information on their website labeled 'Global Supply Chain Transparency' and the Commission to list covered issuers' measures to address forced labor on its website. The regulations mandate covered issuers with annual global receipts exceeding $100,000,000 to disclose actions taken to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. The Commission's website will feature a list of these issuers and compile the information submitted under the rules. The definitions in this subsection clarify that a covered issuer is one with annual global receipts over $100,000,000, and forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking refer to violations of national and international standards. Remedial action is also defined. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"remedial action\" as activities put in place by an issuer to address non-compliance, and the term \"supply chain\" in relation to a covered issuer disclosing required information. The curr_chunk defines the terms \"covered issuer\" and \"the worst forms of child labor\" in relation to disclosing required information under regulations."
