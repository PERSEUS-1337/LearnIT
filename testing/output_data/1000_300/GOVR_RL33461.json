    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed an appropriations bill that includes $100 million more than the Administration's request. The House passed an FY2019 appropriations bill for Energy and Water Development, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, that includes $100 million more than the Administration requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill, passed on June 25, 2018, includes no Yucca Mountain funding. DOE had submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository to the NRC on June 3, 2008, as required by NWPA. The Obama Administration announced it would request no further funding for the project and moved to withdraw the application on March 3, 2010. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository project in 2010 and withdrew the application. Congress approved the funding halt but has not amended NWPA, which still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole repository candidate site. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new nuclear waste policy, including the development of one or more waste repositories and storage facilities. A new \"single-purpose organization\" with authority and resources should develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent-based\" process. Long-term research on disposal technologies is recommended. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, proposing a new entity for developing storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility was planned to open by 2021. The DOE proposed a strategy in 2013 for nuclear waste management, including the development of consent-based storage and disposal sites. Plans included opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was to open by 2048. In 2017, a draft consent-based siting process was issued, and in 2018, a bill was approved to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste storage. The House approved bill H.R. 3053 to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste storage, meeting NRC licensing conditions. NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report in response to a court order, determining the repository's compliance with safety standards. Volume 3 of the report concluded that the design would meet standards after being sealed permanently. NRC staff recommended not authorizing construction until all land and water issues are resolved. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report in response to a court order, stating that the Yucca Mountain repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards after being permanently sealed. However, construction should not be authorized until all land and water rights requirements are met, and a supplement to DOE's environmental impact statement is completed. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that an additional $330 million is needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on issues raised by Nevada. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain, plus $120 million for DOE to defend its license application for the repository and develop interim storage facilities. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities, aiming to make the licensing process easier than a combined defense-civilian repository. The DOE proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, potentially easier to site and license due to smaller waste volumes and radioactivity. The repository would still need to comply with NRC licensing and NWPA requirements. The DOE proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework. The repository would be subject to NRC licensing and NWPA requirements. The GAO criticized DOE's analysis for excluding major costs and having an optimistic schedule. Republican leaders criticized the plan as a way to deflect efforts on Yucca Mountain. Republican leaders criticized the DOE's plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository as a way to deflect efforts on Yucca Mountain. Legislation introduced would block development of the defense-only repository before NRC issues a licensing decision on Yucca Mountain. Provisions for consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel were included in the FY2019 appropriations bill. Provisions for consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel were included in the FY2019 appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) passed by the Senate on June 25, 2018. Priority for storage at the pilot facilities would be given to spent fuel from closed nuclear plant sites, with requirements for state and local consent, compensation considerations, and a plan for eventual transfer to a permanent repository. The Senate included provisions for consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The bill would prioritize storage for spent fuel from closed nuclear plant sites and require state and local consent, compensation considerations, and a plan for eventual transfer to a permanent repository. The House passed a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) authorizing DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities owned by non-federal entities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. The bill introduced in the 114th Congress, known as the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854), aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to find sites for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities with consent from state and local officials and affected Indian tribes. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico on March 30, 2017. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico on March 30, 2017. The facility, to be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, will hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos, with a total storage capacity of about 120,000 metric tons. Waste Control Specialists also filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas on April 28, 2016. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with construction potentially completed by 2022. WCS operates two low-level radioactive waste storage facilities in Texas with local support. The company had plans to complete construction by 2022 but requested a suspension of the license application. WCS proposed that DOE would take title to spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay for storage for up to 40 years. Legislation passed by the House in 2018 included provisions for DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The House passed legislation (H.R. 3053) authorizing DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. Bills introduced in previous Congresses also proposed DOE taking title to spent nuclear fuel for private storage. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested funding for Yucca Mountain, the first since FY2010. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested $1.5 billion for private interim storage, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for Yucca Mountain, with $47.7 million for NRC license and $10 million for interim storage facilities. Funding would come from Nuclear Waste Disposal and Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal accounts. The DOE funding for Yucca Mountain includes $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The bill for FY2019, combined with other appropriations bills, passed the House with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill did not include Yucca Mountain funding, continuing a pattern of funding uncertainty. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees from power generators in 2014 due to a court ruling. The DOE funding for Yucca Mountain has faced uncertainty in recent years, with funding not being approved. In 2014, DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees from power generators following a court ruling due to uncertainty about the program's future. The fees, totaling about $750 million per year, were supposed to cover waste disposal costs, but the court found DOE's waste plans too vague for accurate cost estimates. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans for Yucca Mountain are too vague for accurate cost estimates, with a cost uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. NRC approved a final rule in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule struck down in 2012. The NRC approved a final rule in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule struck down in 2012 by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing the waste confidence findings in 2010. The NRC halted licensing of new nuclear plants due to a court ruling striking down the waste confidence rule. However, in 2014, the NRC approved a rule for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, allowing for final licensing decisions to resume. A lawsuit challenging the continued storage rule was rejected in 2016. NRC also proposed changes to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final revisions issued by the commission in 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure public protection. Nuclear waste, particularly highly radioactive spent fuel, remains a major challenge for the nuclear power industry. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for nuclear waste, despite strong opposition from Nevada due to safety concerns. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain repository due to safety concerns such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, and water infiltration. The George W. Bush Administration deemed the site suitable for a repository, but the Obama Administration decided against opening it, citing Nevada's opposition. The Obama Administration decided not to open the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition. Funding for the project was halted in FY2011, and the program was shut down at the end of FY2010. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million in his FY2019 budget submission. President Trump plans to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage in his FY2019 budget submission to Congress on February 12, 2018. DOE would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. DOE had previously filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application under the Obama Administration. The Yucca Mountain license application was withdrawn \"with prejudice\" on March 3, 2010, by the DOE, but faced opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. The ASLB denied the DOE's withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, stating that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC halted further consideration of the license application due to budgetary limitations. Lawsuits filed to overturn the Yucca Mountain license withdrawal were ruled in favor of continuing work on the application as long as funding is available. NRC directed staff to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report on November 18, 2013. The NRC had $11.1 million in funds for the Yucca Mountain project. The safety evaluation report was completed in 2014, concluding the design met safety standards for 1 million years. NRC issued the final volumes of the report in 2015, stating construction should not proceed until all requirements were met. The supplemental environmental impact statement was completed in 2016. The NRC completed the supplemental EIS for the Yucca Mountain project in May 2016, making licensing documents publicly available. Additional appropriations of $330 million were deemed necessary to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on numerous issues raised by Nevada and others. The Obama Administration halted the project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternative waste disposal strategies, with the final report issued on January 26, 2012. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future in 2010 to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended creating a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities using a consent-based process. In response, the DOE issued a strategy in January 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, calling for a new entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing nuclear waste, calling for a new entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. This included plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public input was sought to address issues such as fairness in the siting process and information requirements. The DOE announced public meetings in mid-2016 to gather feedback on the concept of a consent-based siting process for nuclear waste management. The process includes five phases, starting with community outreach and ending with a detailed site assessment. Legislation would authorize funding for a waste management agency to conduct the process and provide grants to interested communities. The DOE's consent-based siting process for nuclear waste management includes five phases: community outreach, preliminary site assessment, detailed site assessment, agreement negotiation, and licensing, construction, operation, and closure. The process involves funding for a waste management agency, grants to interested communities, and negotiations between potential host communities and the waste management agency. Phase 5 of the nuclear waste management process involves licensing, construction, operation, and closure of storage facilities. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project, legal and technical support for licensing, and preparation for waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completing the licensing review of Yucca Mountain. The nuclear power industry supports completing the licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage and disposal facilities. The safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste depends on rock formations characteristics. Isolating radioactive materials until they decay to safe levels is technically feasible. The National Research Council states that geologic isolation is the best long-term option for high-level waste. However, specific sites like Yucca Mountain face challenges due to uncertainties in predicting waste site behavior, such as water intrusion or earthquake vulnerability. President Obama's budgets for FY2017 and previous years included long-term research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed large-scale facilities for spent fuel reprocessing to recycle elements like plutonium into new fuel. However, challenges remain in predicting waste site behavior and addressing public concerns over waste transportation routes. The Obama Administration focused on long-term research to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity, while the Trump Administration proposed sharp reductions in funding for spent fuel reprocessing. The Bush Administration had proposed large-scale facilities for reprocessing spent fuel, but challenges remain in waste site behavior prediction and addressing public concerns over waste transportation routes. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn who issued a state veto. Congress approved the site in July 2002. Low-level radioactive waste disposal is a contentious issue, with facilities in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington handling waste from various sources. Low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities are located in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. The Washington facility only accepts waste from its region, while the South Carolina site is available to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. A Utah facility accepts class A waste from anywhere in the United States. Congressional authorization in 1985 led to the creation of regional compacts for waste disposal. The first new disposal site under this system opened in Texas in 2011. The first new disposal site under the regional compact system for low-level radioactive waste opened in Texas in 2011. The Texas Legislature approved legislation allowing states outside the Texas Compact to use up to 30% of the facility's capacity. DOE was authorized to enter contracts with U.S. generators of nuclear waste for disposal, with a deadline of January 31, 1998, which was missed leading to lawsuits by nuclear utilities. The disposal contract with DOE required nuclear waste disposal to start by January 31, 1998. DOE missed the deadline, leading to lawsuits by nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. A settlement with PECO Energy Company allowed them to keep $80 million in waste fees, but other utilities sued to block it. The court ruled that compensation for missed deadlines must come from general funds. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that nuclear waste fees cannot be used as compensation for missed disposal deadlines. Compensation to utilities has come from the Judgment Fund, totaling $6.9 billion by FY2017. 39 lawsuits were settled, representing 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity generation. The U.S. Department of Energy has paid out $6.9 billion in compensation to utilities for nuclear waste delays through settlements and court judgments. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims for delay-related costs, with disputes going to arbitration. Those not settled continue seeking compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Awards from the Court of Claims only cover incurred damages, requiring utilities to file claims for additional costs as they accrue. DOE estimates potential liabilities for nuclear waste delays at $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid. Delays could lead to environmental enforcement actions over DOE-owned waste. Noncompliant storage may result in fines if waste isn't removed as per compliance schedules. The DOE faces potential fines for noncompliant storage of nuclear waste, as it halted the Yucca Mountain project and suspended fee collections. Lawsuits were filed to end nuclear waste fees by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute in 2010. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute filed lawsuits in 2010 to end nuclear waste fees totaling about $750 million per year. The DOE argued that the fees must continue to be collected for future disposal costs, and Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined in 2010 that excess funds were not being collected. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that the nuclear waste fee should continue unchanged. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that Secretary Chu's determination on nuclear waste fees was not valid and ordered a more thorough study within six months. The court required evaluation of alternative waste management scenarios to determine the level of fees needed. DOE responded with a new fee assessment in January 2013, revealing that some scenarios exceeded projected revenues. DOE conducted a new fee adequacy assessment in January 2013 to evaluate various waste management scenarios. Some scenarios showed costs exceeding projected revenues by up to $2 trillion, while others resulted in a surplus of $5 trillion. Due to the wide range of results, DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to immediately adjust the fee. Following a request for review by NEI and NARUC, the Circuit Court ordered DOE to halt nuclear waste fee collection in November 2013, citing the program's vague plans and a $7 trillion uncertainty range in cost estimates as reasons. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague for a reasonable cost estimate, leading to the halt of nuclear waste fee collection. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates. DOE also filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice in 2010. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" in 2010, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. The Obama Administration's policy change was influenced by opposition from Nevada and a desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The ASLB denied the license withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" in 2010, citing the need for finality in ending the project. The ASLB denied the motion, stating that DOE cannot unilaterally terminate the review process until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. DOE argued that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. In July 2010, DOE appealed the ASLB decision to NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has authority to make policy decisions on nuclear waste disposal, including discontinuing the Yucca Mountain project. NRC sustained the denial of license withdrawal in September 2011 but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, petitioned the court to order NRC to continue licensing proceedings after the rejection of the withdrawal motion. The Court of Appeals ordered NRC to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application despite budget constraints. NRC had $11.1 million in funds for this purpose and completed the Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015. Additional funding of $330 million would be needed to complete the licensing review. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for Yucca Mountain, with additional funding of $330 million required for the licensing review. DOE's FY2018 budget includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and $30 million for NRC to restart adjudicatory proceedings. NRC must ensure safe disposal of waste before issuing licenses for nuclear reactors and waste storage facilities. The NRC is requested to restart the ASLB adjudicatory proceeding to determine the safe disposal of nuclear waste before issuing licenses for reactors and waste storage facilities. The Waste Confidence Decision in 1984 stated that waste could be stored safely for 30 years after plant closure, with a permanent repository expected by 2007-2009. Due to delays in opening a repository, the decision was updated in 1990 to expect a repository by the first quarter of the 21st century. Another waste confidence rule was issued in 2010 when the Yucca Mountain repository was further delayed. The NRC issued a waste confidence rule in 2010, stating that a repository would be available \"when necessary\" and waste could be stored safely at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed to overturn this rule due to concerns about environmental risks of long-term waste storage. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision under NEPA. The court ruled in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision under NEPA. Two major flaws were found in NRC's rulemaking process regarding permanent storage availability and safety of on-site storage for spent fuel. NRC approved a final rule in 2014 to replace the waste confidence rule that had been struck down. The NRC halted new facilities producing nuclear waste for over two years to respond to a court ruling. A final rule was approved in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, describing environmental effects based on a generic environmental impact statement. The statement analyzed potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would be available. The environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available were analyzed: \"short-term timeframe\" for up to 60 years, \"long-term timeframe\" for up to 160 years, and an \"indefinite timeframe.\" The environmental impact was deemed minimal in almost all categories. A consolidated lawsuit to overturn NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a lawsuit to overturn NRC's storage rule for Yucca Mountain. Congressional controversy arose over the termination of work on the repository by the Obama Administration. President Trump's proposal to restart the licensing process has shifted the debate on nuclear waste in Congress. Funding for Yucca Mountain has not been provided by the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project in FY2018 and FY2019, while the Senate did not allocate any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada pressed Governor Perry on the issue of Yucca Mountain. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada pressed Governor Perry on the issue of Yucca Mountain during his confirmation process, emphasizing Nevada's opposition to becoming a nuclear waste dumping ground. She expressed belief in Governor Perry's understanding of the issue and willingness to work together to prevent Yucca Mountain from being used as a repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) aimed to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site from public lands laws and place it under DOE control, while also authorizing DOE to store spent fuel at an NRC-licensed interim storage facility. The House bill passed on May 10, 2018, would meet a key condition for licensing the Yucca Mountain repository by transferring control solely to the DOE. It also allows for storage of spent fuel at a nonfederal interim storage facility and increases the repository's capacity to 110,000 metric tons. The bill includes changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee's version, such as removing mandatory funding provisions to address past misuse of the Nuclear Waste Fund. The House bill passed on May 10, 2018, would transfer control solely to the DOE for licensing the Yucca Mountain repository and allow for interim storage of spent fuel at a nonfederal facility. It increases the repository's capacity to 110,000 metric tons and removes mandatory funding provisions to address past misuse of the Nuclear Waste Fund. The bill also specifies the use of Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. The DOE could accept spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactor sites for storage at an MRS facility, transferring ownership to the Secretary of Energy. The DOE could build and operate federal MRS facilities or store fuel at nonfederal MRS facilities with agreements. Prior to NRC licensing, an MRS agreement with a nonfederal entity would require state and local approvals. The DOE received waste storage approval from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribe for the MRS facility. Priority for fuel shipment to MRS would be given to closed reactors. Appropriations for MRS would come from the general fund. Storage at MRS would wait for NRC approval for Yucca Mountain or Secretary of Energy decision. H.R. 3053 proposes authorizing an MRS facility from the general fund instead of the Nuclear Waste Fund. Waste storage at the MRS facility would be contingent on NRC approval for Yucca Mountain or a decision from the Secretary of Energy. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be located on federal land encompassing parts of DOE's Nevada Test Site and the Nellis Air Force Range. H.R. 3053 proposes permanently withdrawing 147,000 acres of federal land for the development of a permanent underground repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. The site would be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Energy, and NRC's final decision on issuing a construction authorization would be required within 30 months. The Act requires federal waste facilities to comply with hazardous waste requirements. NRC must make a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository within 30 months. DOE can conduct infrastructure activities at the site before the decision. The limit on spent nuclear fuel disposal at Yucca Mountain would increase to 110,000 metric tons. DOE is prohibited from planning a separate repository until NRC's decision. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume nuclear waste fees collection until NRC's final decision. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume collection of nuclear waste fees until NRC reaches a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Fees collected after enactment would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program, limiting collections to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations. Any uncollected fees may be required to be paid later. Annual appropriations up to the amount of fees collected would net to zero during the appropriations process. The bill specifies that annual appropriations up to the amount of available fees would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program, ensuring that such appropriations would not count against annual discretionary funding allocations. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available for appropriation without offsets. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into a benefits agreement with the State of Nevada to provide annual payments before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into a benefits agreement with the State of Nevada, in consultation with affected units of local government, to provide annual payments of $15 million before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would receive $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt and annual payments thereafter of $40 million. DOE could also reach benefits agreements with other affected local governments, all subject to congressional appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would be responsible for carrying out these functions. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act would require the Secretary of Energy to obtain consent from affected parties before hosting a repository. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would oversee these functions and could serve up to two five-year terms. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced companion versions of the Act in 2017. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act (S. 95, H.R. 456) introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus in 2017 requires consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. Representative Joe Wilson also introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) on the same day, which prohibits DOE from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a construction permit. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson in the 114th Congress would prevent the DOE from building a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a construction permit for the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, there are proposals for private-sector interim storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico, with a bill (H.R. 474) introduced to authorize DOE to contract with these facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017, similar to previous legislation, would allow DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for storage at private facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to fund the storage without further congressional approval. Another bill, the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017, would authorize DOE to store spent fuel at privately owned facilities, prioritizing sites with no operating reactors and large populations nearby. Legislation introduced in 2017, known as S. 1903 and H.R. 3970, aims to assist communities with stored nuclear waste by providing financial assistance, tax credits, and eligibility for government programs. The bills also establish a task force to streamline the process for communities applying for government assistance and require the Department of Energy to take action on the issue. The bills introduced aim to assist communities with stored nuclear waste by providing financial assistance, tax credits, and eligibility for government programs. They also establish a task force to streamline the process for communities applying for assistance and require the Department of Energy to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the risks of spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants, leading to proposed legislation like the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) introduced in the 115th Congress by Representative Engel aims to require nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for transferring spent fuel from storage pools to dry storage facilities within seven years. It also proposes expanding emergency planning zones and authorizing the use of interest earned by the Nuclear Waste Fund to provide grants for this purpose. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses by other representatives and senators. H.R. 4891 aims to provide grants for nuclear power plants to transfer spent fuel to dry storage. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses by other representatives and senators. The proposed legislation, S. 854, aimed to establish nuclear waste storage facilities with the consent of state, local, and tribal governments. It required the Nuclear Waste Administration to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048. Authorization to select sites for nonpriority waste storage was contingent on funds being allocated for a permanent repository within the first 10 years. During the first 10 years after enactment, the agency obligated funds for developing a permanent waste repository. NWA could not request proposals for nonpriority waste or select sites without a candidate site for a repository. Financial compensation and incentives could be offered for hosting nuclear waste facilities. Sites with storage facilities and a repository would receive preference. Defense waste could be placed in defense-only facilities under S. 854. President Obama authorized a defense-only repository in 2015. Nuclear waste fees collected were to be held in a Working Capital Fund. President Obama authorized the Department of Energy to pursue a defense-only repository in 2015. Fees collected after the bill's enactment would be held in a Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration could access funds from the fund as needed for S. 854. The bill would repeal the current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 in 2013, with then-Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supporting the bill as a promising framework. NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd viewed the bill as a step in the right direction but urged continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. The bill S. 1240 was viewed as a promising framework by the Nuclear Waste Administration Commission and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd. However, concerns were raised by Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus regarding the bill allowing temporary waste storage facilities without progress on a permanent repository and inadequate state authority to regulate repository safety. S. 854 would require actions on a permanent repository before a nonpriority waste storage facility could be sited. S. 854 would require actions on a permanent repository before a nonpriority waste storage facility could be sited. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved initial funding for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011, which raised concerns about spent fuel storage and potential radioactive releases. House appropriations bills have not included authorization for nuclear waste storage, despite similar language in Senate bills. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 raised concerns about spent fuel storage and potential radioactive releases. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 would require NRC to maintain safety and security requirements at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage. NRC released a study in 2013 stating that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. Radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials with varying levels of radioactivity. Some waste decays quickly, while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Major types include spent nuclear fuel, which are fuel rods withdrawn from a reactor after irradiation. The implementation costs of expedited transfer to dry cask storage may not be justified due to limited safety benefits. Spent nuclear fuel, also known as used nuclear fuel, is highly radioactive waste containing fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. High-level waste is the residue from spent fuel reprocessing, with most uranium and plutonium removed for reuse. High-level waste from spent fuel reprocessing contains radioactive fission products, requiring isolation for 10,000 years. Transuranic waste, generated mainly by nuclear weapons production, contains long-lived elements like plutonium and requires radiation shielding. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for transuranic waste. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for transuranic waste, which contains long-lived elements like plutonium. Low-level waste, not classified as high-level waste or transuranic waste, has relatively low concentrations of radioactivity that decays relatively quickly. Low-level waste disposal facilities cannot accept material that exceeds NRC concentration limits. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from processing uranium ore with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards like radon emissions or groundwater contamination. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, posing institutional problems due to regulation by DOE or NRC under the Atomic Energy Act. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies containing metal-clad fuel rods. The fuel rods initially contain enriched uranium, but after nuclear fission, most of the U-235 nuclei have split. After nuclear fission in a reactor, spent fuel rods contain highly radioactive fission products, including plutonium. The spent fuel is stored in water pools near reactors to prevent overheating and then transferred to dry canisters for long-term storage. The NRC mandates a cooling period of 7-10 years before transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities. The NRC mandates a cooling period of 7-10 years before transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities. Spent fuel discharged from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at various sites, with about 80,000 metric tons stored at U.S. nuclear plants by the end of 2017. This includes approximately 30,000 metric tons in dry casks, exceeding the NWPA's 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. The recent report estimates that 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel were stored at U.S. nuclear plants by the end of 2017, with 30,000 metric tons in dry casks. The total amount of waste exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, and DOE estimates that eventually 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel may require disposal. Additional storage capacity will be needed if a permanent repository is not opened or alternative disposal technology is not developed. DOE's estimates show 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel from U.S. reactors may need disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted. Concerns about terrorist attacks and overheating of spent fuel have been raised. NRC report warned of potential fire hazard from overheating. The NRC and NAS reports raised concerns about the possibility of terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools, leading to overheating and potential fires. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the risk of fires. The nuclear industry suggests that uncovered spent fuel in pools would take several hours to catch fire, allowing time for alternative cooling measures. The NRC task force recommended ensuring electrical power and water spray systems for spent fuel pools. NRC also mandated improved water-level monitoring equipment for U.S. reactors' spent fuel pools in 2012. The NRC mandated improved water-level monitoring equipment for U.S. reactors' spent fuel pools in 2012. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to commercial disposal sites in 2017. Volumes and radioactivity can vary widely based on nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. Low-level radioactive waste is divided into three major categories for handling and disposal: Class A, B, and C. The radioactivity of low-level waste is a small fraction of spent fuel discharges. Low-level waste is classified as Class A, B, or C for disposal. Most Class B and C waste has been stored on-site since 2008 due to lack of permanent disposal. States can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste, while spent fuel disposal is a federal responsibility. Yucca Mountain is the only candidate site for highly radioactive waste disposal. The Trump Administration plans to revive the Yucca Mountain repository. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository after FY2010, but it remains the sole candidate site for civilian highly radioactive waste disposal. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding requests for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. DOE issued an alternative waste management strategy in 2013, calling for a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent fuel. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The fee for the program can be adjusted by the Secretary of Energy based on projected total costs. DOE was required to select three candidate sites for the first national high-level waste repository.

DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The fee for the program can be adjusted by the Secretary of Energy based on projected total costs. DOE was required to select three candidate sites for the first national high-level waste repository. After controversy, the act was modified by the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, designating Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. The 1987 amendments also authorized construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste. The law forbids DOE from selecting a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) site until recommending a permanent repository be constructed. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred waste management functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future developed a new waste management strategy, issuing its final report in January 2012. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on roles and responsibilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on roles and responsibilities. The commission highlighted the U.S. experience with the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico as a successful example of this approach. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new waste management program involving a federally chartered corporation with assured access to funds and congressional oversight. The program aims to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim central storage facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new waste management program involving a federally chartered corporation with assured access to funds and congressional oversight. The program aims to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim central storage facilities. In response, the DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in January 2013, which includes plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021. The DOE's strategy for managing nuclear waste includes plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale interim storage facility by 2025. The strategy aims to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository, but current restrictions make it difficult to build the facility. The DOE recommends not overly restricting progress on storage facilities linked to a permanent repository.

The strategy aims to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository. The DOE recommends not overly restricting progress on storage facilities linked to a permanent repository, with a geologic disposal facility planned to open by 2048. Sites for the repository and storage facilities would be selected through a \"consent based\" process, but details on implementation are lacking. The DOE's strategy for managing nuclear waste includes plans for interim storage facilities by 2021 and 2025, with a geologic disposal facility planned to open by 2048. The Obama Administration's proposed waste program involved consulting with Congress and interest groups on defining consent and codifying it. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in the 114th Congress to modify the waste program in line with the Administration's strategy. Other proposals have suggested privatizing waste management services. The DOE's 2014 report recommended testing a consent-based approach for siting a separate repository solely for defense and research waste, diverging from the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both civilian and defense waste. This proposal could expedite development due to the smaller volume of defense and research waste compared to civilian waste. The DOE's 2014 report recommended a separate repository for defense and research waste, diverging from the long-standing policy of a single repository for all waste. President Obama authorized planning for an underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities, but faced criticism and delays. He also blocked a preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain by establishing the Basin and Range National Monument in Nevada. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, leading to criticism of the defense-only repository plan. Waste Control Specialists applied for an NRC license for a storage facility in Texas, citing high licensing costs. They later formed a joint venture with Orano USA and submitted a renewed application in 2018. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) faced high licensing costs for a storage facility in Texas, leading to a joint venture with Orano USA. The proposed facility at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, would consist of dry casks on concrete pads with a total capacity of 40,000 metric tons. The Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to spent fuel from nuclear plants, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions, funded through the Nuclear Waste Fund. Under the Waste Control Specialists (WCS) proposal, the Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to a storage facility in Texas, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS argues that a privately developed storage facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions. Another storage facility application was filed in New Mexico by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) is planning to build a storage facility near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. New Mexico officials have shown support for the project, but state senators are opposed to an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. Governor Susana Martinez expressed support for ELEA's efforts in a letter to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) received support from Governor Susana Martinez for their storage facility project near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. However, state senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich oppose an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. Public support in New Mexico may be affected by a radioactive release from WIPP in February 2014. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa in 2017 aims to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa authorizes DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to the private storage facility. Annual interest earned by the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. The bill has 33 cosponsors as of August 31, 2018, including 14 from Texas. provisions for a private-sector MRS facility are included in another bill (H.R. 3053) approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on June 28, 2017. A private spent fuel storage facility project was initiated in 1996 on tribal land in Utah, but faced challenges from the Department of the Interior in 2006. The project aimed to store up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks, but was ultimately disapproved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs due to concerns over tribal trust lands. In 2006, the Department of the Interior rejected the PFS project due to concerns over waste storage and transportation. A federal lawsuit was filed in 2007 to challenge the decisions, leading to a court order in 2010 for the Interior Department to reconsider. However, PFS eventually requested to terminate its license in 2012. The Department of the Interior was ordered to reconsider its decisions on PFS permits in 2010. PFS later requested to terminate its license in 2012. The Obama Administration attempted to redirect the nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste disposal. NWPA mandates that high-level waste repositories meet EPA and NRC standards. Transport of waste is regulated by NRC and DOT. DOE shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must comply with NWPA guidelines. The NWPA mandates that high-level waste repositories must meet EPA and NRC standards. Transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by NRC and DOT. Shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC requirements, as well as follow DOT regulations. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include compliance with EPA's standards and establishing procedures for seeking a repository license. DOE must receive construction authorization before being issued a license to bring nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. The DOE needs a construction authorization for the Yucca Mountain repository before obtaining a license to store nuclear waste underground. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were required to meet radiation dose limits recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences recommended Yucca Mountain environmental standards to limit risk to individuals near the repository, rather than specific limits on radioactive material releases. EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual doses for the first 10,000 years. The EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the first 10,000 years. The final standards, issued in 2001, included a 15 millirem overall exposure limit. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards in 2001, including a 15 millirem overall exposure limit. Despite opposition, the DOE determined the site could meet the standards. The NRC revised its regulations to align with the EPA standards in 2001. A court panel in 2004 struck down the 10,000-year compliance period in the standards, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. The court ruled that the 10,000-year compliance period in the Yucca Mountain standards was inconsistent with the NAS study. In response, EPA proposed new standards in 2005, keeping dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing higher doses from 10,000 to 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standards as too lenient. EPA issued a final rule in 2008 amending the Yucca Mountain standards, reducing the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The 4 millirem groundwater standard will only apply to the first 10,000 years. NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to align with the new EPA standards in April 13. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to align with new EPA standards in April 13, 2009. DOE estimated in its June 2008 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Yucca Mountain repository that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems, significantly lower than previous estimates. The FSEIS attributed the reduction in nuclear waste management to changes in DOE's computer model and assumptions, with potential challenges in the NRC licensing process. DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on various technologies for spent nuclear fuel management, including the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed $88.5 million for waste processing but eliminated funding for the Obama strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management activities. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes reduced funding for waste disposal R&D and zero funding for integrated waste management, in contrast to the Obama Administration's strategy. The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides. Nuclear utilities previously paid fees to cover disposal costs, but DOE cannot spend the $37.2 billion in the Waste Fund without Congressional appropriation. The Nuclear Waste Fund had fees collected for civilian nuclear spent fuel disposal costs until halted in 2014. The fund balance was $37.2 billion by the end of FY2017. $7.41 billion had been spent on the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted in 2010. The total cost of the program was estimated at $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars. The Yucca Mountain program was estimated to cost $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. States handle low-level radioactive waste disposal under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for disposal. Three commercial waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their compacts after 1992. One site in Nevada closed, leaving two in South Carolina and Washington using their authority to prohibit waste from outside their compacts. The Yucca Mountain program was estimated to cost $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. States handle low-level radioactive waste disposal under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Three commercial waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their compacts after 1992. One site in Nevada closed, leaving two in South Carolina and Washington using their authority to prohibit waste from outside their compacts. Another site in Utah is available nationwide for most Class A low-level waste, while a new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, may alleviate storage issues for Class B and C waste. The Texas site received its first shipment of waste from Vermont on April 27, 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact, originally including Maine and Vermont, was signed by President Clinton on September 20, 1998. Texas Governor Rick Perry authorized the licensing of disposal facilities for low-level waste in 2003. Waste Control Specialists LLC filed an application to build the Andrews County disposal facility in 2004, which was approved by TCEQ in 2009. The Andrews County disposal facility in Texas was approved in 2009 after an application was filed in 2004 by Waste Control Specialists LLC. The Barnwell disposal facility in South Carolina accepts low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes Connecticut, New Jersey, and South Carolina. South Carolina can limit the use of the facility to compact members only. The Barnwell disposal facility in South Carolina phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by June 30, 2008. South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1995 and began accepting waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina also withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal did not subject it to sanctions under the compact. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact did not result in sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other disposal facility for low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing of low-level waste facilities is regulated by NRC or agreement states approved by NRC, following environmental and radiation protection guidelines. Transport of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to its disposal regulations. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final versions submitted for commission approval in 2016. Further revisions were issued in 2017, establishing time periods for technical analyses of waste sites to ensure long-term protection. Compliance periods of 1,000 years are required for sites without significant radioactive material, and 10,000 years for sites with such material. The NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final versions submitted in 2016. Compliance periods of 1,000 years are required for sites without significant radioactive material, and 10,000 years for sites with such material. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, with concerns about spent fuel storage safety heightened. Spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants must be stored on-site indefinitely, raising public concern near proposed reactor sites. Safety concerns about spent fuel storage have increased since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in March 2011. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama's actions to terminate the project have halted most activities in the DOE waste program. Congress is debating the project's future, with the NRC staff finding in October 2014 that the Yucca Mountain site would meet NRC standards after the repository was filled and sealed. The debate over the future of the Yucca Mountain project continues, with the Trump Administration proposing to restart licensing. Senator Reid's retirement may impact legislative action on nuclear waste. The Administration requested $120 million for licensing and storage in FY2018, citing national security and reducing taxpayer burden. Funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. The Trump Administration is pushing to accelerate progress on addressing nuclear waste and enhancing national security. Yucca Mountain funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors may seek damages from the federal government due to disposal delays, with potential liabilities estimated at $34.1 billion. The nuclear industry warns of future damages rising by tens of billions more if the disposal program fails. The nuclear industry faces potential liabilities of up to $34.1 billion due to disposal delays. Future damages could increase by tens of billions more if the federal disposal program fails. The lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could impact licensing for new nuclear plants and compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options such as centralized interim storage, continued storage at existing sites, reprocessing, and developing alternative repository sites. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options for nuclear waste disposal in January 2012, including centralized interim storage, continued storage at existing sites, reprocessing, and developing alternative repository sites. A congressionally chartered corporation was suggested to oversee the siting process for new waste storage facilities. The \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process has gained interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. The FY2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill and other legislation have attracted serious interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas for nuclear waste disposal. Previous voluntary siting efforts faced challenges from potential host states, highlighting the importance of state cooperation for any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort. The Blue Ribbon Commission's report in January 2012 and Government Accountability Office's findings on high-level nuclear waste disposal are relevant to current nuclear waste issues. The curr_chunk provides links to reports on current nuclear waste issues, including the economics of reprocessing vs. direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel, commercial spent nuclear fuel, and technical issues associated with the development of a separate repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.
