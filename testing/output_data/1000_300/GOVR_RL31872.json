    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator. They can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. UAVs are either single air vehicles with surveillance sensors or part of a UAV system (UAS) consisting of multiple air vehicles, a ground control station, and support equipment. The military has used UAVs in recent conflicts such as Iraq and Afghanistan. UAVs, whether single air vehicles or part of a UAV system, have been used in recent military conflicts like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. They offer advantages over manned aircraft such as eliminating pilot risk and having capabilities not limited by humans. UAVs are cost-effective and can perform \"3-D\" missions that are dull, dirty, or dangerous. The use of UAVs in military conflicts offers advantages over manned aircraft, such as eliminating pilot risk and performing \"3-D\" missions. Despite their lower procurement cost, UAVs have a higher crash risk and pose dangers when sharing airspace with manned assets. The recent growth in UAV employment is attributed to advancements in navigation and communication technology, as well as a shift in preference towards unmanned aviation. The use of UAVs in military conflicts has increased due to advancements in technology and a shift towards unmanned aviation. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, with the United States first testing them during the Vietnam War. The Israeli Air Force pioneered several UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s, which were eventually integrated into the US UAV inventory. The Israeli Air Force introduced UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s, which were later integrated into the US UAV inventory. This led to increased interest in UAVs within the Pentagon, with the Reagan Administration requesting higher levels of funding in 1987. The acquisition of UAVs from Israel, such as the Pioneer, proved valuable during Operation Desert Storm, showcasing the tactical intelligence capabilities of UAVs. Post-Gulf War, the potential of UAVs was recognized, leading to the rapid development of the Air Force's Predator UAV with new capabilities. The Pioneer UAV was utilized by Navy battleships during Operation Desert Storm to locate Iraqi targets. Post-Gulf War, the Air Force's Predator quickly gained new capabilities and debuted in the Balkans conflict for surveillance missions. Operations in Afghanistan featured the Global Hawk and armed reconnaissance missions by the Predator. Currently, the US inventory includes five major UAVs: Pioneer, Global Hawk, Predator, Hunter, and Shadow. Congressional support for UAVs has led to increased annual investment, with approximately FY2001 investment in UAVs. Investment in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been increasing annually, with Congress showing support for UAVs. The Pentagon requested $1.6 billion for UAV procurement and development in FY2006. Congress has directed the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' UAV programs and has required a UAV roadmap from the Department of Defense to address concerns about the future of UAVs. Congress has advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs, with support for weaponizing Predator and Hunter drones. There is confidence in UAV technology, with a prediction that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft will be unmanned within ten years. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, expanding the scope of missions and applications. The Act for Fiscal Year 2001 mandated that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft be unmanned within ten years. The development of UAVs has accelerated, raising questions about cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability. Congress may assess DOD's UAV efforts to ensure alignment with new investment goals. The cost-effectiveness of UAVs compared to manned aircraft is a key consideration. The cost-effectiveness and versatility of UAVs compared to manned aircraft are being questioned. Analysts suggest that unmanned aerial platforms could potentially take over many missions currently carried out by manned aircraft. Congress may need to consider replacing a significant portion of manned aircraft with yet-to-be-designed unmanned aircraft. The defining characteristic of UAVs is their unmanned nature. The potential replacement of manned aircraft with unmanned aircraft raises concerns about personnel issues, recruitment, retention, and the impact on the industrial base. The deployment of UAVs in large numbers could have implications for military personnel and the skills needed for manned aircraft design. The debate over whether UAVs will replace manned aircraft in the future also involves considerations about the industrial base. The development and proliferation of unmanned aircraft raise concerns about the erosion of skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design. There is a debate over whether UAVs will replace manned aircraft in the future, with some focusing on the industrial base issue while others argue for the continued need for manned aircraft to combat future threats. Congress may need to consider balancing support for legitimate U.S. exports with controlling the spread of UAV technologies to dangerous groups or countries. The diversity of UAV designs and applications is increasing, prompting a need for evaluation of UAV management. The development and proliferation of unmanned aircraft raise concerns about the erosion of skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design. Congress may need to consider balancing support for legitimate U.S. exports with controlling the spread of UAV technologies to dangerous groups or countries. UAVs are being developed, procured, and fielded in growing numbers with a diversity of designs and applications. Congress may wish to evaluate the management of UAVs, including the speed of development, appropriate plans, and structure for incorporating UAVs into future military capabilities. UAV programs range from combat-tested to not yet tested, with varying sizes and ranges. Figure 1 shows the evolution of UAVs and recent initiation of several UAV programs. The evolution of UAVs is evident in the increasing diversity of designs and applications, with a significant growth in inventory from 163 unmanned aircraft in February 2003 to 604 UAVs in 2005. This includes 2nd generation derivatives like Predator B and I-Gnat-ER, as well as non-traditional vehicles such as Snow Goose, Onyx, and Neptune. The Global Hawk, with a combat radius of 5,400 nm, exemplifies the advancements in UAV capabilities. The increase in DoD's UAV inventory is largely due to rising demand for UAVs to conduct various missions beyond typical ISR applications. Predator B has strike capability, and many Predator As have been modified to carry weapons. The Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program is also mentioned. The DOD's UAV research and development funding has increased significantly, driven by the growing demand for UAVs to perform a wide range of missions beyond traditional ISR applications. This growth is supported by the affordability of UAV production and advancements in miniaturization technology. Funding for UAV R&D in FY2006 exceeds total procurement funding, indicating a continued trend towards accelerated acquisition of UAVs. The DOD's UAV research and development funding has increased significantly due to the demand for UAVs for various missions. R&D funding in FY2006 for UAVs is more than double the total procurement funding, suggesting continued accelerated acquisition. Despite the growth in UAV production, manned aircraft still make up 95% of all DoD aircraft, indicating UAVs are more likely to complement manned aircraft rather than replace them. The pace of UAV production is expected to continue or even accelerate in the future. The Defense Science Board recommends accelerating the introduction of UAVs into the force structure. Air Force plans include a massive introduction of UAV technology in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. General John Jumper indicated a faster pace of production for UAVs, specifically the Predator. The Defense Science Board recommends speeding up UAV introduction into the force structure, with a focus on the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. General John Jumper emphasized the need for increased production of UAVs, particularly the Predator, to meet demand. Congress has urged the Department of Defense to accelerate UAV acquisition and capabilities, setting ambitious goals for unmanned deep strike aircraft by a certain timeframe. The Senate expressed a desire for one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft to be unmanned within ten years. In 1996, the House supported weaponizing the Predator and Hunter drones, but DoD opposed it. Some in Congress advocate for increased use of UAVs for non-military roles, while others are concerned about DoD's growing enthusiasm leading to uncertainty about the future of UAVs. Some critics are concerned about the ambitious pace of DoD's UAV programs, fearing it could impact quality and efficiency. Representative Curt Weldon warns against prematurely fielding new vehicles without addressing fundamental issues like common communication architecture and operational standards. Some services are purchasing expensive UAVs without proper authorization or appropriations, while others are leasing UAV services for combat operations using maintenance funds. This lack of oversight has led to UAV projects being hidden within larger program requests, exemplified by the rushed production schedule and funding strategy of the Global Hawk. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to a crowded production schedule and aggressive funding strategy, leading to technology immaturity. A report suggests a need to slow down production and make management changes to maintain quality. Some argue that the rapid pace is necessary, citing past successes with other UAV programs like the Hunter and Predator. The rapid production pace of UAVs like the Hunter and Predator has shown efficiency and quality. Congress is concerned about taxpayer spending on UAV programs and has implemented measures to ensure oversight on procurement. Congressional focus may also be on evaluating the effectiveness of DoD's administrative processes for UAV development and acquisition. One crucial Congressional task may be to determine if DoD's administrative processes for UAV development and acquisition are effective, given the heightened attention on management of DoD's acquisition programs. There is a call for centralization of UAV acquisition authority to prevent duplication of effort and ensure unity of effort. The potential for duplication of effort in UAV acquisition has led to calls for centralization of authority to prevent wasteful duplication. However, concerns exist that too much centralization may stifle competition and innovation. Cost issues are also a concern, with some UAVs rivaling manned aircraft in cost, such as the GlobalHawk program costing $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft. The GlobalHawk program has seen cost growth due to factors like mission creep and inconsistent management practices. Adding multiple sensors has driven up costs, as it requires larger wings and more powerful engines. Originally intended for one primary sensor, the UAV now carries a mix of sensors. The Global Hawk program has seen cost growth due to factors like mission creep and inconsistent management practices. Adding multiple sensors has driven up costs, as it requires larger wings and more powerful engines. Originally intended for one primary sensor, the UAV now carries a mix of sensors, increasing the price. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has evolved into a large, long-range aircraft with a heavy payload, leading to increased costs. The DoD has cut over $1 billion from the JUCAS budget and shifted management from DARPA to the Air Force, potentially impacting the total number of aircraft to be procured and increasing the cost per aircraft. The management of UAV programs has undergone various changes over the years, with responsibilities shifting between different organizations within the Department of Defense. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) budget has been reduced by over $1 billion, leading to potential impacts on the number of aircraft to be procured and increasing the cost per aircraft. The frequent changes in management and realignment of organizations involved in UAV development highlight the challenges in establishing a comprehensive UAV management system. The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) was established in 1993 to manage airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAVs, but faced criticism and was disbanded in 1998. Congress expressed serious reservations about the management of UAV programs by the joint program office, leading to calls for a comprehensive review by the Secretary of Defense. DARO's problems, redesigns, and accidents with the systems it developed raised questions about the legitimacy of the criticism and possible bias from advocates of manned aviation. Since DARO's disbandment in 1998, there has been no centralized procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts. Oversight authority now lies with OASD(C3I), while program development and acquisition are managed by the military services. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force was established in 2001 by OSD to enhance joint coordination of UAV programs and standardize payload development. The OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001 to standardize payload development and promote a common vision for future UAV efforts. The task force, under the authority of the Pentagon's acquisition chief, has published three UAV Roadmaps to help achieve a common UAV vision. The UAV Task Force was created to standardize payload development and promote a common vision for future UAV efforts. Despite concerns from Congress about UAV acquisition management, program duplication, and interoperability, the task force published three UAV Roadmaps. In addition to the task force, other management mechanisms have been initiated, such as the U.S. Joint Forces Command leading experimentation in UAV interoperability and flexibility. In 2003, the U.S. Joint Forces Command took the lead in experimenting with UAV interoperability and flexibility. The DoD also established the UAV Interoperability Working Group for joint-service and international cooperation. The Joint Requirement Oversight Council created a UAV Special Studies Group to advise on UAV issues. OSD was considering appointing one of the services as the executive agent for UAV coordination. In 2005, OSD considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later abandoned the idea in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) addresses major interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence enhances UAV applications through technology examination. The Joint UAV Center of Excellence coordinates with the OIPT to improve interoperability and enhance UAV applications through the examination of sensor technologies, intelligence collection assets, system technologies, training, and tactics. Recent management initiatives aim to increase system uniformity and interoperability, with the establishment of two organizations by JROC for joint coordination of production. Concerns over UAV management have risen due to constant organizational changes, indicating a lack of a final UAV development and oversight structure. The establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE is seen as a step in the right direction, but not a final solution. The DoD has not finalized a UAV development and oversight structure. The Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE are seen as steps in the right direction following criticism from the GAO for lacking oversight in UAV development efforts. The GAO envisioned a central authority for this role, but DoD's intended purpose may differ. The GAO envisioned a central authority for oversight in UAV development, but DoD's intended purpose may differ. Questions may arise over where the final management authority resides - within oversight bodies or with each service. Congress may need to address these issues in the future. The GAO raised questions about the final management authority for UAV development, potentially leading to Congress addressing these issues in the future. The Joint UAV Task Force has released roadmaps outlining future roles, technological progress, and investment needs for UAVs. The GAO previously called for a strategic plan from the Department of Defense to clarify inter-service goals and investment for UAVs. In March 2005, the GAO urged the Department of Defense to establish a strategic plan for UAVs, citing the 2002 Roadmap's failure to outline goals and investment priorities. The 2005 UAS Roadmap reiterates this mandate, focusing on providing guidance for standards development and interoperability solutions, without authorizing specific UAS or prioritizing requirements. It identifies future technology windows to enable new capabilities based on warfighters' needs. The 2005 UAS Roadmap provides guidance for standards development and interoperability solutions, without authorizing specific UAS or prioritizing requirements. It identifies future technology windows to enable new capabilities based on warfighters' needs, which may generate significant debate on future UAV management. Congress may revisit GAO recommendations to evaluate the Roadmap mandate for integrating UAVs into warfighting capabilities. The 2005 UAS Roadmap guides standards development and interoperability for UAV integration into warfighting capabilities. Congress plays a role in arbitrating competing UAV investments and maximizing resources. Key questions include quantifying UAV cost, balancing spending between UAVs and manned aircraft, and maximizing UAV capabilities through strategic investments. The UAV community faces challenges in quantifying and characterizing cost efficiency, with flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost being key measurements. Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment and program management, while PAUC is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by. The UAV community faces challenges in quantifying cost efficiency, with flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost being key measurements. The difference between Global Hawk's flyaway cost and PAUC demonstrates a wide cost gap. UAVs operate as part of a system, including ground control stations, ground crews, communication links, and other air vehicles. When comparing remotely piloted vehicles to manned aircraft like an F-16, the cost analysis must include supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Budgeting for UAVs can be complex due to different account placements in service budgets. The Army includes UAV funding requests in \"Other Procurement, Army,\" while the Air Force places them in the \"Aircraft Procurement\" account. UAV costs for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance missions are covered in the Intelligence budget, complicating cost analysis. Congress may need to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft as UAV funding trends upward. The US military is projected to have spent over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, far exceeding the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. Funding for UAV programs is expected to increase, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System budget breaking $1 billion by FY2011. The Presidential Budget Requests for the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System is expected to exceed $1 billion by FY2011, indicating a potential increase in UAV funding by the Department of Defense. UAV funding is projected to remain under 10% of total military aviation spending, representing only three percent of all military aviation funding. Critics argue that while unmanned aircraft offer cost savings in acquisition, the overall expenses may not be significantly lower due to the need for ground control stations and trained UAV operators. Additionally, UAVs have higher attrition and lower reliability rates compared to manned aircraft. The cost comparison between manned and unmanned aircraft shows that while UAVs may have lower acquisition costs, the overall expenses can be similar due to higher maintenance and operation costs. UAVs also have higher attrition rates and lower reliability compared to manned aircraft. The cost comparison between manned and unmanned aircraft shows that while UAVs may have lower acquisition costs, the overall expenses can be similar due to higher maintenance and operation costs. DoD faces the challenge of balancing cost with capability, with concerns over rising price tags of some UAVs. Members of the House Armed Services Committee have expressed concerns over cost growth of high-tech UAVs like Global Hawk. In a March 9, 2005 hearing, members of the House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns over the rising cost of UAVs, including both high-tech and less technologically ambitious ones. Former Air Force Secretary James Roche noted that sensors have significantly increased the cost of UAVs, with examples like Desert Hawk and Dragon Eye being overshadowed by the expensive cameras in their payloads. The sensor payload of the RQ-4 B Global Hawk represents a significant portion of the vehicle's cost. The rising cost of UAVs is mainly attributed to the expensive sensor payloads, which can represent a significant portion of the vehicle's flyaway cost. This increase in sensor costs is driven by growing demand and limited competition in the market. Some suggest equipping UAVs with self-protection devices to reflect their non-expendable nature. Two approaches to balancing cost and capability include deploying many smaller, interconnected UAVs or investing in more cost-effective options. Two schools of thought for UAV employment aim to balance cost with capability. One approach is to use many smaller, less expensive UAVs in a highly interconnected network, like the Army's Future Combat System. Another approach suggests deploying fewer, more expensive UAVs with higher capabilities, such as the Global Hawk. The Global Hawk, a high altitude surveillance platform, operates independently from other UAVs. Programs like the Army's Future Combat System and J-UCAS have faced delays and funding cuts due to management and technology issues. Key areas for investment in UAVs include interoperability, reliability, autonomy, and engine systems. The slow advancement of interoperability in UAVs is a pressing issue that could lead to funding cuts. Future plans require UAVs to communicate seamlessly with each other and ground components. The framework of larger battlefield operations and interconnected combat systems require UAVs to communicate seamlessly with each other and ground components. Lack of interconnectivity has complicated missions, reducing effectiveness. Advancing UAV interoperability is critical for the Department of Defense's investment plans. Advancing UAV interoperability is crucial for the Department of Defense's investment plans, aiming to establish inter-communication between similar UAVs to facilitate interoperability among different categories. This includes integrating interfaces for situational awareness, surveillance data transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815, House Report 109-89) included a clause requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness and targeting data. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Roadmap aims to equip all aerial vehicles with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness and targeting data. To achieve interoperability, investment in the Common Data Link communications system is crucial, as the finite bandwidth may limit the expansion of UAV applications. The expansion of UAV applications may be limited by the finite bandwidth available for military aircraft. The increased use of UAVs in recent wars highlights the need for a more robust information transfer system to support their bandwidth requirements. The military currently lacks sufficient bandwidth to download data from multiple UAVs simultaneously. Representative Curt Weldon has raised concerns about the underutilization of the extensive UAV fleet due to bandwidth limitations. The United States faces bandwidth limitations for utilizing its fleet of UAVs, leading to many sitting idle on the ground. In Iraq and Afghanistan, some UAVs are unable to operate due to insufficient information transfer capacity. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to address this issue by providing unlimited communication capabilities for the U.S. armed forces worldwide. The DoD's TSAT project aims to provide unlimited communication capabilities for the U.S. armed forces using laser and satellite technology. Funding cutbacks may delay deployment until 2015-2016. An interim solution involves using more autonomous UAVs to reduce bandwidth usage, but the effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. Operating UAVs from manned stand-off aircraft could help alleviate bandwidth issues. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs, with ongoing experimentation on controlling UAVs from manned stand-off aircraft to reduce bandwidth usage and reliance on satellites for communication. This approach also addresses pilot manpower and retention issues by allowing pilots to \"fly\" while operating the UAV. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs, with ongoing experimentation on controlling UAVs from manned stand-off aircraft to reduce bandwidth usage and reliance on satellites for communication. The Defense Science Board has highlighted the need for reliability upgrades to address high UAV mishap rates, which could impede widespread fielding. Mishap rates for UAVs are currently higher than those of many manned aircraft, prompting a focus on system design, weather durability improvements, and reliability upgrades to improve safety. The Defense Science Board notes that manned aircraft have improved safety over the years through system design, durability improvements, and reliability upgrades. However, UAVs, except for Predator, have lower total flight times than the 100,000 hours used to calculate mishap rates. Some UAVs like Predator and Global Hawk were rushed into combat before full development, making it unfair to compare their mishap rates with manned aircraft. The Defense Science Board notes that UAVs like Predator and Global Hawk were rushed into combat before full development, making it unfair to compare their mishap rates with manned aircraft. The DSB's report suggests that nominal upgrades and investments could substantially reduce UAV mishap rates, proposing investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing flight control systems and advanced materials for enhanced reliability. The incorporation of advanced materials and technologies, such as high temperature components and self-repairing flight control systems, aims to enhance the reliability and survivability of UAVs in adverse environments. One key technological priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously, reducing operator workload and increasing efficiency in UAV operations. The goal for UAV manufacturers is to reduce the operator-vehicle ratio to 2:1 and eventually allow one operator to control multiple vehicles. This advancement would enhance UAV autonomy and interoperability, potentially transforming combat capabilities. Achieving this goal would require significant time and investment in control technologies. Investing in control technologies is crucial for UAVs to work in teams, as noted in the 2005 UAS Roadmap. Improving autonomous flight capabilities can reduce operator workload. The GlobalHawk and Scan Eagle have automated flight capabilities, but their autonomy levels vary. The OSD rates UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, as shown in Table 3 of the UAS Roadmap 2005-2030. The OSD rates UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, with the Global Hawk currently at an ACL of 2.5. J-UCAS plans aim for an ACL of six in the future. Collaboration between the FAA, UAV industry, and DoD is ongoing to develop \"see and avoid\" technology for autonomous UAV operation. The FAA, UAV industry, and DoD are collaborating to develop \"see and avoid\" technology for autonomous UAV operation. Full automation of sensor capabilities would enable one operator to control a network of intelligence collecting drones, with advancements towards one operator controlling multiple UAVs already underway. The Air Force evaluated a Predator upgrade allowing one operator to pilot up to four UAVs using the Multi-Aircraft Control system. The Air Force evaluated a Predator upgrade that allowed one operator to pilot up to four UAVs using the Multi-Aircraft Control system. The next step is to consolidate the tasks of the four mission payload operators into one or fewer operators. Investment interest may focus on heavy fuel burning engines, with the development of heavy fuel engines being a top priority for UAV investment according to the OSD's Unmanned Aviation System Roadmap. The Defense Science Board urged DoD to invest in heavy fuel engines for UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout due to lack of commercial demand. The military has established the need for these engines, but industry has been slow to respond. Incorporating heavy fuel engines could improve UAV performance. The incorporation of heavy fuel engines onto UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Predator could enhance performance, reduce servicing time, and lower operations and maintenance costs. Heavy fuel is cheaper and more abundant than gasoline, making it a viable option for medium-sized and less complex UAVs. However, some drawbacks may exist when applying heavy fuel engines to UAVs. The use of heavy fuel engines on UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Predator could reduce costs and enhance performance. However, challenges exist in designing engines light and small enough for lighter UAVs. An alternative being considered is a modified fuel cell that could double efficiency and reduce detection and targeting risks. (79) Air Combat Command is sponsoring the project. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring a project to use fuel cells in smaller UAVs to increase efficiency and reduce detection risks. Questions arise about the DoD's plan for UAV roles and applications, and whether they are being applied aggressively enough. Considerations include whether to add missions to existing UAVs or develop new ones. Most UAVs are primarily used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. ISR applications vary from high altitude missions by the Global Hawk to sniper spotting by the Army's Raven UAV. The DoD's major UAV programs have shown diversification in missions, with a rapid growth in overall programs. The DoD's major UAV programs have shown diversification in missions, with a rapid growth in overall programs. Concerns arise about unnecessary duplication in production and the potential challenges of joint development due to differing service requirements. Congress questions the need for new UAVs with similar sensors, such as the Navy's maritime surveillance UAV compared to the Global Hawk. The Navy's need for a new maritime surveillance UAV is questioned by Congress, who wonders why they can't use the Global Hawk instead. Different ISR UAVs have similar sensors but vary in altitude, communications range, endurance, and takeoff/landing procedures. Congress may intervene to determine when a new UAV program is necessary or redundant. The performance specifications of ISR-capable UAVs show endurance of 4 to 8 hours, altitude of 10,000-20,000 ft, speeds between 105 and 125 knots, and radiuses of 100 to 150 nm. Critics question the necessity of producing multiple UAVs with similar performance capabilities, suggesting that a consolidated inventory of specific models could fulfill the same duties. However, proponents argue that the variety of UAVs reflects the specific needs of missions or users, rather than unnecessary duplication. In recent years, the role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased, with UAVs being used for combat operations since 2002. The UAV combat landscape has evolved, with various UAV models equipped with different munitions for specific mission needs. The UAV combat landscape has evolved with different models equipped with various munitions for specific mission needs. The cost comparison between MQ-9 Predator B and F-16 Falcon shows potential cost savings when using UAVs for combat operations. The cost analysis between the MQ-9 Predator B and F-16 Falcon reveals potential cost savings in using unmanned aircraft for combat operations. The F-16 has a higher payload capacity and versatility compared to the Predator B, suggesting that manned aircraft may be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat missions. UAVs may be more valuable in niche circumstances where manned aircraft are at risk. Using manned aircraft for air-to-ground combat may generally prove more cost-effective than using UAVs. UAVs' unique combat capabilities are most valued in niche circumstances where manned aircraft would be in extreme danger. UAVs are also useful for missions such as electronic attack, psychological operations, and delivering critical medical supplies on the battlefield. In addition to foreign theaters, UAVs are increasingly being considered for homeland defense and security missions by agencies like the Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol. Congressional support for UAV deployment is strong. Interest is growing in using UAVs for domestic roles such as homeland defense and security. The Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol plan to deploy UAVs for coastal waters surveillance and border protection. Congressional support exists for using UAVs like the Predator for border security. Domestic agencies could use UAVs for missions like long-duration law enforcement surveillance. The U.S. Department of Transportation has also studied potential security roles for UAVs. UAVs have various potential security roles, including long-duration law enforcement surveillance, following trucks with hazardous cargo, measuring radiation in the atmosphere, serving as small-package transport for local law enforcement, searching for forest fires in sparsely populated areas, and aiding in \"consequence management\" and relief efforts after disasters like Hurricane Katrina. Countries like South Korea and Japan have also utilized UAVs for various purposes. Some suggest that UAVs like Global Hawk could play roles in \"consequence management\" and relief efforts following disasters. Countries like South Korea and Japan have used UAVs for agricultural purposes. UAV advocates emphasize the need for FAA regulations to align with UAV flight requirements for homeland security. The FAA granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation in August 2003. The FAA granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation in August 2003, marking the first steps towards reconciling discrepancies in UAV-airspace common ground. Upgrading UAVs collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for safe operations. The FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group will collaborate with the Department of Defense to ensure safe UAV operations and flight requirements. The integration of UAVs into national airspace may face challenges, as highlighted in a February 2004 study by the Defense Science Board. The Defense Science Board highlighted challenges in integrating UAVs into national airspace, with concerns over funding for UAV programs and potential future roles in aerial refueling. Large UAVs could potentially take on the aerial refueling task currently performed by KC-10 and KC-135 tanker aircraft, a mission well suited for unmanned aircraft due to their benign flight profiles. The Global Hawk's trans-oceanic flights demonstrate the capability of current UAVs for similar missions. Additionally, there is potential for UAVs to be equipped for air-to-air combat in the future. The ability of current UAVs to perform aerial refueling missions has been demonstrated, with potential for future air-to-air combat capabilities. A Predator UAV reportedly engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This development, though in its early stages, shows promise for more aggressive missions for unmanned aircraft. The recent Predator launch of an air-to-air missile has shown potential for more aggressive missions for unmanned aircraft. Other options for these new roles include manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Defense contractors are developing unmanned blimps that can float at high altitudes for extended periods and carry heavy payloads. OSD's 2005 UAS Roadmap includes lighter-than-air blimps and tethered \"aerostat\" platforms for various roles. Lighter-than-air blimps and tethered \"aerostat\" platforms are important for various roles such as psychological operations, missile spotting, and border monitoring. These platforms could offer similar services to border surveillance UAVs with lower operational costs due to reduced fuel dependency. However, they lack maneuverability and speed compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Major UAV manufacturers aim to develop operational systems by 2010 for homeland security missions. Space satellites are considered relatively invulnerable to attack and offer advanced capabilities, although tasking them can be challenging. Space satellites are beneficial for homeland security missions but can be cumbersome to task due to competing priorities. Limited systems can only serve a certain number of customers at a time, and some lack loitering capability. High costs of space launches have led to consideration of UAVs like Global Hawk for communication relays. Concerns exist about UAV production replacing manned aircraft in large numbers, potentially degrading pilot skills. Critics warn that mass UAV production may replace manned aircraft, leading to concerns about degraded pilot skills and loss of tactical flexibility in combat operations. The Air Force is working to encourage pilots to see piloting UAVs as a major mission and to become trailblazers in defining new concepts of operations, realizing the retention implications of requiring rated pilots to fly UAVs. The Air Force is working hard to encourage pilots to view piloting UAVs as a significant mission and to be pioneers in shaping new operational concepts. They offer incentives such as desirable assignments and the opportunity to maintain manned flying hours during UAV duty. While concerns exist about the impact of UAV programs on recruitment and retention, the situation varies among the different military branches and personnel types. The impact of DoD's UAV programs on recruitment is complex. While the Army faces recruitment challenges, the Air Force and Navy are actively reducing uniformed personnel. The qualifications for UAV operators vary among services, with the Air Force requiring pilot-rated officers for Predator and Global Hawk operators. This reduces competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for pilots. The Air Force requires pilot-rated officers for UAV operators, reducing competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for pilots. Enlistees may be attracted to UAVs due to lack of physical qualifications for manned aircraft or the appeal of flying armed UAVs. Flying UAVs offers a compromise, avoiding some hardships of manned aircraft while still providing an opportunity to \"fly.\" The Air Force believes that flying UAVs from control stations in the United States will be attractive to some Reservists and Guardsmen who may already be disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft. Some UAVs, like the Global Hawk, are pre-programmed and operate autonomously, not requiring a pilot like the Predator. The Air Force maintains that their UAVs are more technologically and operationally sophisticated, requiring a trained pilot for effective employment. The Air Force's UAVs are technologically advanced and require trained pilots for effective operation. Congress may reconsider the policy of pilot-rated officers operating UAVs as autonomy improves. Increased UAV use could attract recruits by offering improved force protection and combat capabilities. Congress faces defense industrial base issues regarding foreign dependency and subsidies for competitors. The potential hazards of combat may be less concerning for recruits interested in UAVs. Congress grapples with defense industrial base issues, including foreign dependency and subsidies for competitors. The DoD's pursuit of UAVs raises concerns about funding for manned aircraft programs and the erosion of technical expertise. The debate over the impact of UAV development on manned aircraft programs and the defense industrial base continues. Some argue that funding for manned aircraft programs may decrease, leading to a loss of technical expertise. Others believe that the industry is naturally evolving towards UAVs and that skills will not be lost. Concerns also exist about the future demand for manned aircraft post-JSF era. Some argue that the future of UAVs is overrated and there will still be a demand for manned aircraft post-JSF era. They believe that critical manned aircraft design skills are not jeopardized by increased pursuit of UAVs due to commonality in technology and requirements. Unmanned combat aircraft share similarities with manned aircraft in terms of stealth, avionics, and engines. Major defense contractors are transitioning to unmanned aircraft design to remain competitive, as UAVs are becoming more prominent in warfare. Companies like Boeing are exploring unmanned bombers and fighters for growth opportunities, while Northrop Grumman Corp. has established a new unit to focus on UAV business. Recent aviation contracts, such as Boeing and the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 2001, are shifting towards unmanned bombers and fighters for growth. Northrop Grumman Corp. has created a new business unit to aggressively pursue UAV business. The global UAV market is expanding, with an estimated doubling of expenditures from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. The global market for combat aircraft is much larger but projected to grow at a slower rate. The global market for combat aircraft is much larger than the UAV market, but the UAV market is projected to grow rapidly. Capturing new business in the UAV market is crucial for U.S. companies to remain competitive. The growth of UAVs also raises concerns about proliferation and export controls. The growth of UAVs presents policy concerns regarding proliferation and export controls. UAVs and cruise missiles are difficult to control due to their indistinguishable components from civil aviation, making diversion of technology into covert programs easy. This accessibility raises worries about potential use by various countries or non-state actors. The proliferation of UAVs and cruise missiles raises concerns about diversion of technology into covert programs, making them accessible to countries or non-state actors. There are fears that armed UAVs could be cost-effective weapons, posing a threat that is difficult and costly to defend against. The George W. Bush Administration expressed concerns about the military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands. The George W. Bush Administration has expressed concern over the potential military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands, especially in relation to Iraq's UAVs and their potential use in attacks with weapons of mass destruction. Foreign companies are gaining access to technologies that could enhance UAV capabilities, raising concerns about UAV proliferation and the need for policy measures to address the consequences. Some in Congress may want to address policy issues related to UAV proliferation as U.S. companies pursue international business opportunities. Concerns include preventing dissemination of critical UAV technologies and balancing military aid to allies with proliferation worries. UAVs can aid in identifying enemy combatants and reducing collateral damage, but overseers must weigh these benefits against potential acquisition by enemy groups. The section discusses the potential benefits of UAVs in identifying enemy combatants and reducing collateral damage. It also raises questions about how to balance these benefits with the risk of UAV proliferation to enemy groups. Additionally, it addresses the need for revisions to non-proliferation accords to control the spread of UAV technology effectively. The focus is on the status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense. The section focuses on small man-portable UAVs, which are distinct from larger UAV programs like Predator or Global Hawk. These smaller UAVs are not weaponized and do not receive as much congressional attention. However, they are popular with ground forces and are likely to compete with major UAV programs in the future.
