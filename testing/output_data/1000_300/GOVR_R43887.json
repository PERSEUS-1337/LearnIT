    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services and programs for individuals aged 60 and older. Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse. Most programs are administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services, except for Title V which is administered by the Department of Labor. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older. Title V is administered by the Department of Labor. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 2006. Funding for OAA Titles II, III, IV, VI, and VII comes from HHS appropriations, while Title V funding comes from DOL appropriations. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 (P.L. 109-365) authorized appropriations through FY2011. Despite the expiration of authorizations, Congress has continued to fund OAA programs. This report discusses OAA funding, including FY2015 funding breakdown, legislative activity, and funding decisions for selected programs. Appendix A details authorizations of appropriations under the 2006 Amendments. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Appendix A provides authorizations of appropriations under the 2006 Older Americans Act Amendments. Appendix B shows funding levels for OAA programs from FY2006 through FY2015. For more information on the Older Americans Act, refer to CRS Report R43414. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, slightly more than FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding at 70.7%, with allocations to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to other OAA programs. In FY2015, OAA programs received $1.878 billion in funding, slightly more than FY2014. Elder rights protection activities under Title VII received 1.1% of the funding. Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities under Title IV received new funding in FY2015 for Holocaust survivors and an Elder Justice Initiative. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, and increased annually from FY2006 to FY2010. Funding levels have remained below FY2010 levels since then. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, and increased annually from FY2006 to FY2010. Funding levels have remained below FY2010 levels since then, with a decline in funding from FY2011 through FY2013, mainly due to sequestration. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs declined from FY2011 to FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. The reduction in funding from FY2012 to FY2013 is mainly due to sequestration. Funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was slightly above FY2013 but below FY2012 levels. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, providing funding for aging and disability services programs administered by ACL. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions. In 2015, temporary government-wide funding was provided through several continuing resolutions, maintaining funding for discretionary Labor-HHS-Education programs at the same rate as in the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for a FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, but a bill was introduced to provide funding for Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. In September 2014, a bill was introduced to provide funding for OAA programs, including $448.3 million for OAA Title V (CSEOA) and $816 million for OAA Title III senior nutrition programs. The bill did not specify funding for other OAA programs and activities. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill in June 2014, proposing to fund OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to the FY2014 level. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill in June 2014, proposing to fund OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to the FY2014 level. The bill included a $5.5 million increase in family caregiver funding and a $5.9 million decrease in funding for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with funding levels mostly maintained from FY2014. Exceptions included $20.0 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, $25.0 million was requested for an \"Elder Justice Initiative.\" The FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. It also requested $25.0 million for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" under OAA Sections 451 and 751. The ACL Budget Justification did not specify funding amounts under OAA authority. Additionally, the budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. Differences in funding for selected OAA programs and issues were highlighted among various FY2015 budget proposals and final funding enacted under P.L. 113-235. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL to integrate with other aging services programs. This program provides part-time opportunities for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. Funding was also allocated for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and the White House Conference on Aging. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% to $380.0 million. The program targets unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older, aiming to integrate with other aging services programs. Of the 56 state and territorial grantees, 17 are in state labor departments, while the rest are in aging, senior services, or health and human services departments. The transfer to ACL aims to consolidate Federal oversight of the OAA under one department for streamlined operations. The transfer of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL aims to consolidate Federal oversight of the OAA under one department, streamlining operations. This transfer would require legislation from Congress to take effect. ACL would target the program to those with the greatest need, consider all sources of income for eligibility, and focus funds on areas with the potential for the largest impact. Additionally, ACL proposed restructuring CSEOA as a community service program. ACL proposed restructuring CSEOA as a community service program, targeting funds to areas with the potential for the largest impact. The Senate bill would have funded CSEOA at the FY2014 level, while H.R. 5464 would have allocated $448.3 million for the program under the DOL account. The subcommittee recommended keeping CSEOA in DOL with funding at $448.3 million for FY2015, matching FY2014 levels. P.L. 113-235 allowed 0.5% of the appropriation for program evaluation. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the U.S., with 25% in poverty. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, with matching private philanthropy dollars. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the U.S., with 25% in poverty. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund to provide supportive services. The Senate bill did not allocate funding for the Fund due to budget constraints, but urged prioritization within existing programs. FY2015 final funding included $2.5 million for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. The FY2015 funding did not establish the proposed Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund but included $2.5 million for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) aim to provide a single entry point for information on long-term services and supports, offering counseling, access to public programs, discharge planning, and care transition services. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide, with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. In FY2012, ADRCs had 5.2 million contacts with clients and received $10 million in mandatory funding under the ACA. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding for ADRCs but included $20.0 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding. Additional funding could help ADRC programs assist states in meeting needs. The budget justification highlighted the $100 million provided since 2003 for ADRC services and the potential for additional funding to support states in meeting Medicaid requirements. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged improved coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs. H.R. 5464 did not specify a dollar amount for ADRCs, but FY2015-enacted funding allocated $6.1 million in discretionary funding, the same as FY2014. The President's budget request for additional mandatory funding was not fulfilled. The White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused on concerns of older individuals and provided guidance to federal policymakers. The President's FY2015 budget requested $3.0 million for a White House Conference on Aging, but did not specify a dollar amount for ADRCs, which received $6.1 million in discretionary funding. The budget justification noted previous funding for ADRC services and the Senate bill proposed improved coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs. The White House Conference on Aging has been held in various decades, with the most recent one planned for 2015. While the President's budget proposed funding for the conference, the Senate bill did not allocate dedicated funding. The conference is expected to take place in Washington, DC, with a scaled-down scope due to lack of direct appropriations. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 will be held in Washington, DC with a scaled-down scope due to lack of direct appropriations. It will recognize the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act, focusing on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held throughout the year to gather input for the conference. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 will focus on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will gather input for the conference. Tables show authorizations of appropriations and funding history for Older Americans Act programs from FY2006 to FY2015."
