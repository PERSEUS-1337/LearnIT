    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a preparation made from living organisms, such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, cells, or tissues. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their reference brand-name drugs. Chemical drugs are synthesized via a chemical process and are chemically identical to their brand-name counterparts. They have a simpler molecular structure compared to biologics. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs, with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research overseeing traditional biologics. Biosimilar drugs like Inflectra, approved in 2016, are similar to brand-name biologics like Remicade. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) oversees traditional biologics, gene therapy products, cellular therapy products, and more. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Monoclonal antibodies are an example of therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER. In 2003, responsibility for regulating therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. CDER regulates monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes. Monoclonal antibodies like infliximab are used to treat various conditions. Cytokines help fight cancer and infections. Growth factors regulate cell division, and enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body. Biologics and biosimilars, such as growth factors and enzymes, require special handling and are often administered via injection or infusion. They may help the body fight cancer and other diseases by stimulating or suppressing the immune system. Biologics, also known as specialty drugs, are expensive medications that require special handling and are often administered via injection or infusion. The cost of some biologic medications can exceed $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, showing a 13% increase over the previous year. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics subject to biosimilar competition accounted for $3.2 billion, with $2.9 billion spent on original biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011, driving up Medicare Part B program costs. Spending on biologics grew by 13.3% annually from 2006 to 2014, accounting for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologics are more expensive in the US than in Europe and Canada, where biosimilars have reduced prices significantly. Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 to lower chemical drug prices and used a similar approach in 2010 for biologics. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug costs and expanding the generic drug industry. Generic medications can decrease prices by 60% to 90% compared to branded drugs. Generic drug companies save costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. The FDA must approve generic drugs as identical to the original product before marketing. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 lowered drug costs by allowing FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, which can decrease prices by 60% to 90% compared to branded drugs. Generic drug companies save costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. The FDA must approve generic drugs as identical to the original product before marketing, ensuring interchangeability with brand-name drugs and other generics. The biotechnology industry was also developing its first biologics for human therapeutic use during this time. During the implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the biotechnology industry introduced its first biologics for human therapeutic use. FDA approved human insulin (Humulin-R) in 1982, followed by human growth hormone (Protropin) in 1985, alpha interferon (Intron-A) in 1986, tissue plasminogen activator (Activase) in 1987, and erythropoietin (Epogen) in 1989. Biological products are regulated by FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The regulatory responsibility for chemical prescription drugs was transferred to the FDA in 1972. All drugs are regulated and approved for marketing under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not provide a mechanism for follow-on biologics. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for therapeutic biologics licensed under the PHSA. In 1941, Congress gave the FDA authority over the marketing of insulin, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Insulin and a few other natural source biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA, not as biologics under the PHSA. Insulin and a few other natural source biological products were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA, not as biologics under the PHSA. Besides insulin, other biological products regulated as drugs included glucagon, human growth hormone, hormones for infertility, menopause, osteoporosis, and certain medical enzymes. FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars even as patent protection for specialty biologic drug products was expiring. Some entities advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system for biosimilars approval. In contrast to the US, Europe had fewer barriers for marketing biosimilars. The European Medicines Agency authorized the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, in April 2006, followed by several others in subsequent years. In the United States, FDA approved Omnitrope in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used for approval. The FDA approved Omnitrope in 2006 using the 505(b)(2) pathway. Congress later established a new regulatory authority for biosimilar products in 2010. The FDA has the authority to approve biological products that are highly similar or interchangeable with FDA-licensed products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. This includes collecting user fees from industry. A biological product can be considered biosimilar if it is highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Interchangeability requires meeting a higher standard. The FDA can approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Interchangeability requires demonstrating the same clinical results as the reference product and a comparable risk profile. FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather industry and public perspectives. The FDA held public meetings in 2010 to gather perspectives on biosimilars. Subsequently, draft guidance documents were released in 2012, with final guidance issued in 2015. Additional guidance on biosimilars has also been released by the FDA. Companies must submit an application to the FDA under Section 351(k) of the PHSA to market a biosimilar product in the United States. Under Section 351(k) of the PHSA, a company must submit an application to the FDA for marketing a biosimilar product in the US. The application should demonstrate biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. FDA may determine if certain studies are unnecessary. Any changes to the manufacturing process require FDA approval to ensure product quality and safety. The FDA requires a demonstration of comparability for any changes to the manufacturing process of biologic products to ensure product quality and safety. This includes conducting chemical, physical, and biological assays to assess variability in biological products. FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the US, but sales of five have been delayed. The FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the US, but sales of five have been delayed due to actions of brand-name manufacturers. Patent infringement lawsuits and anticompetitive tactics have caused delays in the marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using exclusionary contracts to prevent insurers from covering Inflectra, impacting the sales of other biosimilars like Renflexis. The FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the US, but sales of five have been delayed due to actions of brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has sued Johnson & Johnson for using exclusionary contracts to prevent insurers from covering Inflectra, impacting the sales of other biosimilars like Renflexis. The high costs of pharmaceuticals, particularly biologics, have raised interest in the federal government's role in developing new therapeutics. Six of the seven biosimilars had their brand-name drugs discovered by scientists at public-sector research institutions. Several of these brand-name biologics are top-selling drugs globally and in the US. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar product in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen, discovered by scientists at Sloan Kettering. FDA also approved Inflectra in April 2016, a biosimilar to Remicade, made by Janssen Biotech, Inc. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, marketed by Pfizer at a lower price than the brand-name drug. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017 for alleged anticompetitive practices. In September 2017, Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for alleged anticompetitive practices related to exclusionary contracts with health insurers, blocking coverage for Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade. This was due to J&J threatening to withhold rebates unless insurers agreed to biosimilar-exclusion contracts. The rebate offered by brand-name manufacturers to insurers for patients on Remicade creates a financial incentive to prefer the higher-priced biologic over the biosimilar. This tactic, known as a \"rebate trap,\" involves withdrawing rebates on the branded biologic if the biosimilar manufacturer offers a significant price discount. This results in higher costs for patients on the branded biologic, even if the biosimilar is 60% cheaper. The rebate trap causes payer costs to double when rebates are withdrawn, even if the biosimilar is 60% cheaper. To avoid this trap, a near-complete switch from branded biologic to biosimilar is needed, but many chronic disease patients are already stable on current therapy. According to Pfizer's lawsuit, providers have been reluctant to purchase Inflectra, with only about 10% of health care providers using infliximab buying any Inflectra at all. Inflectra has secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the United States since its FDA approval in April 2016. J&J has raised the list price of Remicade by close to 9% and increased government reimbursements by over $190. Pfizer's lawsuit against J&J accuses them of anticompetitive practices to maintain dominance in the face of biosimilar competition. J&J's president claims they are competing on value and price, with Pfizer failing to demonstrate sufficient value to patients, providers, payers, and employers. In response to Pfizer's lawsuit, J&J claims they are competing on value and price, with Pfizer failing to show enough value to stakeholders. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, which is similar to Enbrel, a top-selling drug in the US. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, has been approved by the FDA. Clinical data confirms its similarity to the reference product. A release date for marketing has not been set due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz. The FDA has approved Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, based on its similarity to the reference product. A release date for marketing is pending due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz. Amjevita, another biosimilar to Humira, was also approved by the FDA. In 2002, Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA to market Humira. Amjevita was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Humira is a top-selling drug globally and in the United States. Amjevita may not be available commercially until at least 2018 due to patent infringement litigation. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, in April 2017. Remicade was originally discovered by scientists at New York University in 1998. In 1998, FDA licensed Remicade (infliximab) to Centocor Inc., later Janssen Biotech Inc. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the US, priced 35% lower than Remicade. FDA approved Cyltezo (adalimumab-adbm) in August 2017, a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) by Boehringer Ingelheim. Humira was discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps. Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA to market Humira in 2002. Cyltezo is a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) by Boehringer Ingelheim. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement, delaying Cyltezo's launch date. FDA approved Mvasi (bevacizumab-awwb) by Amgen, a biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab) by Genentech. Avastin is also a top-selling drug in the US. Genentech received FDA license to market Avastin (bevacizumab) in 2004, a top-selling drug in the US. The Purple Book lists licensed biological products with proprietary and nonproprietary names. The FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2017, using the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" due to PHSA nomenclature. The guidance provides rationale for naming convention for biosimilars. The FDA guidance on naming convention for biosimilars uses the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" in accordance with the PHSA. The nonproprietary name for each originator biological product, related biological product, and biosimilar product will consist of a core name and a distinguishing suffix of four lowercase letters. FDA is still considering the suffix format for interchangeable products. For originator biological products, FDA will use a core name designated by the USAN Council. The FDA guidance on naming convention for biosimilars uses a core name designated by the USAN Council. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. The WHO released the Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal for biosimilar naming in January 2016. \"The BQ is an additional element used with the INN to uniquely identify biological substances for prescription and pharmacovigilance. Biosimilar industry groups support nonproprietary names, while innovator companies prefer distinguishing names. The FDA's naming proposal raised concerns about physicians incorrectly perceiving differences between biosimilars and reference biologics, potentially deterring prescriptions.\" The FDA's naming proposal has raised concerns that physicians may incorrectly believe biosimilars differ significantly from reference biologics, potentially hindering market development and competition. Historically, all originator biologics with the same identification tests received the same nonproprietary name, indicating pharmacological and chemical relationship similarities. The FDA's proposal suggests using the same USAN for biosimilars and their reference biologics. The FDA's proposal for naming biosimilars has raised concerns about potential misunderstandings among physicians regarding the differences between biosimilars and reference biologics. Differences in nonproprietary names could lead to misconceptions about the level of similarity required between a biosimilar and its reference biologic. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is often misused to create fear and confusion, as biologics are inherently not identical but rather highly similar. The FTC workshop on biosimilars discusses how the term \"identical\" is misused to create fear and confusion among physicians. Biologics inherently have variability, even between batches of the same product. FDA-approved labeling for prescription drug products provides information on safety and effectiveness for healthcare providers to determine suitability for patients. FDA-approved labeling for prescription drug products is a compilation of information approved by the FDA, based on thorough analysis of the NDA or BLA. It contains necessary information for safe and effective use, written for healthcare practitioners. Labeling includes warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, and precautions. FDA requires labeling to start with a highlights section containing warnings and other essential information. This includes indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. FDA's draft guidance on biosimilar labeling suggests including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section to describe the relationship between the biosimilar and its reference product. The biosimilar is not mandated to have the same labeling as the reference product, and comparative data is recommended. The FDA recommends including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in biosimilar product labeling to describe its relationship to the reference product. The biosimilar is not required to have the same labeling as the reference product, and comparative data is available on the FDA website. Views on FDA labeling guidance vary, with the generic industry preferring less information while the brand-name industry wants more. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) believes the Biosimilarity Statement may be unnecessary and confusing to patients and healthcare providers. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) believes the Biosimilarity Statement may be unnecessary and confusing to patients and healthcare providers. In contrast, BIO, representing makers of brand-name pharmaceuticals, prefers more information in labeling to ensure transparency for prescribers. The BPCIA provision will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. The BPCIA provision will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. FDA released draft guidance regarding this provision in March 2016, stating that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with exceptions until March 23, 2020. The BPCI Act states that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with exceptions until March 23, 2020. An application may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act by that date if certain criteria are met. The FDA's interpretation states that approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act will be deemed licenses under the PHS Act as of March 23, 2020. Applications approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA. FDA will not approve any pending applications under the FD&C Act for biological products subject to transition provisions after March 23, 2020. It is suggested that these applications be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA. Some industry representatives have expressed concerns about potential delays due to this policy change. The FDA suggests withdrawing and resubmitting applications under the PHSA, which may delay the approval of biosimilar products. Exclusivity associated with approved NDAs for biological products would cease to have effect, except for orphan drug exclusivity which would still apply after March 23, 2020. The FDA policy on exclusivity for orphan drugs continues after March 23, 2020, raising legal and trade issues for industry groups. Transitional biological products are not eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period under the BPCIA. The FDA states that the BPCIA does not grant exclusivity to biological products approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, which could impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition until 2032. Interchangeable products can produce the same clinical result as the reference product and may be substituted by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. The FDA allows interchangeable products to be substituted by pharmacists without the need for a healthcare provider's intervention. Biosimilars are not structurally identical to their brand-name counterparts, requiring a separate assessment for interchangeability. FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with no approved interchangeable product yet. In Europe, the EMA does not have a similar process for interchangeability. Assessing interchangeability is a separate process. FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not approved an interchangeable product yet. In Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not determine interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policies on interchangeability, with countries like Denmark considering all originators and biosimilars interchangeable unless proven otherwise, while Ireland allows a single switch but not multiple switches. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies. At least 37 states have considered legislation for biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This agreement between FDA, industry, and Congress established performance goals and specified that the revenue from user fees would support the review of new product applications. The added resources from user fees allowed FDA to increase staff for application reviews and reduce review times. Congress has since expanded this authority to include medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This agreement allowed FDA to increase staff for application reviews and reduce review times. Congress has expanded this authority to include medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews from October 2012 through September 2017. The BsUFA I program started with fees for biosimilar products in development to generate revenue and assist industry sponsors. As of February 2017, there were 64 BPD programs developing separate biosimilar products. Companies can discontinue participation but would need to pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for small businesses. FY2017 fee rates under BsUFA I are shown. The FDA's Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) program started with fees for biosimilar products in development to assist industry sponsors. Companies can discontinue participation but would need to pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for small businesses. FY2017 fee rates under BsUFA I are shown in Table 4. The FDA provides information on the amount of BsUFA fees collected each fiscal year and how the fees are spent in an annual financial report. The five-year biosimilars user fee authority was scheduled to sunset on October 1, 2017. FDA held a public meeting on the reauthorization of the program\u2014BsUFA II\u2014on December 18, 2015. From March 2016 through May 2016, the agency held negotiation sessions with industry on the reauthorization agreement. In September 2016, the agency posted on its website the draft BsUFA II agreement on FDA performance goals and procedures for FY2018 through FY2022. A second BsUFA II public meeting was held on October 20, 2016. The FDA reauthorized the biosimilar user fee program through the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. Challenges were faced in achieving BsUFA I goals due to lack of staff, but new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act are expected to strengthen staff capacity. The FDA reauthorized the biosimilar user fee program through the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. Challenges were faced in achieving BsUFA I goals due to lack of staff, but new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act are expected to strengthen staff capacity. The enhancements aim to allow FDA to meet performance goals, save time and resources for applicants, encourage price competition, and lower healthcare costs. Under BsUFA II, certain fees have been dropped while others have been retained. Under BsUFA II, the supplement fee and establishment fee have been dropped, while the initial, annual, and reactivation BPD fees have been retained. The product fee is now called the BsUFA Program fee, with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. The application fee will no longer be reduced by the cumulative BPD fees paid. FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 for the BsUFA program costs, with a possible adjustment of up to $9 million. The federal government, including NIH, focuses on basic research while the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, with some questioning the federal role in costly therapeutics development. Studies have tried to quantify the impact of publicly funded research on new drug discovery. The federal government and pharmaceutical industry have different focuses in drug development. Studies have tried to quantify the impact of publicly funded research on new drug discovery, with some questioning the federal role in costly therapeutics development. Research shows a percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from non-industry sources, including new molecular entities and biologics. Innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs) by the FDA, often offer new therapies for patients. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of FDA-approved drugs, including those with priority review, stem from publicly funded research. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research. This suggests that drugs discovered by PSRIs may have a disproportionately important clinical effect. The 2011 Stevens study examined the role of Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) in drug discovery, focusing on drugs with significant clinical impact. The study excluded PSRIs' contributions to platform technologies like recombinant DNA and antibody production methods, which were developed with public funds. The study focused on platform technologies like recombinant DNA and antibody production methods developed by PSRIs, which enabled the development of many FDA-approved products. These technologies were crucial for drug discovery, with 36 biologic drugs being discovered at least in part by PSRIs. The regulation of biologics by the federal government began with the Biologics Control Act of 1902, which set the foundation for the regulation of biological products under the Public Health Service Act and chemical drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes in response to contamination incidents. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 focused on premarket approval and manufacturing processes for biological products to prevent contamination incidents. It preceded the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which lacked premarket control over new drugs and manufacturing establishment regulations. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was later replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating product safety before marketing. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was replaced by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) in 1938. The FFDCA required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating product safety before marketing. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 specified that biological products licensed under the PHSA are also subject to regulation under the FFDCA. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) regulates biological products like antitoxins, vaccines, and blood components for human disease prevention or treatment. The PHSA aligns with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), which requires safety approval for new drugs. The PHSA was amended in 1997 to mandate a single biological license application (BLA) for these products. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) regulates biological products for human disease prevention or treatment. It was amended in 1997 to require a single biological license application (BLA) for these products. The PHSA also allows for immediate license suspension in case of public health danger. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 created a licensure pathway for biosimilar biological products and authorized the FDA to collect associated fees. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 established a pathway for biosimilar biological products and authorized the FDA to collect fees. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially with the Hygienic Laboratory, then transferred to the FDA's Bureau of Biologics in 1972. In 1982, the FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics split into CDER and CBER. CBER moved to the new FDA headquarters in 2014. Determining jurisdiction for biotechnology products has been challenging. FDA published an Intercenter Agreement in 1991 between CBER and CDER. In 2002, the FDA announced plans to reorganize review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. This allowed CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. The FDA reorganized review responsibilities in 2002, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. This shift allowed CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. Biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Examples include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines. Traditional biologics like vaccines, allergenic products, and blood products remain at CBER."
