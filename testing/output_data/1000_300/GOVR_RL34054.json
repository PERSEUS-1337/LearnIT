    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership for a nationwide broadband network by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The FCC proposed setting aside 10 MHz of public safety spectrum to be paired with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum for a shared nationwide broadband network. This decision was based on the benefits of creating a network with national coverage and sharing spectrum with commercial users to provide funding and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The FCC proposed pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with auctionable spectrum to create a shared nationwide broadband network. This collaboration would provide economies of scale, access to additional spectrum during emergencies, and support a broadband network. The public safety license was created from 24 MHz originally assigned through negotiations and is administered by a Public Safety Broadband Licensee chosen by the FCC. The FCC designated 10 MHz of commercial spectrum to be paired with public safety's 10 MHz for a shared network. The commercial license, known as the D Block, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, Qualcomm, Inc., but failed to meet the reserve price of $1.3 billion. The FCC decided not to proceed with the re-auction, initiating a review of its rules regarding licensing and service requirements. The FCC initiated a review of rules for the re-auction of the D Block, seeking comments on new auction rules. The commercial license will be offered as a national license or in smaller licenses covering 58 regions. The FCC is preparing for Auction 73, offering a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Public safety associations are requesting local networks to operate on the public safety spectrum. The goal is to combine public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communications support. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for developing national public safety communications support. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. An economic stimulus program may include funding for critical infrastructure improvements and public safety. In the current economic situation, public sector funding may receive renewed interest. An economic stimulus program could include funding for critical infrastructure improvements, such as public safety networks. The federal government could temporarily act as a commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users is seen as beneficial for public safety, providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The report discusses the benefits of sharing spectrum and network facilities between the public and private sectors for public safety. It highlights the need for sufficient spectrum and a source of funds to support the creation of a national public safety license. A source of funds is needed to cover costs for public safety associated with a national public safety license, including rebanding and spectrum license administration. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership, such as a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a Network Sharing Agreement. Commercial partners will use the shared network for consumer services, requiring incentives to meet higher standards. The D Block license failed to attract a winning bid, leading to a public debate on possible flaws in the auction structure and rules. Commercial partners using the shared network for consumer services require incentives to meet higher standards, ignoring the significant demand from the business sector for mobile data access with security and reliability equal to public safety standards. Some reasons for the D Block license failure have been discussed in the media and congressional hearings. Debate includes modifying auction rules to attract bidders while maintaining the public-private partnership structure. One suggestion is to eliminate FCC requirements that may deter bidders and remove the network sharing requirement. The course of action proposed involves changing auction rules to attract bidders for the D Block license without altering the public-private partnership structure. It suggests removing network sharing requirements and empowering public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships. Federal funds would be used to build a public safety network, with proceeds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies funding the project. Congressional action would be required to authorize expenditures.

Federal funds would be used to build a public safety network, with proceeds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies funding the project. Congressional action would be required to authorize expenditures. Different organizational structures for managing a public safety network that shares resources with commercial and other spectrum-license holders may also require legislation for the organizational structure. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions in its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions in its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, including potential rule changes for the auction of the D Block license to attract bidders and maintain the public-private partnership structure. This could involve modifications to requirements for the winning bidder, changes in the network sharing agreement, or terms applicable to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC is considering various options for the auction of the D Block license, including eliminating financial penalties for failure to negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement, re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances, and reworking the network sharing agreement to accommodate strong bidders. Some proposals suggest offering the D Block as a commercial license under terms similar to other blocks of licenses assigned through Auction 73. Many are suggesting that surplus funds from Auction 73 and other auctions be used to build a public safety network, as proposed in the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer a solution using federal funds for a nationwide, interoperable network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps testified that they prefer a solution using federal funds for a nationwide, interoperable network. Recommendations for using spectrum proceeds to fund the network lack details on fund distribution. A cooperative organization involving multiple public safety partners would build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for regional, state, and local networks to connect during emergencies. A cooperative organization involving multiple public safety partners would build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for regional, state, and local networks to connect during emergencies. This partnership would require a smaller financial commitment from the commercial partner and more participation from state and local agencies. Network builders and operators would collaborate to ensure interoperability, with funds for public safety potentially distributed through existing grant programs. The commercial network, working with numerous public safety collaborators, would likely lead in investment and technology decisions. The public safety partner would likely lead in investment and technology decisions, working with multiple commercial partners. Licenses could be assigned to numerous commercial partners for local markets and rural coverage. The FCC could potentially set standards for network design, with federal funds used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The network sharing agreement would prioritize the competitive position of the commercial partner, with federal funds potentially used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized, and funding support would be increased to ensure the economic viability of the public safety network. A federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization could be established to operate the network, with funding coming from appropriations for that purpose. A federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization could operate the public safety network at 700 MHz, funded through appropriations or other means. Congressional oversight would replace FCC regulatory roles, allowing for the creation of a new broadband network for public safety. The FCC seeks Congress's assistance in creating a new broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block. Congress could provide additional authority for this initiative, allowing for provisions on eligibility, network sharing agreements, auction rules, and service rules. The FCC seeks Congress's assistance in creating a new broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block. This includes eligibility provisions, network sharing agreements, auction rules, and service rules. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would have borrowed $197 million for capital expenditures, such as building an overlay for network administration and customer care for public safety customers. The FCC is seeking opinions on funding sources for capital and operating costs. The FCC is seeking opinions on funding sources for capital and operating costs for a new broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz. Possible funding sources include the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF), with the need for potential amendments by Congress. The Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) is a not-for-profit venture capital company created with the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to provide capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry. Its primary source of capital is the interest accrued on deposits held by the FCC. Congress may need to amend existing statutes authorizing the fund's uses. The FCC has consistently provided auction rules since 1994, allowing it to establish financial requirements for bidders and provide economic incentives. The FCC has consistently provided auction rules since 1994, allowing it to establish financial requirements for bidders and provide economic incentives. Service rules for advanced wireless services typically include requirements for license use within a specific timeframe and can specify technologies, uses, or users. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to mandate spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees. The FCC expanded service rules for Auction 73 to include spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees, creating a regulatory framework for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction. The FCC aimed to anticipate and address potential issues in building and operating a shared network by setting and enforcing rules and requirements. The FCC established a regulatory framework for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction, which includes a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a Commercial partner, and a Network Sharing Agreement. Compliance with FCC guidelines, approval of contracts by the FCC, oversight, and dispute resolution are key components of the framework. The FCC's regulatory framework for the 700 MHz band auction includes compliance with FCC guidelines, contract approval, oversight, and dispute resolution. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety use as part of the transition to digital television. The 700 MHz band was allocated for public safety use during the transition to digital television. Planning began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report by the Public Safety National Coordination Committee. The governance for these channels involves Regional Planning Committees and the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council. The band plan has been revised to create two different licensing approaches with modifications negotiated by the FCC. The band plan for the 700 MHz spectrum has been revised by the FCC with the support of NPSTC. It now includes two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. Narrowband channels have been reassigned for voice operations in specific frequency blocks. RPCs are required to submit amended band plans, and funding for narrowband networks will come from a mix of local, state, and federal sources. The FCC has revised the band plan for the 700 MHz spectrum, requiring RPCs with approved band plans to submit amendments. Funding for narrowband networks will come from local, state, and federal sources. Spectrum will be allocated for broadband communications in specific frequencies, with guard bands to prevent interference. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan. The FCC has revised the band plan for the 700 MHz spectrum, requiring modifications to equipment for public safety network operators. The cost of changes may be covered by the commercial D Block licensee. Requirements include forming a not-for-profit corporation, establishing standards, and compliance. The national network's construction costs would be covered by the commercial partner, with potential public sector funding for enhancements. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit status, absence of commercial interests, and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST) was formed by public safety associations in anticipation of receiving the public safety license. Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor to negotiate with the D Block licensee. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License. Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor to negotiate with the D Block licensee for the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint board members for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, with later changes increasing the board to 13 members and adding at-large representatives. At-large members were selected jointly by FCC bureaus for Public Safety and Wireless Telecommunications. The FCC increased the number of at-large members on the board to four, selected jointly by the FCC bureaus for Public Safety and Wireless Telecommunications. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council was eliminated as a named member due to membership overlap. The selected licensee, PSST, would need to file quarterly financial reports with the FCC and meet specific criteria for incorporation and bylaws. The FCC would provide extensive oversight as needed. The FCC requires the licensee to meet criteria for incorporation and bylaws, with extensive oversight provided as needed. Suggestions for reassignment or re-auction of the D Block license were rejected. The FCC reserves the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary and revoke the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's license if it fails to comply. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary and revoke the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's license if it fails to comply. The public safety license would be valid for ten years, renewable, with additional tasks set by the FCC including negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with its commercial partner. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee would have additional tasks set by the FCC, including negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with its commercial partner. Responsibilities include administering network access for public safety users, representing their interests, negotiating purchase agreements, and approving equipment and applications on the network. Local entities must seek approval before linking their systems to the broadband network. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has the authority to determine equipment and applications on the network, approve system linkages, coordinate station access, oversee user relocations, and decide on federal agency access. They also review wideband network construction requests and facilitate negotiations for network sites on public land. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would be entitled to a bidding credit for small businesses. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz, offered as a single, nationwide license in Auction 73. The FCC set a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block license in Auction 73, which had a presumed value of $1.7 billion. The winning bidder needed to meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The winning bidder for the D Block license in Auction 73 needed to meet specific requirements set by the FCC, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The negotiations for the agreement were to begin after the bidder filed its long form application, with the NSA required to be completed within six months and approved by the FCC. Additionally, a separate agreement was required to grant the Public Safety Broadband Licensee certain rights in case of network asset sales or D Block license cancellation. The winning bidder for the D Block license in Auction 73 needed to meet specific requirements set by the FCC, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Negotiations for the agreement were to begin after the bidder filed its long form application, with the NSA required to be completed within six months and approved by the FCC. Additionally, a separate legal entity was required to hold the D Block license, own the network assets, and serve as an operating company. The FCC would oversee the negotiation process, with detailed monthly reports required after three months. The D Block license winner must form separate legal entities to hold the license, own network assets, and operate the company. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and approved by the FCC. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would be a neutral observer at all negotiation stages. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would be a corporate structure comprised of quasi-independent companies, each with a designated function, all approved by the FCC. These entities would be subject to the Communications Act and the Commission's rules. They would have the responsibility to build out the shared network as specified in the Network Sharing Agreement and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could lead to revocation of all or part of the agreement. The FCC would be responsible for building the shared network as outlined in the Network Sharing Agreement and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could result in revocation of the D Block license, with a penalty of 10% of the auction price. The license would be valid for ten years, with the possibility of renewal if FCC rules are followed. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build out on the 700 MHz band. The commercial corporation formed must comply with FCC rules and build the public safety network. By 2016, 95% of the population nationwide should have coverage, and by 2019, 99.3% should be covered. The FCC set benchmarks for a population-based build-out on the 700 MHz band. By 2019, 99.3% of the population should be covered. The D Block licensee must meet build-out deadlines or risk license cancellation. To improve coverage in rural areas, the licensee must comply with FCC requirements. The D Block licensee must meet FCC benchmarks for population coverage and confirm compliance to avoid license cancellation. To enhance rural coverage, they must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety use. The licensee must ensure signal robustness for population coverage requirements and adhere to Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) for service to public safety users. FCC prohibits discontinuation or degradation of service to public safety customers without approval. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to meet population coverage benchmarks and comply with the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) to provide reliable service to public safety users. The NSA serves as the foundation of the public-private partnership, with the FCC overseeing and approving all components to ensure network standards are met. The FCC sets requirements for the D Block licensee to meet population coverage benchmarks and comply with the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) to provide reliable service to public safety users. The NSA includes minimum standards for the network, such as specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data, communications interoperability, signal coverage, and robustness for public safety standards. The FCC expects the D Block licensee to provide signal coverage meeting public safety standards, with reliability, robustness, capacity, security, encryption, and prioritization of public safety communications. The FCC expects the D Block licensee to provide signal coverage meeting public safety standards, with reliability, robustness, capacity, security, encryption, and prioritization of public safety communications. This includes automatic prioritization of public safety communications in real time, prioritization by type, operational control by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, approval of public safety equipment specifications, and provision of integrated handsets for public safety use on 700 MHz and satellite frequencies. The FCC rules require the D Block licensee to provide signal coverage meeting public safety standards and prioritize public safety communications. The licensee must also approve equipment specifications and provide integrated handsets for public safety use on 700 MHz and satellite frequencies. Additionally, a common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability must be adopted by all public safety users participating in the network. The FCC stipulated guidelines for negotiations to create a Network Sharing Agreement, including fee structures and duration of the agreement. Service fees, including those for normal network service and priority access during emergencies, must be specified in the agreement. The FCC ruled that service fees, including normal network service and priority access during emergencies, must be specified in the Network Sharing Agreement. Licensees are expected to negotiate \"reasonable rates\" in good faith, with guidelines for a pricing structure that includes financial incentives for commercial licensees and affordable rates for public safety. The D Block licensee is expected to negotiate fees based on the number of public safety subscribers and to protect them from unforeseen payment obligations. The FCC expects D Block licensees to negotiate reasonable rates for service fees with public safety partners, ensuring affordable pricing aligned with commercial services but at lower rates. The Network Sharing Agreement may be renewed for up to ten years, with the FCC deciding on renewals or modifications concurrently with the D Block license renewal. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) duration aligns with the D Block license and may be renewed or modified by the FCC. Approval from FCC Commissioners or Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety is required for any major changes. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee for commercial use. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to lease access to frequencies on a secondary basis to public safety users. This privilege is part of the public-private partnership agreements, with the D Block licensee building a network for public safety use. A spectrum manager leasing arrangement is mandated for the full ten-year license term. The FCC mandates a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the D Block licensee to lease spectrum to public safety users. The D Block licensee must ensure public safety users do not experience interference and prioritize first responders on the network. The FCC requires the network to prioritize first responders automatically, with immediate preemption by commercial users. Public safety has real-time emergency access to the D Block spectrum. The definition of an emergency is part of the NSA, and the FCC can declare an emergency if agreement is not reached. The band plan was revised to accommodate narrowband and broadband networks for public safety. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. They also resolved spectrum management issues and made decisions regarding network operations, including requiring technical adjustments by the D Block licensee and capping reimbursement at $10 million. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band, requiring technical adjustments by the D Block licensee and capping reimbursement at $10 million. The new plan includes separate sets of paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband networks, prohibiting new narrowband operations on relocated networks. Some states have already started building narrowband networks in the 700 MHz band. The FCC required frequencies in the 700 MHz band to be vacated for broadband use by February 17, 2009. Motorola estimated the cost of retuning equipment for the proposed rebanding plan at $9.45 million. The FCC approved a rebanding plan proposed by the NPSTC, with a cost estimate of $9.45 million by Motorola. The D Block licensee would cover rebanding costs, with a cap of $10 million in reimbursements. To control costs, only systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, would be covered, limiting the estimated cost to around $6 million. The FCC approved a rebanding plan with a cost estimate of $9.45 million by Motorola. To control costs, only systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, would be covered, limiting the estimated cost to around $6 million. Licensees must reach an agreement on relocation expenses within 30 days. The commercial D Block licensee must reach an agreement with the FCC on relocation and rebanding costs within 30 days. Public safety network operators seeking reimbursement must provide detailed information on their equipment and operations. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations. The D Block licensee must agree on relocation and rebanding costs with the FCC within 30 days. They are responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables. The rule making does acknowledge the possibility of reimbursement for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's costs related to the rebanding program, not exceeding $10 million. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs for changes necessitated by rebanding, to be submitted to the FCC as part of the required relocation plan. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs for changes necessitated by rebanding, not exceeding $10 million. The agreed amount must be submitted to the FCC as part of the relocation plan, certified by all parties involved. The approved amount must be paid into a trust account by the public safety licensee, who will administer payments according to the agreed schedule. No payments can be made until the D Block license is conferred to the winning bidder. The FCC requires public safety network operators to obtain a waiver for operating wideband systems. The waiver request must include an application, a letter from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed conditions of operation, a transition plan to the broadband network, and certification of no reimbursement sought for future transition costs. Grants for waivers will only be given after the D Block license is conferred to the winning bidder. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks. Licenses for wideband operations will be valid for five years and devices must be interoperable with the broadband network. No wideband operations will be permitted in broadband frequencies, except under rare circumstances. The FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks under the Communications Act. It would monitor and regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and companies managing the D Block license obligations. Congressional oversight would be within the jurisdiction of telecommunications committees. The FCC extended its authority to write service rules for auctions to oversee a network with a potential asset value in the tens of billions of dollars controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC has authority over the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and D Block license obligations. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation or license revocation. Congress may provide guidance through legislation. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address issues with the shared network. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address issues with the shared network by providing guidance to the FCC commissioners. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055, Harman) would allocate funds for operating expenses and promote the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety communications network. It also imposes limits on the activities of the public safety license-holder. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 aims to create a trust fund for purchasing interoperable radios for a new public safety network. It is linked to the auction of the D Block spectrum, with proceeds going into the Trust Fund. Additional funds would come from future auctions. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 is connected to the auction of the D Block spectrum, with proceeds going into a Trust Fund. The plan includes placing all net proceeds from the D Block Auction into the Trust, along with funds from future auctions to support the purchase of interoperable radios for a new public safety network."
