    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering proposals to limit government risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate due to increased mortgage defaults and borrowing costs. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced capital inadequacy due to rising mortgage defaults and borrowing costs. To support them during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock and the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS. The enterprises are required to pay a 10% cash dividend on the Treasury funds, and their survival without continued support is uncertain. The enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are required to pay a 10% cash dividend on Treasury funds. Proposed legislation may increase their costs and limit the types of mortgages they can purchase, potentially impacting their competitiveness in the market. Proposed legislation may increase costs and limit mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially impacting their competitiveness. Bills would impose new limitations on mortgage types, increase regulatory oversight, and require increased capital requirements. Other proposals include filing requirements with the SEC and setting a deadline for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved. Legislative proposals aim to impose new rules on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including deadlines for returning to stockholder control or dissolution. The bills also suggest replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. The enterprises faced financial difficulties due to mortgage delinquencies and entered voluntary conservatorship in 2008. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship due to financial difficulties from mortgage delinquencies. The Federal Housing Finance Agency took control of the enterprises, with the Treasury providing financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners rely on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for mortgage funding through the purchase of mortgages from lenders and packaging them into MBS for sale to investors. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into MBS, and sell them to investors. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system. The Obama Administration presented three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system, including proposals for a privatized system with government guarantee during a crisis. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement these proposals. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses various concerns, with some bills focusing on executive compensation and others aiming to reform multiple areas. The 112th Congress introduced legislation addressing concerns in various areas, including executive compensation and reforms. H.R. 31, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require quarterly reports on specific areas of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operations. The 112th Congress introduced legislation requiring quarterly reports on specific areas of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operations, including executive compensation, reducing conforming loan limits, foreclosure mitigation, mortgage fraud prevention, communications with Federal Reserve and Treasury, enterprise investments, equity investments by Treasury, capital levels, underwriting standards, mortgage buyback policies, and actions affecting enterprise securities. The FHFA inspector general would review the reports and inform Congress of findings. The 112th Congress introduced legislation requiring quarterly reports on various aspects of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operations. The director could include additional relevant information, with the FHFA inspector general reviewing and informing Congress of findings. The bill also mandates posting reports and comments on the FHFA website, examining loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. There is some overlap with current reports on financial performance, investments, and loss mitigation efforts. The FHFA's monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report covers loss mitigation efforts. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress requires quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operations, with the FHFA inspector general reviewing and informing Congress of findings. H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, aims to make the enterprises subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, would subject the enterprises to FOIA requests by making them federal agencies. H.R. 1221, Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, aims to limit executive pay at the enterprises and align it with federal government's general schedule. Executive compensation would be tied to the enterprises' profitability. The enterprises would be paid based on the federal government's general schedule, with a maximum pay of $155,500 in Washington, DC in 2011. Executive compensation would be linked to profitability and covered by TARP provisions. The bill clarifies that enterprise employees are not federal employees. The House Financial Services Committee ordered the bill to be reported as amended on November 15, 2011. FHFA, as conservator, currently has the authority to reject enterprise salaries, but this bill would remove that discretion. FHFA can prohibit excessive executive compensation but cannot set specific salary ranges. FHFA, as regulator, has the authority to prohibit and order an enterprise to withhold executive compensation that is \"not reasonable and comparable\" to similar companies. H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, would require enterprises to charge a guarantee fee reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. The House Subcommittee marked up the bill and FHFA, as conservator, could implement these provisions. The House Subcommittee marked up H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, and forwarded it to the full committee. FHFA, as conservator or receiver, has the authority to implement these provisions. H.R. 1223, GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, would prohibit treating mortgage-backed securities issued by the enterprises differently from similar MBS issued by other companies. Regulatory determinations for \"qualified residential mortgages\" should not solely be based on the enterprises' role in securitization, as per Dodd-Frank. The Dodd-Frank Act requires joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS. QRMs would be exempt from this requirement. The House Subcommittee forwarded H.R. 1223 to the full committee for consideration. Scott G. Alvarez testified that the enterprises are not exempt from the risk retention requirement under Dodd-Frank. The Committee on Financial Services forwarded H.R. 1223 to the full committee after Scott G. Alvarez testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt enterprises from the risk retention requirement. H.R. 1224, GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. Fannie Mae's portfolio was $789 billion and Freddie Mac's was $697 billion at the end of 2010. Treasury has financial support agreements with the GSEs. The GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. The current portfolio sizes are $789 billion and $697 billion respectively. The bill would align with companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 on a five-year schedule, or H.R. 408 and S. 178 on a four-year schedule. The goal is to meet the portfolio caps set by the Treasury, decreasing annually to reach $250 billion by 2022. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises discussed H.R. 1224, which would not count repurchased delinquent mortgages against portfolio limits. FHFA could order enterprises to reduce risk more rapidly. H.R. 1225 would require enterprises to seek Treasury approval before issuing new debt. The House Subcommittee discussed H.R. 1225, requiring enterprises to seek Treasury approval before issuing new debt. The Secretary of the Treasury would announce his decision in writing to the enterprise, FHFA, and Congress, with a seven-day waiting period before debt issuance. The Secretary currently has this authority under Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's charters, but the practice has fallen into disuse. Former Assistant Secretary Emil Henry noted a more formal process existed until the mid-1990s. The House Subcommittee discussed H.R. 1225, which would require enterprises to seek Treasury approval before issuing new debt. The Secretary of the Treasury could assert existing review authority contained in the enterprises' charters. H.R. 1226, the GSE Mission Improvement Act, would repeal affordable housing goals and other provisions established by previous acts. FHFA would have six months to submit a plan. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 would be repealed by H.R. 1226, removing the duty to serve underserved markets and funding for housing trust fund and capital magnet fund. FHFA must report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans in rural areas. H.R. 1227 would limit FHFA from approving new products while enterprises are in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1227, the GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would restrict FHFA from approving new products while enterprises are in conservatorship or receivership. The bill was forwarded to the full committee after being marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. Additionally, H.R. 2425, the Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, would prohibit certain entities from certain actions related to mortgage registration. FHFA could announce a new policy to restrict new product approvals while GSEs are in conservatorship. H.R. 2425 prohibits Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae from dealing with mortgages registered with MERS. MERS is facing legal challenges regarding its authority in foreclosures and ownership history of real estate. Some employment contracts between enterprises and employees cover legal expenses. H.R. 2428 aims to reduce GSE legal fees. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, would require enterprises to propose a methodology for determining \"reasonable\" legal expenses for employees. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, aims to prevent a reduction in annual dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, empowers FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter at the termination of a limited-life entity created in receivership. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, would give FHFA the authority to revoke an enterprise's charter and requires it to be revoked at the end of a limited-life entity created in receivership. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, aims to terminate the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Hope Reserve Fund established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In the FY2010 budget, $80 million was appropriated for the Capital Magnet Fund. H.R. 2440 would direct FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such as patents and mortgage data, and submit a plan to sell them. H.R. 2462 would set the maximum amount of support Treasury can provide each enterprise in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. An amendment to this bill would allow additional financial support if the private secondary mortgage market were not viable. The Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPA) provide financial support to enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Initially limited to $100 billion each, the amount was later raised to $200 billion. Amendments allowed for unlimited support in 2010-2012, reverting to the $200 billion limit thereafter. Additional support may be provided if the private secondary mortgage market is not viable. Companion bills in the 112th Congress include H.R. 408, S. 178, H.R. 1182, and S. 693. For more details on the enterprises' financial condition, refer to CRS Report RL34661. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's financial problems are addressed in companion bills introduced in the 112th Congress. The legislation includes provisions from H.R. 1221 through H.R. 1227 and aims to terminate the enterprises' conservatorships within 24 months. Other unrelated issues are not covered in this report. The GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act aims to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24 months. After leaving conservatorship, the enterprises would need to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years and would no longer have housing goals. The GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act aims to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24-30 months. After leaving conservatorship, the enterprises would either be returned to stockholder control or dissolved under receivership. Three years after returning to stockholder control, their charters would be repealed for new business, leading to a 10-year wind-down period before dissolution. FHFA would have strengthened authority to enforce minimum capital levels. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost areas.

These associations would be restricted to purchasing and securitizing existing mortgages, specializing in markets like community banks and multifamily mortgages. Mortgages on single-family dwelling units could be purchased with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. The bill also proposes the creation of a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting certain underwriting standards, with restrictions on affordable housing goals during the transition period. H.R. 2413, the Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages Act of 2011, proposes creating a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific underwriting standards. The facility would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees, adjusting them to maintain a market share below 50%. The guarantee fee aims to cover mortgage payments in normal times, while the reinsurance fee compensates Treasury for the federal guarantee. Eligible mortgages must be 30 years or less and not exceed 80% of the sales price. The proposed Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages Act of 2011 would establish a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific underwriting standards. Mortgages eligible for purchase would be for 30 years or less, not exceed 80% of the sales price, and be overseen by a reorganized FHFA."
