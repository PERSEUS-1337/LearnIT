The Middle East is a major recipient of U.S. economic and security assistance, making it a focus of congressional interest. Data sources include the Greenbook, appropriations data from the Department of State and USAID, and information from executive branch agencies. U.S. foreign aid to the Middle East aims to advance core interests such as supporting Israel, maintaining peaceful relations with Arab neighbors, protecting energy supplies, and combating terrorism. Assistance also backs peace treaties between Israel and Egypt, as well as Jordan, and promotes a \"two-state\" solution between Palestinians and Israel.

Congress did not provide specific OCO funds for countering the Islamic State in FY2015, but increased OCO funds in many accounts for Middle Eastern countries. The United States provides aid to Middle Eastern countries through regional programs like Middle East Regional (MER) and Near East Regional Democracy (NERD) to support issues such as women's rights, public health, and democracy promotion in Iran. The Administration requested $40 million in ESF funding for MER in FY2016. The NERD program, funded through ESF, promotes democracy and human rights in Iran. Programming for Iranian activists occurs outside the country due to the regime's resistance to opposition activities supported by foreign donors. The Administration is requesting $30 million for NERD in FY2016. MERC, a USAID-managed program funded through ESF, supports research cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

Morocco's grants focused on private agricultural and tourism sectors, while Jordan's aimed to increase water supply and improve water efficiency. The MCC signed a compact with Jordan to enhance water supply in Amman and Zarqa, focusing on efficiency in water delivery and wastewater management. Critics argue that countries with poor democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid, suggesting that Jordan's low scores in political rights and civil liberties should disqualify them. Several development analysts argue that Jordan, despite doing well on some indicators, should not be eligible for aid due to its status as a large recipient of U.S. aid, access to private sector capital, and lack of democracy. The debate on funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing for nearly fifteen years, following the reorientation of U.S. policy after the 9/11 attacks. The 9/11 attacks shifted U.S. policy towards promoting democracy in the Middle East. Funding for democracy promotion during the Arab Spring caused tensions in countries like Egypt.

The State Department proposed the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA-IF) in FY2013 and FY2014, but Congress did not authorize or appropriate any funding. In FY2015, the Administration sought increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds. This new approach aimed to support reforms in transitional states with a lower level of ESF funds compared to the previous MENA-IF request. The FY2015 request for the MENA Initiative sought to support reforms in transitional states using ESF funds at a lower level than previously requested for MENA-IF. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying P.L. 113-235 included language supporting \"Middle East Response\" and provided flexibility for funding transfers. Proposals for restructuring U.S. assistance to Egypt have been influenced by the focus on foreign aid since 2011. The intense focus on U.S. foreign aid to Egypt since 2011 has led to proposals for restructuring assistance.

The United States announced a halt to cash flow financing for weapons systems to Egypt starting in FY2018, despite continuing to seek $1.3 billion in aid from Congress. Critics argue that this financing undermines congressional independence, while supporters believe it is necessary for Egypt's fight against terrorism. The United States has decided to halt cash flow financing for weapons systems to Egypt starting in FY2018, despite seeking aid from Congress. This decision follows a review of U.S. foreign assistance policy towards Egypt after the 2013 ouster of former president Mohammed Morsi. The move may reflect a broader policy approach balancing national security interests and democratic principles in dealing with Egypt's military-backed government. The White House aims to balance national security interests and democratic principles in its approach to the post-Morsi Egyptian government.

The Secretary of State must consult with the Committees on Appropriations before restructuring military aid for Egypt. Aid to Palestinians is subject to various conditions and restrictions, including no aid for Hamas, the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PA employees in Gaza. Aid for a future Palestinian state or government that includes Hamas would only be permitted if commitments toward peaceful coexistence with Israel are made. Congressional holds have been placed on international initiatives by Palestinian officials seeking recognition of statehood or pressuring Israel. Potential recipients commit to peaceful coexistence with Israel. Congressional holds delay aid for Palestinian statehood initiatives. Conditions may reduce U.S. aid based on Palestinian actions regarding the ICC.

Some lawmakers have called for the suspension of aid to the Palestinians, but the State Department has stated that relevant restrictions have not been triggered. U.S. support for Tunisia's transition to democracy is seen as vital for regional stability amidst violent upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa.
