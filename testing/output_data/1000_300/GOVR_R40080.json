    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000 between December 2007 and October 2009, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, job numbers fell the following month. Both private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with jobs reaching 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been most affected by job losses, while some service-providing industries like education and health services have continued to add workers. The service-providing sector experienced job losses before the recession began in December 2007. Industries like education and health services have added workers, but job losses in other sectors outweigh their gains. The financial activities industry also started losing jobs before the economic downturn, with real estate being a significant factor. Components of financial activities, such as brokerage firms and banks, have been negatively impacted by the housing market collapse. Despite beliefs that the recession ended in 2009, job losses continued. The housing market downturn negatively affected activities like brokerage firms and banks that purchased high-risk mortgages. Despite beliefs that the recession ended in 2009, sustained job growth after past recessions took months to occur. Job growth did not start until 12-22 months after previous recessions ended, with Congress sometimes creating jobs through increased federal demand for goods and services. Historically, Congress has created jobs through increased federal spending on infrastructure activities like road and bridge building. Other methods, such as public service employment and employment tax credits, have been used less frequently. Green jobs, a part of the emerging green economy, lack a consistent definition at present. The emerging green economy includes green jobs, which are related to industries utilizing renewable resources and producing energy-efficient goods and services. There is no consistent definition of green jobs currently. This discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, with a focus on job creation estimates and models used to calculate the number of jobs nationwide in the construction industry. The section discusses how job creation estimates are developed, focusing on models to calculate jobs nationwide and by state in the construction industry. It also highlights challenges in estimating jobs from green economic activities and the caution needed when using these estimates. Policymakers are interested in comparing stimulus options and understanding the impact of shifting expenditures. The number of jobs created by economic activities is a key consideration for policymakers during economic downturns. Input-output models are often used to estimate job creation, showing how spending affects different industries. Input-output models are utilized for cost-effectiveness to describe interrelationships between industries in the production process. They show how the dollar value of a sale is distributed across industries and how much of the purchased product comes from final and supplier industries. This information is then used to convert output requirements into employment requirements based on productivity estimates for each industry. Total employment requirements for a specific type of final demand can be determined using this method. Employment requirements are derived from productivity estimates for each industry at a particular point in time. It approximates both direct and indirect employment supported by economic activity, expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures. An employment requirements table is similar to an I-O table, showing the number of jobs supported in each industry by one billion dollars spent in a specific industry. An employment requirements table shows the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars spent in a specific industry, including direct and indirect employment. It helps estimate the impact of expenditures on different industries and the job-generating potential of economic activities. The impact of expenditures on industries can vary due to technological advancements and productivity changes over time. Job creation estimates may differ based on changes in price levels and resource availability. Actual job creation may fall short of estimates if the economy is already operating at high capacity. The impact of expenditures on industries can vary due to technological advancements and productivity changes over time. Job creation estimates may differ based on changes in price levels and resource availability. I-O models assume unlimited resources, which may lead to job creation falling short of estimates during high economic activity. Additionally, I-O tables may overstate domestic employment impact if inputs are imported and do not differentiate between full-time and part-time jobs. Estimates of job creation from economic activities should consider direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Induced jobs depend on spending by those employed directly or indirectly. For example, workers from a highway construction project may spend their wages in local businesses. The multiplier effect of federal spending on job creation is complex and uncertain. Estimates vary widely due to factors such as spending habits and economic conditions. The Federal Highway Administration is a key source for employment impact estimates related to road construction projects. The Federal Highway Administration provides varying estimates of the job creation impact of federal spending on road construction projects. The most recent update in 2007 indicates that $1.25 billion expenditure could support 34,779 jobs, with a decrease in job numbers over time. Construction projects funded by $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from the state could create 34,779 jobs. If a state match is not required, then $1 billion in federal funds supports 27,800 jobs. The job numbers have decreased due to rising input costs like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The FHWA estimates that $1 billion in federal funding for construction projects could create 34,779 jobs, with 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. The job estimate is based on a national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs, but specific projects may require different combinations of materials and workers. The FHWA estimates that different projects may require varying materials and workers, affecting the number of jobs supported. Employment figures have been used to justify highway spending in economic stimulus packages, but funds typically spend out slowly. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides free access to employment requirements tables for assessing the impact of policies on employment. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides free access to employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) every five years. The BLS updates the national I-O table from BEA to reflect recent production and distribution technologies, using labor productivity data to develop an employment requirements table. This table reflects 2006 technologies and labor productivity, and was available in late 2008. The BLS employment requirements table for the construction industry includes three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. It provides information based on 2006 technologies and labor productivity. The BLS employment requirements table for construction includes subdivisions for building construction, civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. It shows that 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the construction industry itself. The discrepancy in job figures compared to highway expenditures may be due to various factors like industry definition and data sources. Other types of construction like public school projects are not included in the BLS data. The BLS employment requirements table for construction includes subdivisions for building construction, civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. It shows that 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the construction industry itself. BLS does not break out other types of construction like public school projects. BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries through its RIMS II model. The BEA provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries at the subnational level. The number of jobs supported by $1 billion expenditure in the construction industry varies by state due to different industry mixes and earnings levels. Estimating job creation from green infrastructure activities is more challenging than infrastructure projects. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not separately identify green industries that utilize renewable resources. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category. The electric utility industry is divided into hydroelectric, fossil fuel, nuclear, and other power generation, transmission, and distribution. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category. The conventional I-O model may not accurately estimate the number of jobs supported by green activities due to different input mixes. The construction industry within NAICS lacks a unique category for retrofitting, which requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction. Retrofitting for energy efficiency, such as installing insulation or energy-efficient systems, requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction. This poses a challenge for conventional input-output models in estimating green job creation. One study addressed this by creating synthetic industries to account for sectors like wind, solar, biomass, and building retrofitting that are not recognized in standard input-output tables. The researchers addressed the challenge of estimating green job creation by creating synthetic industries to account for sectors like wind, solar, biomass, and building retrofitting. They combined parts of industries to construct these synthetic industries and assigned relative weights to each industry's contributions. Studies often present employment projections based on different assumptions and time horizons, further complicating the matter. Projections of future job creation in the green economy are based on various assumptions and timeframes, such as a shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. However, the methodologies and assumptions behind these estimates are often unclear, making it challenging to review the results. Additionally, results from studies focused on a specific state may not be applicable to other regions due to differences in industry mixes and available inputs. The job creation estimates in the green economy lack clear methodologies, hindering a thoughtful review of the results. Studies by green economy proponents were not originally intended to quickly stabilize or increase jobs during the recession. Two organizations proposed green economy strategies to stimulate the labor market, including a 2008 report commissioned by the Center for American Progress. The report \"Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy\" commissioned by the Center for American Progress proposes a $100 billion green economic recovery program to create almost 2 million jobs. This includes federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for businesses and homeowners to retrofit commercial buildings. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act proposed by the Apollo Alliance in December 2008 aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a $500 billion program. It includes federal spending of about $50 billion for activities like public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart electrical grid development, as well as tax credits for commercial and residential building retrofits. Some strategies can deliver results within a year, while others may take up to two years to implement. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act is a $500 billion program aiming to create 5 million green-collar jobs. It includes federal spending of about $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. The proposed allocation of funds includes improving the electric transmission grid, repairing roads and bridges, and encouraging the replacement of aging buses and trains with U.S.-made clean-energy vehicles. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $8 billion for repairing roads and bridges, $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles, and emphasized the need for tracking job creation resulting from the legislation. Congress addressed this issue in bill language more than previous Congresses had in countercyclical job creation legislation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires entities receiving ARRA appropriations to report estimates of direct jobs created by infrastructure projects. Recipients submitted their first reports in October 2009, with federal agencies required to post the information online. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance for preparing reports, including job estimates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) review job estimates within 45 days of submission. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) requires recipients of ARRA appropriations to report job estimates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) review these estimates within 45 days. 633,342 jobs were saved or retained through September 30, 2009, based on self-reporting. OMB revised its guidance on job retention in response to feedback, clarifying that a retained job is an existing position sustained by Recovery Act funding. In response to feedback from GAO, OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved so that recipients no longer have to make a subjective judgment. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in Q4 2009 and 682,370 jobs created or saved in Q1 2010. CEA is tasked with submitting quarterly reports on ARRA's effect on employment and economic indicators. The CEA is responsible for submitting quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The first report was issued in September 2009, estimating that ARRA may have added around one million jobs in August 2009. CBO was also tasked with commenting on the number of jobs created or saved as a result of direct government purchases and grants. The CBO estimated that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased employment by 600,000 to 1.6 million jobs through tax cuts and outlay increases by September 2009. This estimate aligns with the CEA's report of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs added by August 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased employment by 600,000 to 1.6 million jobs by September 2009. The CEA estimated that ARRA raised employment by 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs through December 2009, and by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs through March 2010. The CEA's reports on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) showed that by the first quarter of 2010, the law may have increased employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs. The CBO also estimated that ARRA's policies could have added 1.2\u20132.8 million jobs. In the second quarter of 2010, the CEA suggested that ARRA might have raised employment by 2.5 million to 3.6 million jobs. Public investment outlays under ARRA, including clean energy, education, transportation, healthcare, and construction, potentially increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter."
