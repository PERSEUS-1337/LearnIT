    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. The walls of the arteries thicken and constrict, causing the right side of the heart to enlarge and ultimately fail. Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Collaboration among research centers must also be increased. Pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose and is rarely detected in routine medical examinations. Pulmonary hypertension is challenging to diagnose, often mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. New diagnostic standards have improved detection rates. In advanced stages, patients experience severe limitations in physical activity and may become bedridden. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981. Collaboration among top research centers is crucial for advancing understanding and treatment of the disease. In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute created the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry, following 194 patients over several years. Research is focused on understanding the causes and progression of the disease, including genetic and immunologic factors. Research studies on pulmonary hypertension are investigating immunologic and genetic factors, agents causing narrowing of pulmonary blood vessels, and factors leading to cell growth and scar tissue formation in vessel walls. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension include FDA-approved medications and lung transplantation as a last resort due to significant side effects impacting patients' quality of life. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has significantly increased over the past decade, leading to a greater need for medical professional education. Despite the availability of oral therapies, managing pulmonary hypertension remains complex due to significant side effects impacting patients' quality of life. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute hosted a meeting in December 2006 with over 500 attendees, emphasizing the importance of communication among researchers for advancements in pulmonary hypertension management. During a meeting hosted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in December 2006, over 500 individuals attended, marking it as the largest meeting organized by a Federal department for pulmonary hypertension. The consensus reached was that communication among researchers is crucial for future advancements in combating this costly and devastating disease. SEC. 3. PULMONARY HYPERTENSION CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK; EXPANSION OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND TRAINING. Subpart 2 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 424B the following section: \"pulmonary hypertension\" The Director of the Institute will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct clinical trials and collaborate with experts in the field. The network will consist of at least 15 designated clinical centers. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network will include 15 clinical centers, an institute project scientist, a data and coordinating center, a data and safety monitoring board, and a steering committee with principal investigators from each clinical center. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network includes principal investigators, a data and coordinating center, an independent protocol review committee, and a steering committee responsible for determining clinical trials, developing protocols, and analyzing results. Clinical trials may involve combination therapies for pulmonary hypertension. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network is responsible for organizing and supporting clinical trials on combination therapies, new drug avenues, endothelial progenitor cell use, and treatment effects predictive of long-term outcomes. The Institute is responsible for managing and supporting the network, including monitoring trial recruitment, ensuring disclosure of conflicts of interest, and overseeing trial conduct adherence to policies. The Institute manages the network, overseeing trial conduct adherence to policies, appointing specialists for fiscal management, and committee members for protocol review and data safety monitoring. The Director of the Institute appoints the Chair of the steering committee, members of the protocol review committee, and the data safety monitoring board. Additionally, a grant program will be established for a Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program to educate medical professionals. The Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program aims to educate medical professionals, including cardiologists, pulmonologists, rheumatologists, and primary care physicians, to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage pulmonary hypertension. The program will establish at least five regional training sites across the United States at academic health centers. The program aims to establish five regional training sites in the US at recognized health centers, hospitals, or medical practices for pulmonary hypertension education. Each site will have a designated contact and stipend allocation. The entity awarded the grant will set up recruitment mechanisms and program guidelines. The nonprofit entity awarded the grant will establish recruitment mechanisms and program guidelines for enrolling health professionals in the pulmonary hypertension education program. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, prevalence, related diseases, early diagnosis importance, and treatment options. This information will be disseminated through a national non-profit entity with expertise in pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers, including warning signs, early diagnosis importance, diagnostic criteria, and FDA-approved therapies. This aims to keep providers informed about the disease. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers, including cardiologists, pulmonologists, rheumatologists, primary care physicians, pediatricians, and nurse practitioners through a national non-profit entity. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, detailing coverage for FDA-approved therapies. The study will consider outpatient or home health care settings for service delivery. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment."
