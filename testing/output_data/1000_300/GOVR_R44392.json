TAA provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to international trade, and eligible workers can claim the HCTC if they receive specific TAA benefits.

RTAA is a wage supplement for workers aged 50 and older who were certified for TAA and secure qualified employment at a lower wage. It pays 50% of the wage difference for up to two years, with a maximum benefit of $10,000. ATAA is a similar wage-insurance program that existed before the recent TAA reauthorization.

State-qualified health plans, such as state-based continuation coverage and coverage through a state high-risk pool, are also eligible if established by the state. State-qualified health plans, identified by statutory letter designations, include options like state-based continuation coverage, coverage through a state high-risk pool, and coverage under state-operated plans. These plans must provide consumer protections to qualifying individuals, defined as HCTC-eligible individuals. State-qualified health plans must provide four consumer protections to qualifying individuals, including guaranteed issue, coverage for preexisting conditions, equal premiums, and similar benefits. The Health Coverage Tax Credit program ensures that coverage cannot be denied based on preexisting conditions, premiums must be equal for qualifying individuals, and benefits must be similar to others. Certain types of coverage are not considered qualified health insurance under the program. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program, administered by the IRS, involves multiple federal and state agencies. The Department of the Treasury handles advance payments, the IRS reviews tax returns, and the DOL and PBGC help identify eligible individuals. State entities like SWAs also play a role in assisting job seekers with information about benefits like the HCTC. The One-Stop Career Center system provides services to assist job seekers, including information about benefits like the HCTC. State workforce agencies (SWAs) administer unemployment and TAA benefits. SWAs mail HCTC information packets to eligible TAA beneficiaries, including an eligibility certificate. The PBGC also identifies eligible beneficiaries and provides their information to the IRS, who then mails program kits to eligible taxpayers with qualified health insurance. The HCTC is available to eligible taxpayers with qualified health insurance, who can claim the tax credit when filing their tax returns or receive advance payments monthly. The credit is refundable, allowing taxpayers to receive the full amount they are eligible for, regardless of their tax liability.

Payments include 27.5% from the individual and 72.5% from Treasury."
