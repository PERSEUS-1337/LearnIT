    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\". Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. No effective treatment exists to halt or slow the disease progression. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms between ages 30-50, while late-onset occurs after 50 with milder symptoms. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 and progresses rapidly. Symptoms include cognitive decline, behavioral changes like irritability and depression. Juvenile Huntington's Disease progresses rapidly in individuals under 19 years of age, leading to incapacity for employment. Despite medical advancements, Social Security Disability Insurance rules for neurological disabilities have not been updated since 1985. The Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985, including Huntington's Disease. The term \"Huntington's Chorea\" is outdated and inaccurate, failing to recognize the full impact of the disease. Individuals with Huntington's Disease must wait 24 months after qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance before receiving benefits from Medicare. After qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance, individuals with Huntington's Disease face a 24-month waiting period before receiving Medicare benefits, despite often becoming incapacitated before reaching the age-eligibility requirement of 65 years. In contrast, individuals disabled by ALS had the waiting period waived in 2000 due to similarities with Huntington's Disease. The outdated guidelines for Huntington's Disease and the severe incapacitation it causes highlight the urgent need for updated policies. In light of the severe incapacitation faced by individuals with Huntington's Disease, there is an urgent need to revise the outdated Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines and evaluation criteria. Additionally, the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage should be removed, similar to the exemption for individuals with ALS. Revision of medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Commissioner of Social Security will revise medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act in consultation with relevant medical organizations. This includes amending sections 11.00 and 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments to provide criteria for Huntington's Disease and remove references to \"Huntington's Chorea.\" The Social Security Act will amend the Listing of Impairments to include medical criteria for Huntington's Disease and Juvenile Huntington's Disease. This involves revising sections 12.00, 111.00, and 112.00 to provide evaluation criteria for these conditions. The Social Security Act will amend the Listing of Impairments to include medical criteria for Juvenile Huntington's Disease, providing evaluation criteria for these conditions. The term \"Listing of Impairments\" refers to appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Social Security Act will waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This amendment applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for services provided after the enactment of this Act."
