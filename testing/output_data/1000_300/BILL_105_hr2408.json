    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face greater social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 1997. The goals of the Act include enhancing academic success, improving students' skills, promoting safe environments, preparing for workforce participation, and offering alternatives to negative activities. Definitions in the Act clarify terms like \"school\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act authorizes programs to achieve these goals. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to schools for carrying out activities described in section 7(a) of the program. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Additionally, schools may choose to offer drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation activities. These activities should take place after regular school hours during the school year. A school receiving a grant under this Act must provide activities after regular school hours that reflect the specific needs of the population. These activities should be carried out in a designated school building or public facility, and the school is encouraged to involve volunteers, request donations of computer equipment, and collaborate with park and recreation agencies. To avoid duplication of activities, schools receiving grants under this Act are encouraged to involve volunteers, request computer equipment donations, and collaborate with park and recreation agencies. SEC. 8. APPLICATIONS. Each school seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how the goals will be met, collaborative efforts, administration of activities, cooperation with other programs, and funding sources. The application for a grant must detail collaborative efforts, administration of activities, and funding sources, including a plan for obtaining non-Federal funding. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002."
