    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 million for DHS for FY2013. The Senate bill approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million for DHS for FY2013, excluding funds for overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, providing a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 provided a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS for FY2013. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, allowing the federal government to continue operations through March 27, 2013. Increases were proposed for various DHS activities, including Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, and FEMA. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, allowing the federal government to continue operations through March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. It passed the House by a vote of 329-91 on September 13, 2012, and the Senate by a vote of 62-30 on September 22, 2012. On March 26, 2013, the President signed H.R. 933 into law as P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which included $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act included $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts reduced the discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. After the impact of sequestration, $38.348 billion was available for DHS to use. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 112-492, S.Rept. 112-169, FY2013 DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, and FY2013 DHS Budget in Brief. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, with $38.348 billion available after sequestration. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 112-492, S.Rept. 112-169, FY2013 DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, and FY2013 DHS Budget in Brief. Additional information on appropriations bills and resolutions is also included. The Department of Homeland Security's FY2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan is based on historical funding data from FY2006-FY2014. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions and personnel to the new department. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, including funding for various offices and operations. Title I contains appropriations for OSEM, USM, CFO, CIO, A&O, and OIG. Title II contains appropriations for CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and Secret Service. Title III contains appropriations for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. Title IV contains appropriations for USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. Title V contains general provisions for congressional direction. Title IV of the appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. The structure of the bill may vary between House and Senate versions, with additional titles added for special issues. Differences in subcomponents and accounts were noted in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The proposed FY2013 appropriations bills had differences in the structure of subcomponents and accounts, despite the overall parallel structure. The budget authority is determined through a two-stage congressional process, with Congress setting spending totals in the first stage and allocating them to appropriations committees in the second stage. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary funds available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. These funds are then allocated to subcommittees for each appropriations bill as 302(b) allocations, which must not exceed the 302(a) allocation. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year by the Appropriations Committee. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was set for security spending, with all other spending capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments may be made by the Appropriations Committee as appropriations bills progress. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2012 appropriations bills. For FY2013, security spending was capped at $686 billion, with all other spending capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for various purposes, and a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked with developing a federal deficit reduction plan. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2012 appropriations bills. Lower levels agreed to in the House-passed budget resolution were made effective for enforcement in the House. The Budget Control Act triggered an automatic spending reduction process consisting of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The \"joint committee\" sequestration process for FY2013 required the Office of Management and Budget to implement across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. In FY2013, the Office of Management and Budget had to implement spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal reductions from defense and nondefense funding, as required by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made changes to the Budget Control Act procedures for FY2013, including delaying the joint committee sequester implementation and reducing the sequester amount by $24 billion. In FY2013, the joint committee sequester date was delayed by two months to March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the sequester amount. President Obama ordered the sequester implementation as per the Balanced Budget Act, resulting in discretionary spending caps being lowered for FY2013 and FY2014. Sequestration was applied at the program, project, and activity level within each account, with reductions calculated on an annualized basis throughout the fiscal year. The sequestration implemented in FY2013 resulted in reductions calculated on an annualized basis and apportioned throughout the fiscal year. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan, which only includes resources provided through P.L. 113-6. Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to eliminate any excess budget authority beyond FY2013 discretionary spending limits. Section 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to eliminate excess budget authority beyond FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and receives a 0.1% across-the-board cut to align with spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget has the final say on whether limits have been exceeded. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes two separate across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to avoid exceeding spending limits. OMB determined additional rescissions were needed post-enactment, with cuts of 0.032% for security budget authority (applicable to DHS) and 0.2% for nonsecurity budget authority. These cuts aimed to reduce discretionary budget authority in the bill. The across-the-board cuts in the bill aimed to reduce discretionary budget authority, excluding funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013 are shown in Table 2, with adjustments made based on emergency spending and overseas contingency operations. No adjustments were made for emergencies in FY2012 for DHS. The caps on discretionary budget authority have influenced DHS's appropriations process. Emergency spending and overseas contingency operations are not limited, while disaster relief is restricted. For FY2013, OMB determined a $11,779 million allowable adjustment for disaster relief, fully utilized. For FY2013, OMB determined a $11,779 million allowable adjustment for disaster relief, fully utilized. The final DHS appropriations legislation included in Division D of P.L. 113-6 prior to sequestration impact. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for all civilian federal employees in its budget request. The final DHS appropriations legislation included in Division D of P.L. 113-6 prior to sequestration impact. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for all civilian federal employees, but the House rejected it, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither P.L. 112-175 nor P.L. 113-6 provides resources for it. Breaking down the DHS bill by title does not offer transparency into where appropriated resources are allocated. The DHS appropriations bill does not provide transparency into resource allocation. Table 4 and Figure 1 show DHS's budget breakdown for FY 2013. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations, but not general provisions like rescissions. Figure 1 in Table 4 does not include the impact of the bill's general provisions, such as rescissions of prior-year budget authority. The discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6 is scored against the bill's budget allocation, with additional resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap. However, this does not provide a complete picture of the resources available to individual DHS components. The DHS budget includes adjustments to discretionary cap but does not show the full picture of resources for individual components. Some components rely on fee income, not direct appropriations. Less than 4% of CIS budget is from direct appropriations. Figure 2 compares FY2013 budget request and enacted budget, showing discretionary and mandatory appropriations, and Budget Control Act adjustments. The FY2013 budget request and enacted budget for DHS show discretionary and mandatory appropriations, Budget Control Act adjustments, and funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars without adjustments for inflation or sequestration. The report presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars without adjustments for inflation or sequestration. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up bills in 2012, with P.L. 113-6 representing the final outcome. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 was marked up early in the Senate, but the final enactment was delayed. The bill included funding for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The House-passed bill proposed a decrease in funding, while the Senate-reported bill differed in its approach. The Administration requested $1,279 million for DHS accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill proposing $1,020 million and the Senate-reported bill suggesting $1,102 million. After across-the-board cuts, the enacted appropriations for Title I were $1,086 million, reduced to $1,026 million due to sequestration. The enacted appropriations for Title I in FY2013 were $1,086 million, reduced to $1,026 million due to sequestration. The departmental management accounts cover the general administrative expenses of DHS, including various offices under the Under Secretary for Management. The Under Secretary for Management (USM) oversees offices such as OCAO, OCHCO, OCPO, OCSO, OCFO, and OCIO. Funding for headquarters consolidation is usually requested. A graphic provides a visual representation of discretionary appropriations for each DHS component. The FY2013 request compared to FY2012 enacted appropriations is detailed. The FY2013 request for departmental management activities in DHS compared to the previous year's enacted level and included increases for OSEM, OCFO, and OCIO. The total request was $724 million, excluding funds for headquarters consolidation. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM and proposed separate line items for specific offices. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items for three offices. Program changes included funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. The Administration also requested $222 million for the USM and proposed several program changes under this appropriation. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM, including funding for policy advice, investigations, and training related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. Program changes were proposed, such as transferring the Directives function to the OUSM and realigning the Safety function to the OCHCO. Additionally, $55 million was requested for the OCFO, with $6.7 million allocated for Financial Systems Modernization. The Administration requested $55 million for the OCFO, with $6.7 million for Financial Systems Modernization. The OCFO justification stated that the money will be used to implement a new core financial system at FEMA in FY2013 to accurately account for resources. Within the OCIO account, Infrastructure and Security Activities requested $122 million, including $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The Administration requested $122 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. H.R. 5855 proposed appropriations lower than the President's request for various departments within the DHS. The House Appropriations committee recommended a total funding of $627 million for management activities, representing a decrease of $97 million from the President's request. The House Appropriations committee recommended a total funding of $627 million for management activities under Title I, which was $97 million less than the President's request. This decrease was justified by the committee due to the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Amendments were passed to further reduce the budget for management by almost $33 million. The House Appropriations committee recommended $627 million for management activities, $97 million less than the President's request. Amendments passed to reduce the budget by almost $33 million, with the four largest cuts including funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increases for various agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Amendments were made to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $10 million and increase funds for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology by $10 million, as well as to reduce funds by $5 million for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. These changes would have resulted in a $41 million (18.6%) decrease in the USM's appropriation compared to the requested level. Additionally, within the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, funding for official reception and representation expenses was recommended, with a portion allocated for international programs and activities related to the visa waiver program. The Office of the Under Secretary for Management faced amendments to reduce funds and increase funds for other programs. Representative Flake proposed reallocating reception and representation expenses for international programs to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries. Significant provisions withheld $71 million until all required reports were submitted. A provision proposed restricting the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by certain officials. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding funds and proposing restrictions on the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft by certain officials until required reports are submitted. Additionally, funding for the Office of General Counsel and the Office of the Under Secretary for Management faced reductions for non-compliance with statutory requirements. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million reduction (10%) from the requested level for OCPO due to failure to comply with statutory reporting requirements. Over $29 million would have been withheld from obligation under the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted. The Committee also expressed concerns about the role of appropriations liaisons in OCFO. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million reduction for OCPO due to non-compliance with reporting requirements. They expressed concerns about the role of appropriations liaisons in OCFO, expecting direct communication from relevant components. The House-recommended appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer included allocations for salaries, expenses, development, acquisition of IT equipment, software, services, and security activities. The House report recommended reductions in funding for various departments, including OCPO, due to non-compliance with reporting requirements. They also allocated funds for the Office of the Chief Information Officer for salaries, expenses, IT equipment, software, services, and security activities. The Senate-reported bill proposed appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with a total funding of $655 million, representing a decrease from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill proposed a total funding of $655 million for departmental management, which would have been a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. The bill included a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL) to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes. Despite this increase, the recommended budget for OCRCL was down by roughly $1 million (3.5%) from FY2012 levels. The Senate committee recommended a budget decrease for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL) by roughly $1 million (3.5%) from FY2012 levels. Funding for reception and representation expenses was also reduced by 15% for FY2012 and proposed to be further reduced by 10% for FY2013. The committee emphasized the need for robust oversight of major acquisitions, recruitment of skilled workforce, and security measures to safeguard DHS personnel and facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for various offices within the Department of Homeland Security, citing a constrained budget environment. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) would receive $35 million, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in the Salaries and Expenses account. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) would receive $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $248 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments through FY2015. This includes $57 million for development and acquisition of information technology equipment, software, services, and related activities, and $65 million for data center migration. The committee report highlighted that data center consolidation investment is expected to result in nearly $3 billion in savings by 2030. The appropriations for OCIO were slightly lower than the President's request. Center consolidation is expected to save nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with total funding of $643 million, a decrease of $170 million from the President's request. Only OCIO faced a funding reduction due to sequestration. Sequestration under P.L. 112-175 allows for a crediting mechanism to reduce funding cuts for activities below baseline. P.L. 113-6 directs DHS CIO to submit a multi-year IT investment plan for FY2013-2016. The Senate also requires a report on travel costs for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary. See Table 7 for funding details. The Senate directs the Secretary to report travel costs for official and nonofficial trips from FY2008 to present. The Secretary must submit a contingency plan for user fee collections and the USM to provide a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with quarterly updates. The Senate directs the Secretary to report travel costs for official and nonofficial trips from FY2008 to present. The Secretary must submit a contingency plan for user fee collections and the USM to provide a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with quarterly updates, including detailed workforce strategy implementation and financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts are outlined in Table 7, reflecting spending cuts but not sequestration impacts. The management accounts funding numbers for P.L. 113-6 show spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts, without considering the impact of sequestration. The \"DHS Plan\" column indicates budget resources after sequestration as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration effects. Issues identified by House and Senate Appropriations committees include new revenue assumptions, late submissions of required plans, and conference spending by the department. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices - OIA, SLLE, and PSO, currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have these offices report directly to OSEM was rejected during the legislative process. The House committee cited lack of Senate-confirmed heads for the offices and stated the proposal was inconsistent with streamlining the department and reducing administrative overhead. The House committee rejected the proposal to have offices like OIA, SLLE, and PSO report directly to OSEM, citing lack of Senate-confirmed heads and inconsistency with streamlining the department. They directed the Department to consider establishing an external affairs office to consolidate functions of various existing offices. The Senate committee questioned the need for these offices to be standalone entities. The Senate committee questioned the need for standalone entities like OIA, SLLE, and PSO to report directly to OSEM within DHS. The Administration's budget proposed increasing resources through aviation security fee hikes, customs fee revenue use, and CBP reimbursement agreements. The House rejected these proposals, while the Senate approved them. The President's budget assumes new revenue will be generated in the next fiscal year. The House committee report criticized the President's budget for relying on unrealized revenue and highlighted a $115 million shortfall in the DHS budget due to new aviation security fee assumptions. The Committee rejected this budgeting approach and warned of additional reductions in Department requests if such proposals are enacted into law. The Committee rejects budgetary legerdemain and warns of additional reductions in Department requests if such proposals become law. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to initiate pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding from departmental management accounts. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding from departmental management accounts due to the Department's failure to comply with statutory requirements. The Committee emphasized the importance of investment plans, expenditure plans, and reports for DHS oversight and fiscal responsibility. The Committee expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress by DHS, leading to proposed withholding of 59% of budgets from OSEM, USM, and CFO. Compliance with statutory requirements for timely submission of plans and reports is essential for oversight and fiscal responsibility. The Committee expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress by DHS, leading to proposed withholding of 59% of budgets from OSEM, USM, and CFO. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all reports and plans due by May 1 are submitted. The House committee report requires the Department's Office of Inspector General to assess compliance with federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. New provisions on conference spending were included in the House and Senate bills, requiring quarterly reports to the DHS OIG on event costs. The House and Senate bills included new provisions on conference spending, requiring quarterly reports to the DHS OIG on events costing over $20,000. The Senate provision also restricted the use of grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and mandated compliance with OMB Memorandum M-12-12 for travel and conference activities. Section 3003 of Division G of P.L. 113-6 mandated government-wide reporting on conference costs to departmental inspectors general. The House and Senate bills included provisions on conference spending, requiring reports to DHS OIG for events over $20,000. They also limited overseas conference attendance to 50 DHS employees, with exceptions for law enforcement purposes. Section 569 of P.L. 113-6 mirrors the Senate's language on this issue. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the DC area, a legacy of its rapid assembly from 22 federal agencies. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and increased costs, hindering cohesion among its components. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters is a major contributor to inefficiencies due to fragmentation across 45 locations in the DC area. To address this, a $3.4 billion master plan was approved to create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, with $1.4 billion funded through DHS and $2 billion through GSA. Phase 1A of the project, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is nearing operational status with funding provided by Congress. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia has received $1,366 million in funding through FY2012, with $434 million from DHS and $933 million from GSA. Phase 1A, the new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is close to completion with Congress funding. The Administration has requested $89 million for activities related to the project, including a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. The Administration requested funding for a highway interchange to support the DHS consolidated headquarters project, which is not typically funded through Homeland Security appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the interchange or any part of the St. Elizabeths project. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or any part of the St. Elizabeths project through the management accounts in the budget submission to Congress. The bill would have provided the Administration's requested funding for the Coast Guard to move to the new facility, with an additional $10 million through the Coast Guard's construction budget for support. The Committee also recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion in H.R. 5855, which is $89,000,000 below the request. The Committee recommends no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion in the bill, which is $89,000,000 below the request. Funding is included in the Coast Guard appropriation to cover costs related to moving the Coast Guard headquarters to St. Elizabeths. The Department is exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. The Committee encourages the Department to creatively modify or consolidate current leases in anticipation of delays in the permanent headquarters construction. $10,000,000 is allocated for Phase 1 of construction to ensure the Coast Guard can move in 2013 without obstacles to access and transportation. The bill fails to provide $89 million for site access to the new DHS headquarters, causing delays and cost increases. The Coast Guard may be the only tenant for the next 3-5 years as Phase 2 funding is not included. No amendments were considered for DHS headquarters consolidation. The bill does not include funding for Phase 2 of the DHS headquarters relocation in 2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for a highway interchange, funded through the Under Secretary for Management's office. Full funding was recommended for the Coast Guard's move under Coast Guard operating expenses. An attempt to use the $89 million as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed, and the funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The $89 million allocated for a highway interchange was not used as an offset for an unrelated amendment in the full committee markup of the bill. The funding remained in the reported version of the legislation, with requirements for the Under Secretary for Management to submit an expenditure plan detailing how the funds will be allocated for headquarters consolidation. Quarterly briefings on consolidation activities are also mandated. The Department is developing an updated plan with the General Services Administration for headquarters consolidation in smaller segments. The plan is expected to be completed by the end of summer 2012 and will be submitted to the Committee. No funding was provided for headquarters consolidation in Title I of the legislation, but $29 million is allocated in a general provision. The Department is developing a plan for headquarters consolidation in smaller segments, with $29 million allocated for necessary expenses. The funds support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS). The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) manages the DHS intelligence enterprise, collects, analyzes, and shares intelligence information with homeland security partners. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) develops and coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans, managing the National Operations Center. The FY2013 budget request for the Analysis and Operations account was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from the previous year. The FY2013 budget request for the Analysis and Operations account was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from the previous year. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The recommendation was $21 million less than the FY2012 level. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying certain increases and restoring funding for Cybersecurity Analysis. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, which would have been a decrease of $14 million (4.1%) from the previous year's amount. The Committee required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease of $14 million (4.1%) from the previous year. DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer was required to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The plan should focus on I&A's unique expertise and continue semi-annual briefings on the State and Local Fusion Centers program. P.L. 113-6 provides $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, aligning with the President's FY2013 request and 4.7% below FY2012. The House rejected increases for executive service salaries and the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Element. The Analysis and Operations account received $324 million in funding, aligning with the President's FY2013 request and 4.7% below FY2012. The operating plan for DHS for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced this to $306 million. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and overlapping authorities. In 2012, Representative Sue Myrick criticized I&A for lacking focus in its mission due to vague or overlapping authorities. She made these comments during a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Subcommittee hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The Aspen Institute report recommended that DHS's intelligence activities should focus on specific homeward-focused areas to avoid duplication of efforts by other agencies. The Aspen Institute recommended that DHS's intelligence activities should focus on specific homeward-focused areas to avoid duplication of efforts by other agencies, particularly state/local partners. The language in S.Rept. 112-169 highlighted concerns regarding potential duplication of intelligence efforts by other federal agencies. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits mandated by the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. The OIG serves as an independent body conducting audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. The DHS OIG requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits mandated by the 9/11 Commission Act. The House-passed bill included $109 million for the OIG, but $10 million was cut due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. The Committee reduced the DHS OIG appropriation by $10 million due to communication issues regarding border corruption investigations. $24 million of the OIG's budget was funded through a transfer from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the OIG, with an additional $24 million from the DRF for a net $3 million increase above the President's request. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million for the DHS OIG, with an additional $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE. This provided a net $3 million increase above the President's request. The Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $121 million in net budget authority for the OIG for FY2013, with a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund. Sequestration reduced OIG budget authority by $7 million. Both House and Senate bills required the OIG to conduct reviews and provide reports to the Appropriations Committees. The OIG was required by both House and Senate bills to conduct reviews and provide reports to the Appropriations Committees on various matters, including expenditure plans, integrity of CBP and ICE officers, DHS expenditures on special events, non-competitive contract awards, and operations of local law enforcement under 287(g) agreements. The House also directed the OIG to report on DHS compliance with federal laws and regulations, conduct TSA screening inspections, assess fraud detection reforms by USCIS, and review delays in FEMA determinations. The OIG was directed to conduct various reviews and reports by both House and Senate bills, including TSA screening inspections, fraud detection reforms by USCIS, and delays in FEMA determinations. The Senate did not include specific provisions but directed a review of FEMA's application of its rules for awarding public assistance funds. This direction was reiterated in Section 565 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. The explanatory statement emphasized compliance with House and Senate reports language unless specifically negated. The OIG was directed to conduct various reviews and reports by both House and Senate bills, including TSA screening inspections, fraud detection reforms by USCIS, and delays in FEMA determinations. The Senate did not include specific provisions but directed a review of FEMA's application of its rules for awarding public assistance funds. The explanatory statement emphasized compliance with House and Senate reports language unless specifically negated. P.L. 113-6 notes that no additional funding is dedicated for new tasks, except for integrity investigations of ICE and CBP officers. The Senate expressed concerns about the OIG's organizational structure hindering its independence and timely reporting, directing GAO to review its reporting functions. The OIG's organizational structure may hinder its independence and timely reporting, as noted in a report directing GAO to review its reporting functions. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS, with a requested decrease in funding for FY2013. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 requested funding for agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The House-passed bill proposed an increase in funding, while the Senate-reported bill suggested a slight increase as well. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations amount was $31,267 million, with sequestration reducing it to $30,184 million. The operating plan for DHS for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced funding to $30,184 million, affecting various components including CBP responsible for security at ports of entry. CBP officers at ports of entry prevent illegal entries by inspecting people and goods to determine authorization. They enforce over 400 laws and regulations, including Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Interdiction, and Automation Modernization. Additionally, they manage Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Modernization includes customs and immigration IT systems, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Funding numbers for P.L. 113-6 reflect spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts, but do not include additional cuts from sequestration. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows the department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. The \"DHS Plan\" column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. The Administration requested $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million (1.9%) from FY2012. The total request included $1,626 million in fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds, for a gross budget request of $11,971 million, a $320 million (2.8%) increase from FY2012. Program changes included transferring the US-VISIT program from NPPD to CBP with a $261.5 million increase. The FY2012 budget for CBP was $11,651 million. The request for FY2013 included program changes such as transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP with a $261.5 million increase, increasing funding for the Automated Targeting System, Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, National Targeting Center, Container Security Initiative, intellectual property rights enforcement, and CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. The FY2013 budget for CBP included increases in funding for various programs such as the Container Security Initiative and intellectual property rights enforcement, as well as expansions for CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. There were also decreases in funding for the Office of Air and Marine Interdictions and management and administration staffing. Decreases in various expenses within the Office of the Commissioner, Information Technology, Administration, and Public Affairs, including fleet acquisition, information technology infrastructure, nonintrusive inspection operations, CBP officer overtime, field support staff salaries, Air and Marine salaries, and training expenses. The House approved $10,172 in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with decreases in field support staff salaries, Air and Marine salaries, training expenses, and transportation program costs. This represented an increase of $17 million from the previous year's appropriation and a decrease of $173 million from the President's request. CBP would have received $11,689 in gross budget authority, a $37 million increase from last year and a $283 million decrease from the President's request. Amendments included adding funds for staffing model completion and cutting environmental mitigation funds. The Senate proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million from last year and $109 million from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million (3.0%) from last year's appropriation and $109 million (1.1%) from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill included $11,971 in gross budget authority, a $319 million (2.7%) increase over last year's appropriation and a $0.6 million decrease from the President's request. After the across-the-board cuts but prior to applying sequestration, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $201 million (0.02%) from last year's appropriation and $12 million (0.001%) from the President's request. P.L. 113-6 includes $11,872 million in gross budget authority, a $98 million (.01%) decrease below last year's appropriation and a $222 million increase (0.02%) over the President's request. During the FY2013 appropriations cycle, CBP faced budget cuts, including a reduction of $575 million due to sequestration. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for CBP to be $11,298 million, $353 million less than the previous year. Policy issues such as US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, and border surveillance technology were also discussed. Congress mandated changes following the dissolution of the INS. The US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, reimbursement authority, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security are key issues discussed by Congress. The entry-exit system tracks the arrival and departure of foreign visitors using biographic and biometric data stored in DHS databases. The US entry-exit system collects biographic and biometric data on non-citizens entering the country, stored in DHS databases. This information is shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. Non-citizens entering through air and seaports are required to provide biometric data. The system has been operational since 2006 but does not collect biometric data from non-citizens exiting the US. Non-citizens entering the United States provide biometric data at land ports, but not when exiting. Biographic data is collected from passengers exiting through air and sea ports, but not from most exiting through land ports. The President's FY2013 budget did not fund a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. This program identifies overstays and flags high-priority individuals for follow-up. The U.S. entry-exit system collects biometric and biographic data from non-citizens entering and exiting the country. Overstays are identified and high-priority individuals are flagged for follow-up investigations. The system includes a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit program, where Canadian biometric records are treated as U.S. exit records. Some Members of Congress have called for a comprehensive biometric exit system to be implemented. The organizational structure of the entry-exit system within DHS has changed multiple times. The biometric exit system has faced organizational changes within DHS, including being part of the US-VISIT Program and proposed to be under the Screening Coordination Office. However, funding for the SCO was never allocated, leading US-VISIT to become a standalone office within DHS appropriations. US-VISIT was initially planned to be part of a Screening Coordination Office within DHS but ended up as a standalone office due to lack of funding. In FY2008, it was moved to the National Protection and Programs Directorate. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies, but the move was not fully supported by Congress. The House-passed bill proposed transferring $73 million to CBP and ICE offices for entry-exit policy and overstay analysis, leaving $191 million for US-VISIT funding in a new Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The Senate-reported bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation, replacing it with the Office of Biometric Identity Management. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, which was supported by both chambers' budget proposals. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the requested staffing levels but raised questions about how DHS sets such levels. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if DHS preserves high staffing levels during budget tightening, while the House report encouraged CBP to consider changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs. The House and Senate reports suggested reengineering POE processes, improving risk-based targeting, managing staffing demand surges, exploring public-private partnerships, expanding trusted trade programs, and using technology to increase officer efficiency at POEs. Additionally, there were requests for specific staffing plans for border patrol agents and OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry. Some Members may disagree with efforts to reduce CBP staffing. CBP is directed to refine its revenue forecasting model for user fees to ensure adequate budgeting for salaries. Border patrol staffing has increased significantly, but OFO staffing at POEs has only increased slightly despite expanded responsibilities. Some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has led to illegal migrants and drug smugglers entering through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing believe officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions more effectively than automated systems. With the implementation of sequestration on March 1, 2013, DHS officials warned that the automatic spending cuts could result in furloughs of up to 14 days for frontline CBP personnel; reduce overtime hours; and decrease hiring to backfill positions, with the lost work hours adding up to the equivalent of cuts to over 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 2,750 CBP officers. DHS reportedly intends to minimize the impact of the sequester on frontline operations, including by eliminating employee performance awards and incentive payments, reducing outside contracts, limiting administrative expenditures, and working with congressional appropriators to reprogram and transfer certain funds. To minimize the impact of the sequester on frontline operations, CBP plans to eliminate employee performance awards, reduce outside contracts, limit administrative expenditures, and rely on reductions to overtime and hiring freezes. With a significant portion of the budget allocated to salaries and benefits, CBP frontline staffing may face reduced overtime hours and furlough days. The administration aims to leverage current resources for enhanced services at ports of entry through public-private partnerships. The administration plans to reduce overtime hours and furlough days for CBP frontline staffing to minimize the impact of the sequester. They aim to use public-private partnerships to fund enhanced services at ports of entry, despite restrictions on fee-for-service immigration and customs services. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013 for additional services at POEs, new facilities, and land ports of entry. In FY2013, CBP planned to use public-private partnerships to fund additional services at ports of entry, new facilities, and land ports of entry. These partnerships allow for reimbursement of costs, including officer overtime, and expansion of CBP services. User fees, known as COBRA fees, are collected to cover customs services, with a portion directly reimbursing CBP for various functions. CBP receives mandatory funding for customs functions like overtime compensation, benefits, and premium pay for officers. COBRA fees cover additional customs revenue functions but are only available through appropriations acts. Some passenger fees have been collected without appropriation. Congressional interest has been drawn to recent examples of this. Recent examples of passenger fee increases, such as those outlined in the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011, have resulted in significant revenue collection for customs functions. These fee increases eliminated exemptions for travelers from certain countries, directing funds towards COBRA fees. The NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 led to increased COBRA fees from travelers, resulting in a rise in revenue collection for customs functions. Questions have been raised about the disposition of these fees, with the House Appropriations Committee requesting CBP to report on access to funds identified by GAO and how to eliminate them from the department's books. CBP is required to report to the committee on accessing $639 million identified by GAO and eliminating it from the department's books. The House and Senate proposed different solutions to address a shortfall in CBP officer salaries, with the final resolution appropriating an additional $110 million to cover the budget gap. The report addresses a budget shortfall in CBP salaries, with an additional $110 million appropriated to cover the gap. DHS's strategy for border control includes using technology for monitoring and detecting illegal entries, but previous surveillance initiatives have not met expectations. The report discusses previous surveillance initiatives along the border, such as America's Shield Initiative and SBI net, which faced criticism for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, emphasizing the rapid deployment of existing technology for surveillance. House and Senate appropriations reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new plan. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for not procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment for the Arizona Border Technology Plan. Both chambers recommended fully funding the BSFIT account but also called for rescinding unobligated balances, with the House report suggesting $40,412,000 in rescissions and the Senate suggesting $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 includes $73,232,000 for border surveillance. The House and Senate recommended rescinding unobligated balances from the BSFIT account, with amounts of $40,412,000 and $92,000,000 respectively. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP uses manned and unmanned aircraft for border surveillance, with the President's FY2013 budget supporting 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and surveillance. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. The CBP uses manned and unmanned aircraft for border surveillance. In FY2012, OAM reported 81,045 flight hours and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems, with UAS accounting for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support the use of aircraft for border surveillance, while others have concerns about privacy and cost effectiveness. The DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's unmanned aircraft systems program for lacking adequate support resources and potentially under-utilizing UAS assets. Both appropriations committees recommended budget increases for OAM, with the House proposing $82.7 million and the Senate proposing $70.9 million for upgrading the fleet and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 allocated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. The DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's unmanned aircraft systems program for lacking support resources. P.L. 113-6 allocated $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, with a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. The 9/11 Act established a deadline for DHS to begin excluding cargo that has not been scanned before being loaded on ships bound for the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% scanning deadline, raising questions about balancing security benefits with costs such as paperwork, technology maintenance, and longer wait times for importers. Arguments have been made to focus scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo. The DHS is considering focusing cargo scanning on high-risk items and a random sample of lower-risk items to reduce costs and streamline trade. The FY2013 budget includes a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative and $78 million in proposed increases to screening programs for incoming goods and travelers. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees support these funding increases. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations such as alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring. They also locate and remove aliens who have overstayed visas or entered illegally. ICE enforces immigration laws, investigates violations such as alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring, locates and removes overstayed visa aliens, and develops intelligence to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. Funding details can be found in Table 8 and Table 10. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) includes spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts but does not account for additional cuts from sequestration. The Administration requested $5,332 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. This budget request includes increases for the Alternatives to Detention program and personnel consolidation. The budget request for ICE in FY2013 included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel consolidation, video conferencing expansion, and transfer of the US-VISIT Program. Reductions were made for the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $5,474 million in net budget authority for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a budget of $5,474 million for ICE in FY2013, with reductions in funding for the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a slightly lower budget of $5,330 million for ICE. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a budget of $5,330 million for ICE in FY2013, representing a slight decrease from the Administration's request and the FY2012 enacted amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease from the previous year's appropriation but an increase from the President's request. The Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) allocates $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year's appropriation but an increase from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by approximately $200 million. ICE faces challenges in allocating resources effectively to fulfill its mission due to the wide range of civil and criminal violations under its jurisdiction. ICE's budget for FY2013 was reduced, leading to challenges in resource allocation. The agency is responsible for various civil and criminal violations, including detaining and removing unauthorized aliens. With an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the US, ICE aims to remove 400,000 aliens annually. ICE aims to detain unauthorized aliens, with an estimated 10.8 million in the US. There are also 1.9 million criminal aliens. ICE plans to remove 400,000 aliens annually. Legislation directs the agency to prioritize removal of criminal aliens based on severity of the crime. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency aims to detain unauthorized aliens in the US, including criminal aliens. The agency plans to remove 400,000 aliens annually, prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens based on the severity of their crimes. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages custody and removal proceedings for aliens ordered to leave the country. Concerns have been raised about ERO's detention space limitations and the potential impact on decisions to release aliens based on detention space availability rather than individual case merits. Policymakers have suggested increasing the use of alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal aliens. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees due to concerns about inequities in detention conditions and the number of detention beds maintained by ICE. ICE released 2,228 detainees in 2013, citing budget constraints and sequestration as reasons for the release. ICE Director John Morton mentioned that the release was necessary despite funding for 34,000 beds under a continuing resolution. ICE released 2,228 detainees in 2013 due to budget constraints and sequestration. ICE Director John Morton stated that the release was necessary as ICE's average daily detention population exceeded funded beds. Critics viewed the release as a political move to pressure Congress. There is interest in developing alternatives to detention for certain aliens who do not require secure settings. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring for non-detained aliens with final removal orders. It includes electronic monitoring devices, home visits, work visits, and telephone reporting. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million for the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million for the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD program funding by $19 million. ICE's Secure Communities program received $139 million for information sharing between DHS and the Department of Justice. ICE is expanding Secure Communities to check arrestees' fingerprints against immigration records. They aim to confirm the identification of more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. Both House and Senate appropriators support the program's expansion. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local agents has sparked debate about their role. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents through agreements like \u00a7287(g) and Secure Communities has sparked debate about their role. Concerns include proper training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the previous year. Some argue that state and local entities should assist due to scarce federal resources. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the previous year. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. Senate-reported S. 3216 and H.R. 5855 had different funding levels for the 287(g) program. P.L. 113-6 funds the 287(g) program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. The House adopted an amendment to H.R. 5855 prohibiting funds from terminating existing 287(g) agreements. ICE's Public Advocate Office was created in 2012 to address concerns about agency operations, but funding for this position is now prohibited. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems. The Public Advocate position within ICE is prohibited from receiving funds under P.L. 113-6. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems within the United States. The TSA is responsible for protecting transportation systems and assessing the risk of terrorist attacks. Their budget is complex, with various sources of funding including airline security fees. The TSA's budget includes airline security fee collections to offset aviation security costs, with $250 million allocated for screening technology investments. Other fees cover transportation threat assessment and credentialing costs. The President's budget request for TSA in FY2012 was $7,645 million, with $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, a 2.5% decrease from the previous year. The TSA's budget for FY2012 included $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represented a 2.5% decrease from the previous year. The proposed budget for aviation security was $5,099 million, with a decrease of $155 million (3.0%) compared to FY2012. Additionally, $124 million was proposed for Surface Transportation Security, a decrease of $10 million (7.8%) from FY2012. Requested funding decreases were due to planned reductions in procurement for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, as well as a reduction in screening technology maintenance costs. The FY2012 budget included a $10 million (7.8%) decrease in funding for Surface Transportation Security. The reduction in funding was due to planned decreases in procurement for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and a 50% cut in the Federal Flight Deck Officer program and flight crew training. Additionally, there was a $68 million (33%) increase in funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing, including a one-time $30 million increase for infrastructure modernization. Funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a $62 million (6%) decrease from FY2012 levels. The requested funding levels for Transportation Security Support and the Federal Air Marshals Service were decreased in FY2012. The House-passed bill included a gross budget authority of $7,498 million for TSA, with a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million, representing a decrease from the administration's request. The House-passed bill included a gross budget authority of $5,041 million for aviation security, $57 million less than requested. However, with a smaller offset, the appropriations for aviation security actually rose $58 million above the Administration's request. The bill also specified $126 million for surface transportation security, $2 million above the request but $8 million less than the FY2012 enacted amount. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. The House-passed bill specified funding for various security measures, including $193 million for TTAC and $929 million for transportation security support. Reductions were made to offset a budget shortfall caused by proposed passenger security fee increases. The Senate-reported bill proposed a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million for TSA, with a $211 million reduction in net appropriations compared to the Administration's request. This included $5,087 million for aviation security, $211 million less than requested. The bill accepted the proposed increases in passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million (7.3%) decrease in aviation security funding. The appropriations proposed in the bill for aviation security dropped $211 million (7.3%) from the Administration's request, including reductions in checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The FFDO program received $24 million, $12 million above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. P.L. 113-6 provided TSA with $7,551 million in total gross budget authority. The FFDO program received $12 million above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. P.L. 113-6 provided TSA with $7,551 million in total gross budget authority, $290 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration further reduced TSA budget authority by roughly an additional $339 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected gross total spending for TSA to be $7,212 million, $629 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. The department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, includes concerns about passenger security fees and proposed changes to the fee structure to double the fee on direct flights. Airlines have raised concerns about the potential impact on passenger air travel. The Administration proposed changing the fee structure to apply a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights. This change would increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. Previous administrations have also proposed increasing passenger security fees, but the current proposal has gained support from the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip for FY2013. The committee allocated all fee collections to aviation security, not deficit reduction. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional limitations. The committee did not include the proposal to increase passenger security fees, citing jurisdictional limitations. They had to find $115 million in offsets to make up for budget assumptions. TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies, raising questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. The TSA identified over $100 million in savings through management efficiencies, raising questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. Efficiency improvements are crucial for addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA, with initiatives such as risk-based screening programs like PreCheck and modified screening procedures for children and known flight crew members. The TSA has implemented modified screening procedures for children and trial programs for screening known flight crew members. These trial programs aim to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings. The PreCheck program, modeled after trusted traveler programs like Global Entry, is being expanded in FY2013. The PreCheck program, part of TSA's risk-based approach to screening, is being expanded in FY2013. Both House and Senate committees support the program's expansion, with a focus on increasing efficiency, reducing workforce requirements, and ensuring security measures for low-risk enrollees. The Senate committee expressed concern about the limited scope of TSA's known crew member pilot program and proposed expanding it to include flight attendants. TSA's efforts in behavioral-based observation and screening of passengers have faced scrutiny, with the House committee questioning the effectiveness of Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) and calling for a cost-benefit analysis of the program. The House committee report did not support increasing funds for Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) due to lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness in aviation security. They called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. The budget justification included a significant reduction in funds for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and crew member self-defense training, but this proposal was not adopted by the House or Senate Appropriations Committee. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the FFDO program at the FY2012 level. The House also passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in other areas. They directed the TSA to revisit the use of FFDOs and other federal law enforcement assets on commercial aircraft for better coordination and training. The Senate Appropriations Committee had a similar stance on the issue. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs, disagreeing with a request to reduce funding. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for security in U.S. ports and waterways. The Coast Guard is the primary federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for securing U.S. ports, waterways, and territorial waters. It also conducts missions such as search and rescue, environmental protection, and fisheries enforcement. The Coast Guard was transferred to the DHS in 2003, with a requested budget of $8,377 million for operating expenses and capital acquisitions. The House proposed $212 million more than the President's request, mainly for acquiring vessels, aircraft, and improving shore facilities. The Coast Guard budget for operating expenses and capital acquisitions was higher than the President's request, with differences in funding allocation for vessels, aircraft, and shore facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended even more funding, particularly for overseas contingency operations directly under the Coast Guard. Sequestration later reduced the USCG budget. The Coast Guard budget for operating expenses and acquisitions was higher than the President's request, with differences in funding allocation for vessels, aircraft, and shore facilities. Sequestration reduced USCG budget authority by roughly $268 million, resulting in a projected total spending of $10,132 million for FY2013. Table 13 outlines the funding levels for USCG functions, with the DHS Plan column showing budgetary resources available after sequestration as of April 26, 2013. Transfers and reprogramming may be undertaken to mitigate the impact of sequestration. The assessment of budgetary resources available through P.L. 113-6 after sequestration was applied as of April 26, 2013. The largest differences in FY2013 funding recommendations between the President's request and House and Senate bills concerned vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House and Senate bills funded more vessels and aircraft. The House and Senate bills provided funding for vessel and aircraft acquisition, with the Senate requesting $8 million for four new vessels. The House allocated $90 million for a long-range fixed-wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft and no funds for the helicopters. The DHS's sequestration operating plan included $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for a national security cutter, $319 million for fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. The DHS's sequestration plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, with $646 million for a national security cutter, $319 million for fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. For aircraft, there is a reduction in funding from $191 million to $181 million, with $86 million specifically for long-range aircraft. The House bill proposed $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, including $31 million to address a shore facilities backlog list. The House recommended $41 million more than the President's request for the Coast Guard, including $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for a new headquarters building. P.L. 113-6 provided $30 million for housing and aids to navigation, reduced to $29 million due to sequestration. The House also called for implementing card readers for TWIC and the Senate requested a briefing on Interagency Operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on actions taken regarding Interagency Operations Centers at ports in light of a GAO report critical of the agency's development of these centers. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two broad missions, criminal investigations and protection, including financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, computer fraud, and attacks on financial systems. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions: criminal investigations involving financial crimes, identity theft, and cyber attacks, and protection duties for the President, Vice President, their families, candidates, and designated individuals. They also provide security at National Special Security Events. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) is responsible for security activities at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and has two main missions: criminal investigations and protection duties for designated individuals. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with allocations for protection and investigation missions. The Administration requested $988 million for the USSS protection mission, $324 million for the investigation mission, and 7,061 FTE for personnel needs in FY2013. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, a decrease of $54 million from FY2012 but $12 million more than the Administration's request. The reduction in budget was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and decreased demand for candidate protection. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the USSS, reflecting a total decrease of $54 million from the previous year. This amount was $12 million above the Administration's request and included funding for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program. The Senate-approved DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 allocated $1.611 billion for the USSS, $56 million less than the previous year. After the sequester, the Service planned to spend $1.527 billion, reducing $84 million primarily from protection and investigation missions. The Secret Service's funding for FY2013 was reduced by $84 million from the allocated amount, primarily affecting its protection and investigation missions. The department's assessment of budgetary resources after sequestration was applied on April 26, 2013, shows potential ongoing issues for Congress regarding the balancing of the Service's investigative and protective missions. The Secret Service's protection mission employs most agents and resources, with congressional focus on recent agent misconduct. While Congress addresses financial crime investigations, the need for protection activities has increased due to potential threats. Advocates for expanding the investigation mission argue it enhances protection efforts. The President's actions have increased the need for the Service's protection activities. Advocates argue that better threat investigation efforts enhance protection. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. The requested budget for FY2013 is $5,911 million, with slight increases in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills. Both versions also include funding for disaster relief. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 would have provided $5,971 million, 1% above the request and 5.1% above FY2012. Both House-passed and Senate-reported versions also included $5,481 million for disaster relief offset by a BCA adjustment. P.L. 113-6 provides $5,920 million after cuts, an increase of 0.2% from the request and 4.3% above FY2012, with $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by a BCA adjustment. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed by the Secretary for Homeland Security in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes various offices such as the Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration has proposed moving the relief funds under the BCA. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) includes the Office of Infrastructure Protection, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, and other offices. The Administration has proposed relocating the US-VISIT program from NPPD. The House suggests keeping some functions in a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The Office of the Under Secretary is supported by the Management and Administration Program, while the Office of Infrastructure Protection and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications are supported by the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS), which includes projects on infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and communications. The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013, with a budget request of $1,167 million for the IPIS program, representing a 31.3% increase from FY2012. The increase in the IPIS budget was mainly for securing federal government information systems. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, a $278 million (31.3%) increase from FY2012. The budget increase focused on securing federal information systems, with major program increases for Federal Network Security and Network Security Deployment projects. The extra funding would support compliance with FISMA requirements and expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. The Network Security Deployment project aims to expand deployment of the NCPS intrusion detection system, with funding for version 3.0 for active defenses and version 2.2 for threat visualization. Additional funding includes $15 million for US-CERT to analyze data from NCPS and $5 million for MS-ISAC to support cybersecurity efforts at state and local levels. The FY2013 budget request included additional support for the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to assist state, local, territorial, and tribal governments in cybersecurity efforts. Funding for infrastructure protection and communications activities was reduced, with a significant cut in the Infrastructure Security Compliance project budget. This project ensures compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at covered facilities. The Administration reduced funding for infrastructure protection activities, including the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with $5 million less than requested for Management and Administration due to unauthorized TSA fee increases. The House proposed reduced funding for Management and Administration, citing unauthorized TSA fee increases and flaws in CBP fee revenue treatment. They also cut funding for the Security Compliance project and deployment of the NCPS due to program implementation issues and concerns about fund obligation. Additionally, the House directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and personnel management. The House proposed reducing funding for various projects, including the NCPS deployment, due to concerns about fund obligation. They also directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and personnel management. Other reductions included cuts to the Global Cybersecurity Management and Telecommunications projects. The House approved the full $202 million increase for the Federal Network Security project but directed NPPD to use the funds for developing security capabilities, including continuous monitoring. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration and IPIS. Additional funding was allocated for bombing prevention, vulnerability assessments, and the Security Compliance project. The Committee acknowledged unobligated funds for the project and stated that extra funds would be necessary for future implementation. The Committee recommended $18 million less than requested for the Federal Network Security project, with $120 million withheld until NPPD produces an expenditure plan. They also requested an explanation for the restructuring of the project to a more centralized structure managed by DHS. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for various cybersecurity projects, including setting aside $17 million for cybersecurity education and emphasizing the importance of improving the cybersecurity posture of state, local, territorial, and tribal governments. They also highlighted the need for annual National Cyber Security Reviews to track progress. The first National Cyber Security Review conducted by NPPD assessed cybersecurity capabilities of various government levels and recommended annual reviews for progress tracking. Funding increases were recommended for emergency communication projects, including the Next Generation Telecommunications project. P.L. 113-6 provided $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS program, and Biometric Identity Management. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million. According to the FY2013 operating plan, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million after sequestration. The plan indicates $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management for FY2014. Specific items for IPIS include funding for the Office of Bombing Prevention, vulnerability assessments, cybersecurity education, and CFATS. The FY2013 operating plan allocates funds for various programs including $16.9 million for cybersecurity education, $77.9 million for CFATS, and $202 million for Federal Network Security program to assist federal agencies with continuous monitoring and diagnostic equipment. GAO and the Coast Guard will continue to monitor DHS progress in developing the CFATS program. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act directs GAO and the Coast Guard to monitor DHS's progress in developing the CFATS program. It also requires NPPD to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and briefings on alternative security programs. Additionally, federal agencies must submit expenditure plans to improve cybersecurity, with quarterly reports sent to OMB for review. OMB will then provide a summary of these reports. Federal agencies are required to submit plans to improve cybersecurity, with quarterly reports sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. OMB will then provide an annual summary of these reports to Congress. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is assessing post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact of sequestration. An internal review by the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) identified issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program, prompting ongoing reviews and efforts to address the problems. Issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program were identified by an internal review by NPPD, prompting ongoing reviews and efforts to address the problems. Congress has shown interest in ensuring compliance with CFATS and may oversee this issue. Additionally, Congress has focused on cybersecurity during the 112th Congress, considering various bills related to information sharing, education, workforce development, and protecting critical infrastructure assets. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under NPPD, is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. Their operations focus on security and law enforcement to reduce vulnerability to threats. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) focuses on security and law enforcement activities to protect federally owned and leased buildings from criminal and terrorist threats. FPS conducts risk assessments, implements countermeasures, provides law enforcement response, and offers emergency and safety education programs. FPS is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and employs around 1,225 law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS, with funding coming from security fees charged to GSA building tenants. House-passed H.R. 5855 for FY2013 projected no specific changes to the FPS budget. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) budget for FY2013 included $509 million for building-specific security operations and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no specific changes to the FPS budget but required a briefing on management and budget improvement efforts. No specific changes were made in P.L. 113-6, but FPS was directed to update on progress in implementing GAO recommendations. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) budget for FY2013 included $509 million for building-specific security operations and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. Congress continues to express concern over certain aspects of the FPS mission and how FPS is funded. Several pieces of legislation were introduced in the House and Senate in the 112th Congress to improve federal building security and strengthen the ability of FPS. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance federal building security and FPS capabilities, but none were enacted. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735 aims to improve FPS staffing and pilot federal employee use over contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs oversees programs like BioWatch and NBIC. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) manages programs such as BioWatch and NBIC, with a budget of $167 million in FY2012. The requested funding for FY2013 is $166 million, supporting 101 FTEs. Allocation includes $125 million for BioWatch, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for Chemical Defense, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for other activities. The proposed allocation for FY2013 includes $125 million for the BioWatch program, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, $35 million less than FY2012, largely due to a decrease in funding for the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than FY2012, with recommended amounts for BioWatch. The Senate-reported bill recommended $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than FY2012, with small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, $35 million less than FY2012. The reductions in funding largely reflect decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. In FY2013, OHA did not face further budget reductions due to sequestration. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2012 and FY2013 reflect decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The DHS Plan column shows post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction in its report on FY2013 funding recommendations for DHS. The House Appropriations Committee recommended merging the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense to improve coordination of WMD activities. The Senate also emphasized the need for better coordination but did not issue a similar directive. The Senate explanatory statement reiterates the House Committee's comments about coordination of WMD activities and calls for a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including potential performance improvements and cost savings from merging OHA and DNDO. The review is due by September 1, 2013, in place of the House report request. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, accounts for most of OHA's budget and aims to deploy more advanced sensors for better pathogen detection. The BioWatch program, funded by OHA, aims to deploy advanced sensors to detect airborne pathogens quickly. However, the Gen-3 sensors have faced technical and management challenges, with a high estimated cost of $5.8 billion. Congressional appropriators have expressed concerns about the program's performance and funding, leading to limitations in program expansion. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is tasked with reducing loss of life and property from all hazards. It provides assistance for disaster response, recovery, and mitigation through various funds. Congressional appropriators have limited funding for program expansion, affecting the development of Gen-3 sensors for FY2013. FEMA provides assistance for disaster response, recovery, and mitigation through various funds. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FEMA for FY2013, an increase of $261 million over the enacted FY2012 level. Additionally, an adjustment of $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund was requested. The discretionary budget cap for FEMA in FY2013 was adjusted under the Budget Control Act, with the House-passed H.R. 5855 providing $4,451 million, a decrease from the President's request. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed $4,582 million, an increase from the President's request. Both included funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $4,582 million for FEMA in FY2013, an increase from the President's request and FY2012. The funding included $1 million less than requested for the Disaster Relief Fund due to across-the-board cuts. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. The full range of appropriated resources available to FEMA includes a significant infusion of capital from P.L. 113-2. State and local governments have primary responsibility for domestic public safety functions and may reduce resources during fiscal challenges. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. President Obama issued a directive for DHS to develop a national preparedness goal in coordination with various government levels. The national preparedness goal, as directed by Presidential Policy Directive 8, involves developing core capabilities to mitigate specific threats and vulnerabilities. This directive supersedes a previous homeland security directive and aims to enhance the United States' readiness to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks. The National Preparedness Goal, as directed by Presidential Policy Directive 8, aims to strengthen the United States' readiness to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks and other emergencies. It defines success as a secure and resilient nation with the capabilities to mitigate threats and hazards. The National Preparedness Goal, directed by Presidential Policy Directive 8, defines success as a secure and resilient nation with capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to threats. Before 9/11, only three federal grant programs existed for homeland security. Since then, additional programs like SHSGP, CCP, UASI, and REAL ID were added to enhance state and local preparedness. Several homeland security grant programs were added post-9/11 to enhance state and local preparedness, including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security, Over-the-Road, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Federal assistance for preparedness activities is a small percentage of overall state and local spending for public safety. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, $400 million more than was appropriated for FY2012. This funding would support the establishment of a National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP). The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, including funding for a National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP). However, the House Appropriations Committee denied the request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs due to lack of authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns about the consolidation proposal. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the President's proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants for FY2013, citing lack of authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns about the consolidation proposal and uncertainty surrounding funding allocation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and recommending the grant structure enacted in FY2012 to continue in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the consolidation proposal for state and local preparedness grants in FY2013, recommending $1.7 billion for various grant programs under the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. This includes funding for Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and specific security assistance programs. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $1.7 billion for various grant programs under the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. This includes funding for Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and specific security assistance programs, with allocations for education, training, and exercises. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $1.7 billion for various grant programs under the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, including funding for Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security/Bus Assistance, Port Security Grants, and education, training, and exercises. The budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program was reduced by $77 million due to sequestration, with projected funding of $1,400 million for state and local programs. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $1.7 billion for various grant programs under the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program was reduced by $77 million due to sequestration, with projected funding of $1,400 million for state and local programs. P.L. 113-6 removes a transfer from the grant programs that had paid FEMA's administrative costs, resulting in $132 million higher funding available for grants compared to FY2012 levels. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance grants. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. A percentage of AFG funding may be set aside for grant program management. Grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office starting in FY2013. SAFER grants can be used to maintain firefighter staffing levels. The Administration requested legislative language for SAFER grants to maintain firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill also proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million for AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS was granted SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The DRF is funded yearly through regular appropriations, but often depleted before the fiscal year ends due to high demand for disaster assistance. This reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding the DRF, leading to arguments for increased funding. In recent years, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has relied on supplemental funding due to underfunding, leading to arguments for increased funding. The average monthly expenditures for the DRF between 2005 and 2011 were $383 million, while the Administration requested $6,088 million for FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. $608 million was requested for activities not directly tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) included a $6,400 million supplemental. The request can be categorized into two parts: $608 million for non-major disaster activities and $5,481 million for major disaster relief costs under the Stafford Act. This reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing these costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request was over three times larger than the previous year's request. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was more than three times larger than the previous year's request. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate-reported bills funded the DRF at the Administration's requested level for FY2013. Additionally, both bills included an unrequested transfer of $24 million from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. After adjustments, P.L. 113-6 allocated $7,007 million to the DRF. The FY2013 budget allocated $7,007 million to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with an additional $24 million transferred to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits on disaster-related spending. Despite the transfer, this amount was $918 million more than the Administration's initial request. Sequestration later reduced the DRF budget to $6,653 million. The FY2013 budget allocated $7,007 million to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which was later reduced to $6,653 million due to sequestration. The Budget Control Act includes provisions for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to prevent sequestration triggered by exceeding discretionary budget caps. It's important to differentiate between \"disaster relief\" funding under the BCA and the DRF, as the former is for activities related to major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received $7.3 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, from a continuing resolution and allowable adjustment for disaster relief. The government allocated additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2013 due to high demand, exceeding the allowable adjustment for disaster relief. Congress approved $11,485 million in extra resources through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, to cover the shortfall. Emergency funding designations were provided to address the remaining relief needed beyond the allowable adjustment. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund received all available funding under the Budget Control Act's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. The Administration proposed eliminating the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, stating it duplicated the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The PDM program awarded funds before disasters, unlike the HMGP. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM) is funded separately from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and addresses all types of hazards, not just flood hazards like the National Flood Insurance Program. The Administration proposed phasing out the PDM program, but there is still over $174 million in unobligated balances to continue awarding grants. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills did not include language to end the program, but they did signal concerns about the slow pace of awards. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills proposed reduced funding for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM) due to slow award pace and large unobligated balance. The post-sequester amount for PDM in FY2013 is around $25 million, presenting challenges for program administration and funding state minimum awards. Reduced award amounts make a new round of applications and awards impractical. The Administration has faced challenges in funding the EFS program due to reduced award amounts and slow award pace. FEMA may use existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle. The proposed funding for FY2013 is $100 million, a reduction from the previous year. The House has suggested maintaining funding at $120 million, while the Senate has proposed increasing it to $150 million. In FY2012, Congress funded the EFS program at $120 million, $20 million over the requested level. For FY2013, the House has kept funding at $120 million, while the Senate proposed raising it to $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arise from delayed fund distribution in FY2012, taking nine months to begin distributing assistance, double the time directed by the authorizing legislation. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The requested amount for FY2013 was $1,561 million, with the House-passed bill providing $1,510 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $1,535 million. The enacted amount after cuts was $1,520 million. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 provided $1,520 million for USCIS, which handles immigration petitions, naturalization, and refugee/asylum claims. The USCIS receives direct appropriations for family-based petitions, employment-based petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, and related humanitarian concerns. Fee income is not included in the appropriations. USCIS funds its operations through revenues generated by the Examinations Fee Account, transforming its revenue structure in the last decade. The USCIS receives direct appropriations for various petitions and humanitarian concerns. It funds its operations through the Examinations Fee Account, with most revenue coming from adjudication fees. The requested budget authority for FY2013 was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The requested direct appropriation for FY2013 is $143 million, including funds for the E-Verify program, Immigrant Integration Initiative, and the SAVE Program. The remaining budget authority of $2,862 million is expected to be funded by fee collections. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a USCIS gross budget authority of $3,004 million for FY2013, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed USCIS gross budget authority for FY2013 at $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The recommended level did not include funds for the requested pay increase and directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and at least $29 million towards fee revenues. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and at least $29 million towards digital conversion of immigration records. They also directed USCIS to codify an agreement with DoD for funding military naturalizations. The House Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a budget of $2,999 million for USCIS in FY2013, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. They recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants. The Committee directed USCIS to allocate $20 million for the SAVE program and to use user fee revenues for it. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program. They also recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants, with an additional $5 million to be made available via fees. The Committee directed that no appropriations be used for the Office of Citizenship Services and expressed concern about the costs of administering the grant program. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $114 million, a decrease of $29 million from the requested amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $114 million for the program, a decrease from the requested amount. Sequestration may further reduce funding to $109 million. The FY2013 budget cycle for USCIS included concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. The House Committee directed USCIS to include operational costs like asylum. USCIS must accurately monitor fee revenues and obligations to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. The House Committee directed USCIS to include operational costs like asylum in fee assessments and to provide quarterly briefings on fee revenues. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains a congressional issue, with the Administration requesting $11 million in appropriations but the House and Senate Committees stating that program funding should come from fee revenue. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 requires USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds for immigrant integration grants in FY2013, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations allocated for the same purpose. The House Committee expressed disappointment with USCIS's lack of progress on the Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract. Despite allocating funds for immigrant integration grants, none can be used for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Committee questioned the justification for continued investment in the current contract for USCIS's Transformation program, which has delivered little capability. Congress extended E-Verify authorization for one year and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations to prevent false identifications. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its implementation. The House Committee directed USCIS to create a review process for E-Verify final non-confirmations and report on the cost of expanding E-Verify. They also discussed challenges in agriculture such as non-office-based hiring and limited internet access. The Committee emphasized the need to increase efficiency, reduce expenses, and avoid the loss of personal documentation. The House Committee directed USCIS to convert immigration records to digital format through EDMS and eliminate paper versions of USCIS Form I-94. They also urged DHS to review refugee processing for streamlining while maintaining security vetting. The Committee urged DHS to streamline refugee processing for vulnerable individuals needing resettlement in the US, while maintaining security vetting. They also encouraged the use of parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs, such as family unity and medical emergencies after natural disasters. Additionally, they called for sufficient resources to respond to future deadly disasters.

The S&T Directorate received $834 million in funding after across-the-board rescissions, with $28 million less than the request for RDI. The DHS was directed to provide a breakdown of RDI funding by thrust area. Additionally, $37 million more than the request was allocated for Laboratory Facilities, to be used for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total funding for the S&T Directorate was reported as $801 million. The DHS Plan column outlines post-sequester funding levels for existing S&T program functions, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact.

The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. The accompanying report lacked the House language about the plan being an annual requirement and did not address the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. P.L. 113-6 provides $318 million for DNDO after rescissions, with $9 million less than the request for Transformational R&D. The act directs DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture, but it is unclear if this should be an annual requirement. The explanatory statement also directs DHS to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation. The explanatory statement directs DHS to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined for existing program functions.

Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and payment liquidation. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with obligations incurred when federal agencies spend funds. Outlays represent actual spending in a fiscal year, which may not always align with the budget authority enacted. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. The federal agency's spending includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. An example within DHS is the Coast Guard retirement pay. Offset funds are collected by the federal government from government accounts or the public. The Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset agency discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending, typically entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, there are offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds not appropriated by Congress. The Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated along with other entitlements in the DHS budget. Offset Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, not appropriated by Congress, are included in the President's budget for gross budget authority calculation. Homeland security funding has seen increased interest since 9/11, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism now including homeland security analysis. The annual report to Congress on combating terrorism now includes homeland security analysis, with a more refined funding analysis. While DHS funding is a significant portion of federal spending on homeland security, it does not encompass all efforts in this area. In FY2012, DHS accounted for nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security, with the Department of Defense being the next highest contributor. The DHS homeland security budget for FY2012 comprised nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security, with the Department of Defense following at nearly 26%. Other top agencies in spending included the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, and Department of State, collectively accounting for approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is solely for homeland security activities. The FY2012 DHS budget included $35.1 billion for homeland security activities out of a total budget authority of $52.5 billion. The budget amounts in Table B-1 may not align with total amounts in the report due to inconsistencies. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available yet."
