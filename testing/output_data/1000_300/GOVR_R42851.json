    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Previous court cases have established the need for a connection between a state and the transaction being taxed. In two separate cases, preliminary injunctions were granted against the PACT Act. In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, federal courts granted preliminary injunctions against the PACT Act, stating that requiring remote retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts violates due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the injunction in Red Earth, while the case in Gordon is pending appeal. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, a different federal court rejected the due process argument. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will review the preliminary injunction in Gordon on appeal. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, a federal court rejected the due process argument, stating that the PACT Act is a federal statute requiring compliance with state laws and does not violate due process. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficient contacts with the jurisdictions where it shipped tobacco products through its website. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court's ruling in Quill suggests that Congress cannot require remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act hinges on what constitutes minimum contacts for remote retailers, as noted in Quill regarding catalogue retailers. Minimum contacts depend on the retailer's purposeful economic activities in the forum state. The Supreme Court has stated that minimum contacts for out-of-state defendants depend on purposeful economic activities in the forum state. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of tobacco products to increase tax collection and reduce youth access to cheap cigarettes. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by deeming interstate sales as intrastate sales, ensuring compliance with state and local laws, including excise taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. The PACT Act regulates remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by enforcing state and local laws, including excise taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. It also requires remote sellers to pay all applicable taxes and apply required stamps before delivery. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act regulates remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, enforcing state and local laws on taxes, licensing, and sales restrictions. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Due Process Clause prohibits states from imposing taxes on foreign businesses without a sufficient connection to the state. Remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, citing the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill on out-of-state tax collection. The PACT Act regulates remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, enforcing state and local laws on taxes, licensing, and sales restrictions. Remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, citing the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill on out-of-state tax collection. The Court's opinion in Quill considered the requirement of minimum contacts for out-of-state businesses to collect use tax in a state, stating that physical presence is not necessary for jurisdiction. The Court upheld Florida courts' jurisdiction over an out-of-state franchisee conducting business remotely in Florida, stating that physical presence is not necessary for jurisdiction if business activities are purposefully directed towards residents of another State. The Court has consistently rejected the idea that physical presence is required for personal jurisdiction if a business's activities are purposefully directed towards residents of another State. In the case of Quill, the Court found that sending catalogues to North Dakota residents constituted purposeful direction of activities, satisfying the minimum contacts requirement. The key issue under Quill is whether the out-of-state business has directed its activities at the taxing state and has fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians operating tobacco retail businesses sought an injunction for their online and mail order sales. In Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians who own tobacco retail businesses sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements. The plaintiffs argued that the Act violated due process by subjecting them to taxing jurisdictions without sufficient minimum contacts. The United States contended that the plaintiffs' online advertising and shipping activities established minimum contacts. The plaintiffs in Red Earth argued that the PACT Act did not violate due process because their online advertising and shipping activities established minimum contacts. However, the district court disagreed, pointing out that not all plaintiffs had websites and that the websites were passive, serving as virtual catalogs without the ability to complete purchases online. The court determined that a passive website does not establish minimum contacts for online purchases, requiring a money order for consummation. It also rejected the argument that shipment into a state satisfies minimum contacts for tax collection. The court rejected the idea that a single sale could establish minimum contacts for tax collection, citing previous cases that supported the opposite view. They emphasized that the Supreme Court in Quill focused on continuous solicitation of business rather than isolated sales to determine jurisdiction. The court's decision focused on the defendant's sale into the state rather than continuous solicitation of business within North Dakota. The court found that the PACT Act violated the Due Process Clause by broadening jurisdictional reach without minimum contacts. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was appealed by the government to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, stating that requiring a vendor to collect taxes based on a single sale may violate due process. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale is sufficient to establish jurisdiction. The federal courts have avoided deciding if a single sale satisfies due process requirements. The Supreme Court has not determined if one sale is enough. In Musser's case, a tobacco retailer sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act. The district court's decision was upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In Musser's case, a tobacco retailer sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act, arguing that the Act requires retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions, violating the Due Process Clause. The district court denied the injunction, stating that the tax-payment requirement is imposed by Congress, not by individual states, and must be analyzed accordingly. Congress, not individual states, imposes tax-payment requirements on interstate businesses engaging in commerce. This legislative due process analysis reflects the federal nature of the legislation, allowing Congress to mandate compliance with state and local laws for businesses operating across state lines. This requirement does not violate due process and falls within Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. The court's analysis conflates Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause with state taxation of out-of-state businesses. The plaintiff was found to have minimum contacts in all 50 states due to its interactive website. The court used the sliding scale approach from Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. to determine this. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. discusses the spectrum of personal jurisdiction on the internet, ranging from clear business activities to passive websites. The level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information on interactive websites determines jurisdiction. In Musser's case, the court found the plaintiff had sufficient contacts for jurisdiction. In Musser's case, the court found that selling products over the Internet and conducting business through an interactive website in a state is sufficient contact to satisfy due process concerns. Minimum contacts could be satisfied by a single sale transacted through an interactive website. The court found that selling products through an interactive website can satisfy due process concerns, as seen in Musser's case. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. The district court initially denied Gordon's motion as untimely, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed and remanded the decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's decision on Gordon's motion, stating that the motion was timely and that Due Process violations can occur even with state levies based on minimum contacts. The Court emphasized that Due Process and Commerce Clause issues should be treated separately, and national legislation cannot violate principles of fair play and substantial justice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's decision on Gordon's motion, emphasizing that Due Process and Commerce Clause issues are analytically distinct. National legislation cannot violate principles of fair play and substantial justice. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, to comply with the PACT Act. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, to comply with the PACT Act. The court distinguished previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to the jurisdiction of any particular states, stating that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected this argument. The court found that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument that Congress can authorize violations of the Due Process Clause in interstate commerce cases. The Musser's court collapsed the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the PACT Act challenge, following the D.C. Circuit's rejection of the government's similar argument. The court reviewed key due process cases on personal jurisdiction, emphasizing minimum contacts and fair play. Personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another state. The court emphasized the importance of fair play and substantial justice in personal jurisdiction cases, citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. It highlighted that jurisdiction can be established when a commercial actor's actions are purposefully directed towards residents of another state, creating a substantial connection with the forum state. The court emphasized that engaging in significant activities or creating continuing obligations in a state avails the defendant of the privilege of conducting business there, making it not unreasonable to require them to submit to litigation in that forum. The district court emphasized that a defendant availing themselves of the privilege of conducting business in a forum state should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there, as highlighted in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The focus on foreseeability in personal jurisdiction cases is crucial for fair play and substantial justice. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, stating that defendants should reasonably anticipate being sued in a forum state. This focus on predictability allows defendants to structure their conduct with assurance of where they may be liable. In Quill, the Court required a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax, ensuring a rational connection to the taxing state's values. The Supreme Court emphasized foreseeability in due process analysis, requiring a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax. In Quill, the Court found that Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota, meeting the due process requirement. However, the Quill standard was not met in Gordon, as the business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market of the states it sold products to. The court in Gordon did not meet the Quill standard as the business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market of the states it sold products to. The district court also did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing state. The court emphasized that the taxing power exerted by the state should bear a fiscal relation to the protection, opportunities, and benefits provided by the state. The court in Gordon found that the PACT Act may violate due process as it does not show a clear connection between the state's taxing power and the benefits received by the business. Congress may have overstepped its authority under the Commerce Clause by allowing states to tax out-of-state businesses. The PACT Act may subject out-of-state businesses to state laws that could violate the Commerce Clause, but it might not comply with the Due Process Clause if it allows taxation without minimum contacts. Courts have analyzed its constitutionality under the Due Process Clause, questioning if it authorizes state taxation of retailers without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may have mixed up the Commerce Clause and due process analyses, suggesting the PACT Act does not raise due process concerns. However, it remains uncertain how higher courts will interpret the due process analysis, especially regarding a single sale into a state. The PACT Act may raise concerns under the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause, with uncertainty on whether a single sale into a state meets the minimum contacts requirement for due process. The opinion in Musser's may have conflated these analyses, suggesting the PACT Act does not implicate due process concerns. However, higher courts' interpretation of due process regarding a single sale remains unclear."
