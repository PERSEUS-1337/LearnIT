The Congress declares the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming more accessible to shipping due to thinning ice cover and technological advancements. It is in the interest of the United States to ensure safe shipping in the Arctic while protecting the natural environment and the needs of Arctic resource users. The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean, protect the environment and wildlife, support legitimate research vessels, and establish international cooperation for reliable shipping. The United States seeks to establish international cooperation for reliable shipping in the Arctic, including investments in navigation aids, ports of refuge, communication, mapping, and search and rescue capabilities. Coordinated shipping regulations are necessary to protect U.S. interests from potential risks posed by increased shipping activity in the region. The United States requires coordinated shipping regulations to protect its interests in the Arctic, including the need for icebreaker platforms for research, security, and commercial activities. Existing models of international cooperation, such as joint administration of waterways and cooperation with other countries, can serve as examples for managing shipping in the region. The United States needs new icebreakers to replace aging ones for Arctic interests. International cooperation is essential for coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention. Starting these efforts now is crucial after the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council. The United States needs new icebreakers for Arctic interests and international cooperation is crucial for shipping regulations and oil spill prevention. Initiating efforts now, following the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, is vital to protect US interests in the Arctic Ocean. SEC. 3. ARCTIC MARINE SHIPPING ASSESSMENT IMPLEMENTATION. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to negotiate agreements through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action among Arctic nations for the placement and maintenance of aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, and maritime domain awareness. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System coordinates domestic transportation policies in the Arctic for safe maritime shipping, including aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, maritime domain awareness, and search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates may enter agreements or contracts to support these efforts. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates may enter agreements or contracts to support safe maritime navigation, including icebreaking where needed. Additionally, the Secretary of Transportation may conduct demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels operating in the Arctic. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates may enter agreements or contracts to support safe maritime navigation, including icebreaking where needed. Authorization of appropriations is provided for seasonal operations in the Arctic and training mariners for ice navigation and Arctic operations. Authorization of appropriations is provided for seasonal operations in the Arctic, including $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2012-2015 for agreements under subsection (d) and $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2011-2015 for demonstration projects. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers. The Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers and constructing new ones for Arctic missions. This includes analyzing the impact on mission capacity and the ability to maintain a presence in the Arctic regions. The Coast Guard must analyze the impact on mission capacity and the ability to maintain a presence in the Arctic regions through 2020 if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to submit a report containing the results of the study to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of the Act or the completion of the ongoing High Latitude Study. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of the Act, containing the results of the ongoing High Latitude Study on Arctic ice-breaking mission requirements and recommendations for future actions. The Commandant must submit reports with analysis results and recommendations to Congress under the Act. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. The Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report within 270 days to assess the need for more Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions, covering areas like search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report should include evaluations of current Coast Guard assets and projected needs for forward operating bases in these regions. The report will assess the Coast Guard's capabilities in high latitude regions, including the need for forward operating bases, icebreaking capability, and performance goals of current assets. The report will evaluate the Coast Guard's high latitude icebreaking fleet's performance, capability to meet future goals, and the condition of assets. It will also provide cost estimates for acquiring and operating additional assets in high latitude regions for all Coast Guard mission areas. The report will provide detailed cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability, including renovating and modernizing the existing fleet and replacing it. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act refers to the definition in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
