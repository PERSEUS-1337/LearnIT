    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patents involving human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. The courts and USPTO have traditionally interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The courts have long held implicit exceptions to patentable subject matter, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Recent Supreme Court decisions have increased the use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject applications at the USPTO. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has led to concerns about the validity of patents granted under earlier standards. Some observers believe the Supreme Court decisions have created confusion and chaos in the patent system, with the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit criticizing the departure from sensible patent policy. The recent Supreme Court decisions on patentable subject matter have been criticized for creating chaos in the patent system. Some believe these decisions may lead to patents of appropriate scope and discourage abusive patent litigation. Legislative reform proposals are also being reviewed to address these concerns. The report discusses Supreme Court decisions on patentable subject matter, implications in information technology and life sciences industries, and legislative reform options. Applicants must submit detailed patent applications to the USPTO for examination by officials known as examiners. The process, known as \"prosecution,\" requires a thorough description of the invention and drafting of specific claims. The patent acquisition process, known as \"prosecution,\" involves submitting detailed patent applications to the USPTO for examination. Examiners review the application to determine if the claimed invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires that the invention is not fully anticipated by prior art, while nonobviousness means the invention is not readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan based on prior art teachings. The invention must also be useful to satisfy patent requirements. To be patentable, an invention must be nonobvious and useful, not readily within ordinary skills based on prior art. Section 101 of the Patent Act defines patentable subject matter as any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. A process patent claims a series of steps to achieve a specific result, typically related to methods of manufacture or use. It may involve making a product or using a chemical compound for treatment. The other patentable subject matter categories include products like machines and manufactures. The Supreme Court has defined \"machine\" as any mechanical device or combination to perform a function, and \"manufacture\" as the production of articles from raw materials. The term \"manufacture\" refers to the production of articles from raw materials, while \"composition of matter\" includes all compositions of substances. Courts have set limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The USPTO has limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court views these as essential tools for scientific and technological work, meant to be free for all and not reserved exclusively. If a patent application meets requirements, it will be granted, giving the proprietor the right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing the invention. The USPTO grants patents for inventions that meet requirements, giving the proprietor exclusive rights for twenty years. This allows inventors to profit from their discoveries and enforce their intellectual property rights. A patent proprietor monitors competitors for infringement and may need to litigate in federal courts to enforce intellectual property rights. Accused infringers can challenge a patent's validity, with the Federal Circuit handling most patent appeals and the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Recent Supreme Court decisions have addressed patentable subject matter, with landmark cases in 1980 and 1981 allowing for the patenting of genetically engineered microorganisms and other inventions. The Supreme Court last addressed patentable subject matter nearly four decades ago in landmark cases from 1980 and 1981, allowing for the patenting of genetically engineered microorganisms and other inventions. Since then, lower courts and USPTO rarely used Section 101 to invalidate patents. However, the Supreme Court revisited the issue in a series of decisions from 2010 to 2014, ruling inventions unpatentable under Section 101. The Supreme Court revisited patentable subject matter in a series of decisions from 2010 to 2014, ruling inventions unpatentable under Section 101. In its 2010 decision Bilski v. Kappos, the Court considered the patentability of a method of hedging risk in commodities trading. The Court rejected a patent application for a method of managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading, stating it was ineligible for patenting under Section 101. The Federal Circuit questioned whether the applicants were seeking patent protection. The Federal Circuit rejected a patent application for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading, citing it as ineligible for patenting under Section 101. The court questioned if the applicants were trying to claim a fundamental principle or a mental process. The application did not meet the criteria for patent eligibility as it was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus. The Court of Appeals rejected Bilski's patent application as it did not satisfy the Section 101 inquiry criteria. The claimed process did not involve a physical transformation, leading to the USPTO's decision being affirmed. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case, with no majority agreement among the Justices. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on Bilski's patent application. Justice Kennedy authored the opinion for the Court, stating that Bilski's invention could not be patented as it involved a fundamental economic practice. The Court rejected the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. The Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application, stating that hedging was a fundamental economic practice not eligible for patenting. Justice Stevens concurred, suggesting that methods of doing business should not be covered by patent law. Justice Breyer identified four points of agreement among all nine justices. In a Section 101 case, the Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application, stating that methods of doing business are not covered by patent law. Justice Breyer identified four points of agreement among all nine justices, including the broad but limited range of patentable subject matter and the machine-or-transformation test for determining patentability. The Court then shifted focus to the life sciences in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court focused on patents related to determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune diseases. The patents claim methods of administering the drug, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting dosage based on the comparison of metabolite levels. The `623 patent involves optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and adjusting dosage based on metabolite levels in red blood cells. The Supreme Court ruled that claims related to adjusting drug dosage based on metabolite levels in red blood cells were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Court emphasized that patenting natural phenomena could impede innovation. The Supreme Court ruled that claims adjusting drug dosage based on metabolite levels were unpatentable as they involved natural laws. The Court recognized the importance of not impeding innovation by patenting natural phenomena. The Supreme Court ruled that adjusting drug dosage based on metabolite levels was unpatentable as it involved natural laws. The Court determined that the claimed inventions did not add enough to qualify as patent-eligible processes. Justice Breyer explained that the steps of \"administering\" and \"determining\" were not sufficient to make the inventions patentable. The Supreme Court ruled that adjusting drug dosage based on metabolite levels was unpatentable as it involved natural laws. Justice Breyer stated that advising physicians to measure metabolite levels and take account of natural laws did not make the inventions patentable. The Court concluded that the steps in the claim did not transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising individuals to use natural laws does not make inventions patentable. The Court rejected the argument that the patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test, stating that the claims only required measuring metabolite levels, not transforming human blood or the body. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that patents cannot be granted based on advising individuals to use natural laws. The Court clarified that the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability, as the claims only required measuring metabolite levels. Justice Breyer emphasized that Section 101 standards should not be easily satisfied, and other patentability requirements like novelty and nonobviousness play a significant role in determining patent issuance. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. The Court was reluctant to depart from precedent denying patents on natural laws, despite concerns about discouraging diagnostic research and limiting physician access to scientific data. In a 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA cannot be patented under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. This doctrine prohibits patenting preexisting substances found in the wild, unless significant artificial changes are made. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA by purifying or altering it. However, some experts disagreed, stating that patenting human genes misinterpreted the \"product of nature\" principle. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad challenged the patenting of human genes, specifically BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancers. The lawsuit was filed by the Association for Molecular Pathology and other plaintiffs against the USPTO, Myriad Genetics, Inc., and the University of Utah Research Foundation. The plaintiffs challenged Myriad's patents on isolated human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad held intellectual property rights for genetic testing related to these genes. The U.S. District Court ruled the gene patents invalid, stating isolated DNA was not significantly different from native DNA. New York ruled that Myriad's gene patent claims were invalid as isolated DNA was not markedly different from native DNA. The Federal Circuit reversed this decision, stating that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Federal Circuit once again upheld Myriad's claims, leading to the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. Justice Thomas stated that Myriad did not create anything by isolating the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and therefore, their claims were not patentable. The Court was unimpressed by Myriad's argument that isolated DNA was different from native DNA. The Supreme Court found that isolating DNA from the human genome is not an act of invention. They rejected Myriad's claims that isolated DNA was different from native DNA. However, the Court did view synthetic DNA, known as cDNA, more favorably as it is not considered a \"product of nature\" and therefore could be patented. The Supreme Court found that cDNA, which is distinct from naturally occurring DNA, could be patented as it is not considered a \"product of nature.\" The Court clarified that the Myriad opinion did not address innovative gene manipulation methods or altered DNA sequences, but rather focused on the patent eligibility of isolated genes and the information they encode. Justice Thomas's opinion was supported by seven colleagues. The Supreme Court clarified that isolated genes and the information they encode are not patent eligible under \u00a7101. Justice Scalia concurred with the judgment but disagreed on the molecular biology details. He noted that cDNA could be patented as it is a synthetic creation not found in nature. In a recent decision, the Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank. In Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system designed to mitigate settlement risk. The district court ruled the inventions unpatentable as they represented a basic business or financial concept. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents related to computer-implemented inventions were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained that the Court's precedent established a two-part test for identifying such patents. The Federal Circuit upheld the decision that patents related to computer-implemented inventions were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying such patents, focusing on whether the claim incorporates an \"inventive concept\" beyond applying the excluded subject matter to a specific technological environment. The Supreme Court analyzed whether the method claims in question contained an \"inventive concept\" beyond applying the abstract idea of intermediated settlement to a computer environment. It was determined that the patented claims did not meet this requirement, as they were deemed to be nothing more than the implementation of an abstract idea on a computer. Justice Thomas emphasized that simply using a generic computer does not make an abstract idea eligible for a patent. The Supreme Court found that the patented claims were merely implementing an abstract idea on a computer, which did not make them eligible for a patent. Justice Thomas emphasized that incorporating generic computer hardware does not transform an abstract idea into a patentable invention. The Court rejected the claims involving computer systems and computer-readable media for the same reason, as they did not provide meaningful technological limitations. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The courts and USPTO use a two-part test to determine eligibility, considering if the claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if the claim includes additional inventive elements. The Court also analyzes if a patent claim preempts a field of activity. The Court analyzes patent claims to determine if they preempt a field of activity, considering if they cover every practical application of a fundamental concept. The recitation of routine hardware does not affect Section 101 eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost in decision-making. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation without a formal claim construction. Section 101 determinations in patent litigation can be resolved early without formal claim construction. Statistical analyses show a high rate of challenged patent invalidation under \u00a7101 motions, with an average invalidation rate of 66.5%. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 patent applications under Alice, with over 5,000 abandoned. The statistics show a high rate of challenged patent invalidation under \u00a7101 motions, with an average invalidation rate of 66.5%. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 patent applications under Alice, with over 5,000 abandoned. These statistics suggest that attorneys have a good chance of success when asserting that a patent claim is invalid. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted patent validity in various industries such as chemicals, consumer devices, electronics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, tools, and vehicles. The courts have invalidated numerous patents on computer-related inventions following the standards set in Bilski and Alice. Patent claims that lack specific solutions or improvements in technology are most vulnerable to challenges under Section 101. Patent claims vulnerable to Section 101 challenges include those for a computer system generating menus, collecting electric power grid information, extracting data from hard copy documents, administering life insurance policies, and tracking policy values. The patent invalidated in a representative decision claimed a broadcast system allowing out-of-region access to local broadcasts via a cellular telephone. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system that provides out-of-region access to local broadcasts via a cellular telephone. The court deemed the concept abstract and noted that the patent did not describe how the invention accomplished the claimed functions. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone, deeming the concept abstract and lacking description of how the invention achieved its functions. The court highlighted that the patent confined the idea to cellular telephones, which did not satisfy Section 101 requirements. The Federal Circuit has upheld patents in cases involving e-commerce systems, information management, Internet content filtering, and animation methods, emphasizing the importance of avoiding broad functional language and including discrete structures in claims to survive Section 101 challenges. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, particularly in the patentability of predictive diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances like genes and proteins. Slightly altered genes and naturally derived substances are more likely to pass patent eligibility requirements under \u00a7101. The 2015 ruling of the Federal Circuit in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. involved a non-invasive pre-natal diagnostic method for determining fetal gender, blood type, and genetic disorders. Sequenom held U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540 for detecting paternally inherited fetal nucleic acid. Sequenom held U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540 for detecting paternally inherited fetal nucleic acid in a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method. The Federal Circuit ruled that the invention of detecting cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum failed the patentable subject matter test. Inventors developed a method to detect paternally inherited ccfDNA in maternal plasma or serum for fetal characteristics. The Federal Circuit found the invention ineligible for patent as it focused on a naturally occurring phenomenon and used conventional techniques. Judge Linn supported the decision but highlighted the significance of the breakthrough in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Judge Linn supported the decision that the invention was ineligible for patent due to its focus on a naturally occurring phenomenon and the use of conventional techniques. However, he emphasized the importance of the breakthrough in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Congress has options to address the law of patentable subject matter, with industry associations suggesting modifications to Section 101. No bill has been introduced since the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011. Industry associations have proposed changes to Section 101, with the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) suggesting similar modifications. The AIPLA's proposal aims to replace the existing Section 101 with new language regarding patent eligibility criteria. The American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Intellectual Property Law has proposed changes to Section 101, focusing on patent eligibility criteria. The proposal aims to amend Section 101 to specify conditions for patentability, emphasizing eligible subject matter. The American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Intellectual Property Law has proposed amending Section 101 to specify conditions for patentability, emphasizing eligible subject matter. The proposal includes criteria for patent eligibility, focusing on preempting the use of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The American Bar Association's proposal aims to amend Section 101 to establish conditions for patentability, emphasizing eligible subject matter and focusing on preempting the use of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The AIPLA argues that Section 101 should serve as an \"enabling provision\" rather than a standard for determining patent protection for technical advances. The AIPLA, ABA, and IPO criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility determinations by applying criteria like 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' which they argue should be left to novelty and obviousness considerations. They believe Section 101 should act as an enabling provision, not a standard for patent protection. The IPO criticizes the Supreme Court's analysis of patent eligibility, calling it restrictive and contrary to congressional intent. Some believe that legislative reform is unnecessary, as restrictive rules have not impacted innovation or investment. Proposed amendments could potentially eliminate constraints on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal would change patent eligibility standards, potentially eliminating common law standards like \"obviousness-type double patenting.\" Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has sparked debate, with Section 101 seen as balancing innovation and patent rights. The debate over patent eligibility standards, particularly in fields like AI and biotech, has sparked concerns about the balance between innovation and patent rights. Some experts argue that Section 101 maintains this balance, while others fear that limiting patent rights could hinder innovation and investment in the US. This ongoing debate may lead to further examination of what types of inventions should be eligible for patents."
