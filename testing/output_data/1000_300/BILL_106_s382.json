    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Establishment Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile launch control facility and launch facility known as \"Delta 1\" and \"Delta 9\" are significant examples of American history during the Cold War.
