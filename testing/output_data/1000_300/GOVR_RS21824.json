    "content": "During the debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Representative Souder highlighted the increasing number of drug and alcohol-related incidents on college campuses, calling it an epidemic. As a response, Congress added a provision to P.L. 105-244, eliminating financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug-related crimes. The legislation in P.L. 105-244 specifies that students convicted of drug-related crimes will lose eligibility for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. Ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple convictions. Students must complete a drug rehabilitation program to regain eligibility. Students can lose eligibility for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA if they have multiple drug-related convictions. The ineligibility period varies based on the offense, with indefinite ineligibility for certain convictions. To regain eligibility, students must complete a drug rehabilitation program or have the conviction removed from their record. According to the 2006-2007 Federal Student Aid Handbook, students can lose eligibility for federal student assistance if they have multiple drug-related convictions. The ineligibility period varies based on the offense, with indefinite ineligibility for certain convictions. To regain eligibility, students must complete a drug rehabilitation program. To regain eligibility for federal student assistance after multiple drug-related convictions, students must complete an eligible rehabilitation program as outlined in program regulations. The program must be funded or recognized by government entities or licensed entities, and include at least two unannounced drug tests. Participation in the program reduces the ineligibility period based on the number of convictions. Participation in a rehabilitation program reduces ineligibility for federal student assistance after multiple drug-related convictions. Completion of the program allows the student to self-certify completion and regain eligibility. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision. Since the adoption of the provision, over 180,000 students have been denied or delayed federal financial aid. California and Texas have seen a high number of students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision to disqualify students only for drug convictions while receiving Title IV aid. The amended provision specifies that only drug convictions while receiving Title IV aid disqualify students from federal financial aid. The period of ineligibility depends on the type of conviction, recency, and prior convictions. Legislative proposals aim to modify this provision in the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the HEA. During the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the HEA, legislative proposals are being considered to modify the existing drug conviction provision. Issues surrounding implementation, penalties, and who should be penalized are key points of discussion. Policymakers have expressed concerns about the increasing drug-related crimes on college campuses. During the 1998 reauthorization, policymakers expressed concerns about the rise in drug usage on college campuses and the corresponding increase in drug-related crimes. Congress included a provision for eligibility based on drug convictions, which critics argue unfairly singles out drugs. Supporters justify this focus by stating that drug-related crimes are more prevalent on college campuses compared to robbery, rape, and arson. The implications of limiting financial aid eligibility based on drug convictions may be considered during reauthorization. The provision for eligibility based on drug convictions on college campuses may be reconsidered during reauthorization. It does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony convictions, resulting in loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Congress may debate the distinction between selling and possession of controlled substances. The distinction between misdemeanor and felony drug convictions in relation to eligibility for student aid may be debated by Congress. Loss of eligibility is based on separate ineligibility periods and the number of convictions for selling versus possession of controlled substances."
