Attorneys' fees under the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA are based on prevailing community rates, with specific prohibitions and limitations. Fees cannot be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer under certain conditions, and no bonus or multiplier is allowed.

The Department of Education declined to award fees to non-attorney advocates at due process hearings, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA did not include explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees for prevailing parents."
