    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, but Supreme Court decisions have narrowed its protection. Congress recognized that disabilities should not hinder full participation in society. Congress recognized in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 that physical and mental impairments should not limit a person's right to participate fully in society. The Act was modeled after section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to address barriers faced by individuals with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was based on section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which had a broad definition of disability that included actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. This broad conception was supported by the Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, acknowledging society's myths and fears about disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to address society's myths and fears about disability, recognizing that adverse actions based on physical or mental impairments are often unrelated to the actual limitations caused by the impairment. However, the Supreme Court's ruling in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams in 2002 interpreted the definition of disability strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification. The Supreme Court ruling in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams in 2002 narrowed the definition of disability, creating a demanding standard for qualification. This contradicted the explicit congressional intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments through measures like medication and assistive devices. The Act aims to restore the broad scope of protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and address Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the class of people protected from discrimination. The Act aims to reinstate the original congressional intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying that protection is available for individuals subjected to adverse treatment based on impairment or prejudiced attitudes. The Act clarifies that individuals can be adversely affected by prejudiced attitudes or societal barriers related to disabilities, and it aims to protect them from such treatment. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aims to protect individuals from prejudiced attitudes or societal barriers related to disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. Individuals with disabilities have faced discrimination and unequal treatment throughout history. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to address discrimination against individuals with disabilities, emphasizing their history of unequal treatment and the need to disfavor classifications that exclude them without compelling reasons. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define disability as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having an impairment, without considering the use of mitigating measures. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines disability as a physical or mental impairment, without considering mitigating measures such as treatment or medication. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines disability as a physical or mental impairment, without considering mitigating measures such as treatment or medication. The term \"mitigating measure\" includes various treatments, medications, devices, and accommodations used to alleviate the effects of an impairment. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines disability as a physical or mental impairment, without considering mitigating measures. Mental impairment includes disorders like mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional illness, or learning disability. Physical impairment includes physiological disorders, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting various body systems. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines disability as a physical or mental impairment, without considering mitigating measures. It includes impairments affecting various body systems such as respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine. The Act also covers a \"record of a physical or mental impairment\" and being \"regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.\" SEC. 5. ADVERSE ACTION. An adverse action taken by an entity covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act against an individual due to their use of a mitigating measure or its side effects constitutes discrimination under this Act. SEC. 6 amends the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination based on disability. SEC. 7 defines a qualified individual, and SEC. 8 provides a rule of construction. Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of the Act for comprehensive prohibition of discrimination. Regulations must be issued within 180 days to implement various sections and carry out corresponding provisions. The Transportation Department will issue regulations to implement sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board will issue supplementary guidelines to supplement existing guidelines for accessible design. Design for titles II and III of this Act, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007, shall not limit the authority to issue regulations or guidelines under other provisions of this Act. Federal regulations and guidance for the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, including the definition of disability, shall be given deference in actions brought under this Act."
