    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress acknowledges the critical role of the FDA in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases, supported by regulatory innovation. A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is being developed to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, utilizing biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, and adaptive clinical trial designs. These advances call for the FDA to implement more effective processes for expedited review of innovative new medicines for unmet medical needs, including rare diseases, using modern scientific approaches. Innovative new medicines are being developed to address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases, utilizing modern scientific tools and endpoints. This may lead to expedited access to safe and effective therapies for patients without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval. The existing statutory authority governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions should be amended to enhance FDA's authority in considering scientific data and tools to expedite access to novel treatments. Congress supports applying accelerated approval and fast track provisions to help expedite drug development. The FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary can designate a new drug as a fast track product to expedite its development and review if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and shows potential to address unmet medical needs. The sponsor of the drug can request this designation at any time after submitting an application for investigation. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product to expedite development and review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease. The request for designation can be made after submitting an application for investigation. Within 60 days of the request, the Secretary will determine if the drug meets the criteria and if so, will take actions to expedite the approval process. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product to expedite development and review for serious or life-threatening diseases. The approval can be accelerated based on surrogate endpoints predicting clinical benefit. The FDA can approve a product based on surrogate or clinical endpoints that predict clinical benefit or other clinical outcomes. Evidence supporting these endpoints may include various scientific methods or tools. The FDA may approve a product based on evidence predicting clinical benefit, which can include epidemiological, pathophysiologic, pharmacologic, or therapeutic data using biomarkers or other scientific methods. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies and submission of promotional materials for review. The FDA may approve a product based on evidence predicting clinical benefit, which can include various data. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies and submission of promotional materials for review. The sponsor must submit promotional materials at least 30 days before dissemination during the preapproval review period and after approval. The Secretary can expedite withdrawal of approval if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently. The FDA may withdraw approval for a fast track product if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies diligently, if a study fails to verify predicted clinical benefits, if evidence shows the product is not safe or effective, or if false promotional materials are disseminated. The FDA may withdraw approval for a fast track product if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently, if clinical benefits are not verified, if the product is found to be unsafe or ineffective, or if false promotional materials are distributed. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track product approval if preliminary clinical data suggests effectiveness, with the applicant providing a schedule for completing the application and paying any required fees. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track product approval if preliminary clinical data suggests effectiveness, with the applicant providing necessary information and paying required fees. The Secretary will develop and disseminate information on accelerated approval and fast track products, and establish a program to encourage the development of scientific methods to predict clinical benefit for serious medical conditions with unmet needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment. Regulations governing accelerated approval will be amended to align with the amendments made by section 3. The Secretary must consider issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases, as well as novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence. The guidance may be necessary for diseases with low prevalence. The review or approval of requests or applications will not be delayed by the issuance of guidance or regulations. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW. The Secretary will contract an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with various stakeholders will be included. SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval, while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
