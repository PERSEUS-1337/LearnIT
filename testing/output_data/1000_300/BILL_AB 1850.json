    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the historical events of Japanese American exclusion, forced removal, and internment. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on 20 days of hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The CWRIC concluded that Executive Order 9066, which led to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, was not justified by military necessity. The decisions made were driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership, resulting in a grave personal injustice to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, declaring it a great day for America. Congress also declared their support for the act. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II, apologizing for the violations of their civil liberties and constitutional rights. The actions were motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria, resulting in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made. The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation for the fundamental violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights of individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II. The Legislature aims to establish a state test for eligible aliens to demonstrate their understanding of English, history, and government of the United States under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Legislature intends to create a state test for eligible undocumented foreign nationals to prove their English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Superintendent, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, will develop a test to measure the English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government for eligible foreign nationals, as required by federal law. The Governor, Superintendent, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, President pro Tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the Assembly will seek approval from the US Immigration and Naturalization Service and Attorney General to use a test for eligible foreign nationals to meet requirements under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Superintendent will distribute a test to educational agencies for eligible foreign nationals to demonstrate English proficiency and knowledge of US history and government for legal status purposes. Test results will be confidential. Eligible foreign nationals must demonstrate English proficiency and knowledge of US history and government for legal status. Test results are confidential and can only be released with written consent. Educational agencies receiving federal funds must administer the test with appropriate security measures. Section 52613 of the Education Code is amended regarding test administration for eligible foreign nationals seeking legal status. Section 52613 of the Education Code requires school districts offering classes for nonimmigrant foreign nationals to charge a fee to cover the full costs of instruction, with the fee not exceeding the actual cost. The fee must be adopted by the governing board at least 90 days before the classes begin. Section 52651 of the Education Code defines key terms for the chapter, including \"Board of Governors,\" \"Chancellor,\" \"Community-based organizations,\" \"Department,\" and \"Educational outreach activities.\" Educational outreach activities refer to providing information to temporary resident foreign nationals about the requirements of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act of 1986, including adjustment of resident status, sources of assistance, rights and responsibilities, health, employment, and social services. It excludes client counseling or assuming responsibility for the foreign national's application for resident status adjustment. The curr_chunk discusses educational opportunities for immigrants, defining \"immigrant\" and \"newly legalized person\" as per California law. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to educational services for immigrants, including \"Services provider,\" \"SLIAG,\" and \"Superintendent.\" It also amends Section 68062 of the Education Code regarding residency rules. The curr_chunk clarifies the definition of \"Superintendent\" as the Superintendent of Public Instruction and amends Section 68062 of the Education Code regarding residency rules, emphasizing that a residence can only be established by act and intent, and a woman's residence is not dependent on her husband's. A residence can only be changed by the union of act and intent. A woman's residence is not derived from her husband's. The residence of an unmarried minor is determined by the parent with whom they live. An unmarried minor's residence cannot be changed if a parent is living. An unmarried minor's residence cannot be changed by their own act, appointment of a legal guardian, or relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A foreign national, including an unmarried minor, can establish their residence unless prohibited by federal law. The residence of an unmarried minor foreign national is derived from their parents. Section 68130.5 of the Education Code is amended. An unmarried minor foreign national's residence is derived from their parents. Section 68130.5 of the Education Code is amended to exempt certain students from paying nonresident tuition at California State University and California Community Colleges. To qualify for exemption from nonresident tuition at California State University and California Community Colleges, students must meet specific criteria such as attending a California high school for three years, graduating from a California high school, enrolling in an accredited institution of higher education in California, and for individuals without lawful immigration status, filing an affidavit to legalize their immigration status. In cases of individuals without lawful immigration status, filing an affidavit with the institution of higher education stating the intent to legalize immigration status exempts students from nonresident tuition. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Trustees of the California State University will establish rules for implementation, and student information obtained is confidential. Student information obtained in the implementation of this section is confidential. Income received as reparation payments for Japanese ancestry interned during World War II shall not be considered in determining financial need. The Superintendent of Public Instruction must certify to the Secretary of State of California by January 20, 2017, that certain conditions related to the CHANGE Act have been met for Sections 3 to 8 of the act to become operative. This includes replacing the term \"alien\" with \"foreign national\" and \"illegal alien\" with \"undocumented foreign national\" in reference to individuals in the United States without lawful immigration status. The term \"illegal alien\" is replaced with \"undocumented foreign national\" for individuals without lawful immigration status in the United States. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction certifies this change, Section 2 of the act will become inoperative."
