    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and adds a new section 302 for findings and purposes. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Survey of the Coast, established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, evolved into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providing services related to surveying, mapping, charting, and water observations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides services related to hydrographic surveying, mapping, charting, and water observations to support marine transportation and economic prosperity. The increasing congestion in the marine transportation system and expected growth in international maritime commerce highlight the importance of maintaining federal expertise in hydrographic data and services. The Nation's marine transportation system is congested and international maritime commerce is expected to double in the next 20 years. Nearly half of the cargo in U.S. waters is hazardous substances. Hydrographic data and services support national needs for emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and coastal resiliency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a key role in establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, with a focus on coastal resiliency, ocean science advancement, and integrated ocean observing systems. The Director of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and represents the U.S. in the international hydrographic community. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides hydrographic expertise and data for boundary demarcation and jurisdiction, including the Exclusive Economic Zone. Research and development of new technologies aim to increase efficiency, competitiveness, and safety while reducing risks. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aims to enhance safety, provide economic benefits, and reduce risks through the Act by improving hydrographic data and services for various purposes including international trade, homeland security, and coastal resiliency. The Act aims to support homeland security, emergency response, ecosystem management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data for various applications such as storm surge monitoring, habitat restoration, and environmental assessments. It also promotes improved ocean and coastal mapping through increased coordination and cooperation. The Act aims to support homeland security, emergency response, ecosystem management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data for various applications such as storm surge monitoring, habitat restoration, and environmental assessments. It also promotes improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping, research and development in hydrographic data and services, and national and international leadership in hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying and measurement methods for providing hydrographic services, including bathymetric, geodetic, and geomagnetic data management and dissemination. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Act defines the functions and duties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, including the production of nautical charts and databases derived from hydrographic data. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and provide hydrographic services. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to include providing hydrographic services and maintaining operational expertise in hydrographic data acquisition. The Administrator is authorized to procure vessels, equipment, and technologies for safe navigation and operate real-time hydrographic monitoring systems. The Administrator is required to maintain expertise in hydrographic data acquisition and services, operate real-time monitoring systems for navigation safety, provide hydrographic data for coastal and ocean resource management, and support emergency response efforts to save lives and protect property. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to save lives, support commerce resumption in emergencies, disasters, and homeland security needs. They have authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and award contracts for data acquisition. The Administrator has the authority to award contracts for the acquisition of hydrographic data in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Changes were made to the quality assurance program and the hydrographic services review panel under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 was amended to change the composition of the panel, increasing the number of voting members to 15 and specifying qualifications related to hydrographic disciplines. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 was amended to increase the number of voting members on the panel to 15, with qualifications related to hydrographic disciplines. Voting members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in performing their duties. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 was amended to authorize $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for carrying out the Act."
