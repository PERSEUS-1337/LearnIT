    "title": "AB 575",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8 in subject areas like language arts, spelling, reading, and English language development. At least five materials must be adopted for each grade level in these subject areas. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for various subject areas, including Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Bilingual or bicultural subjects, and any other subject deemed necessary. Procedures for submission of instructional materials must be established to comply with these requirements. The state board must adopt procedures for submitting instructional materials for various subject areas once or twice every eight years. Curriculum frameworks must be reviewed and adopted for each subject area, with consistent criteria for evaluating materials. Resubmitted materials that were previously rejected must have substantive changes to be considered. If revisions to instructional material are submitted late, a fee will be assessed by the department. Materials must be adopted or rejected within six months, with a possible extension of three months if needed. The process for reviewing instructional materials involves committees with volunteer experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. Rules for adopting materials must be transparent and consistent, regardless of format. Criteria for adoption include ensuring materials meet specific standards set by the state board. The state board reviews and adopts basic instructional materials based on specific criteria to ensure alignment with curriculum frameworks, compliance with state guidelines, accuracy, and alignment with content standards. Instructional materials must be factually accurate, aligned with state content standards, and free from unnecessary commercial branding unless deemed necessary for educational purposes by the state board. The use of commercial brand names, products, or logos in instructional materials must be necessary for educational purposes or incidental to illustrations. Criteria for approval must align with state guidelines and frameworks. The state board may provide a written explanation for rejecting instructional materials based on established criteria. They may adopt fewer than five materials if less than five are submitted. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if less than five are submitted or if the materials do not meet the criteria. This does not limit the board's authority to adopt other materials. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if less than five are submitted or if the materials do not meet the criteria. This does not limit the board's authority to adopt other materials. Additionally, the state board shall prescribe procedures to provide an open and flexible materials submission system that caters to diverse pupil populations and includes instructional materials representing cultural pluralism and a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and makes them available to publishers, manufacturers, and school interests. The materials remain on the list for procurement until a new curriculum framework is adopted. Lists are categorized by subject and grade level, posted on the department's website, and include information from review committees. The state board adopts instructional materials categorized by subject and grade level, posted on the department's website. Information from review committees is included, with guidelines on publisher logos and copyright protection. The state board may adopt regulations for exceptions, and the Superintendent will develop guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code defines followup adoptions and requires notice before conducting them in a subject area. Before conducting a followup adoption in a subject area, the department must post a notice on their website and notify publishers. Publishers participating will be assessed a fee based on the number of programs and grade levels submitted for review to cover the adoption process costs. The department aims to keep the fee modest by minimizing duplication of work from the primary adoption process. Before incurring substantial costs for the followup adoption, the department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit specific programs for review, specifying grade levels. A fee is assessed, payable even if programs are withdrawn or grade levels reduced. Submission will not be reviewed until the fee is paid in full. The Legislature intends for the fee for follow-up adoption not to be a barrier for small publishers or manufacturers to participate. Small publishers or manufacturers can request a fee reduction. Small publishers and manufacturers are defined as independently owned or operated businesses with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less. Revenue from fees will be used for adoption and review of instructional materials. The revenue from fees charged for follow-up adoptions will be used for adoption and instructional material review costs. If there is little interest from publishers, the follow-up adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, unless extended or repealed by a later statute."
