    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the Truth in Employment Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The practice of \"salting\" by union organizers has evolved into aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of rights in collective bargaining. Organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm to competitors. The practice of \"salting\" by union organizers involves seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or harm competitors. Employers should expect job applicants to be interested in furthering the goals of the business. The purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire individuals who seek to disrupt the workplace. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. Amends Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who are not genuine job applicants. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants to organize, form labor unions, or engage in collective bargaining. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to determine single location bargaining unit appropriateness. A blanket rule limiting factors considered in determining appropriateness detracts from promoting stability in labor relations.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit. Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include provisions for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. Factors to be considered include functional integration, centralized control, common skills, working conditions, employee interchange, geographical separation, local autonomy, number of employees, and bargaining history. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field for these entities. Due to the Board's greater resources, certain small entities should be awarded fees and costs when they prevail against the Board. The purpose of this title is to address these disparities. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to expenses. It aims to reduce the resource and expertise gap between small entities and the Board, holding the Board more accountable by awarding fees and costs to certain small entities when they prevail. The purpose of this title is to make the National Labor Relations Board more accountable for its enforcement actions against small businesses and labor organizations by awarding fees and costs to these entities when they prevail. SEC. 302 amends the National Labor Relations Act by adding a new section regarding awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 outlines the conditions under which an employer or labor organization can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in administrative and court proceedings conducted by the Board under various Acts. The criteria include being the prevailing party, having a small workforce and net worth, and meeting the definition of an adversary adjudication. An employer or labor organization meeting specific criteria can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in court proceedings by the Board, regardless of the justification of the United States' position. Section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code allows for the award of fees and expenses to a prevailing party in court proceedings, without considering the justification of the United States' position. Any appeal of fee determinations will also not consider the justification of the United States' position. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act applies to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of this Act."
