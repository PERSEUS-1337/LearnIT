    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act aims to increase awareness and education about cord blood. Congress acknowledges the high mortality rates caused by leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, particularly among children and young adults. Many leukemia patients require bone marrow transplants but struggle to find a suitable match. Umbilical cord blood stem cells are highlighted as a potential solution in this Act. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in treating various blood diseases, with a 1 in 4 chance of a newborn's cord blood cells being a perfect match for a sibling. Cord blood cells have been utilized in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, offering a rich source of stem cells for transplantation with lower rates of complications compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have a lower rate of graft versus host disease than bone marrow and are easier to match based on HLA typing. They have been used to effectively treat various blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain different types of stem cells that can differentiate into every cell type in the human body, decrease inflammation, and stimulate tissue repair. Clinical research and experimental use continue to explore their potential. Cord blood cells are pluripotent, able to differentiate into any cell type in the body. Research is ongoing for using these cells to treat various conditions like type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and hearing loss. Despite their potential, over 90% of cord blood cells are discarded as medical waste in the US. Less than a quarter of states require parents to be informed about the option to bank their baby's cord blood. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended that expectant parents be provided with clear information about their options to bank their baby's cord blood in public or private blood banks. They also suggested that informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery for the collection, storage, and use of cord blood cells. The Institute of Medicine recommended clear information on banking cord blood cells and obtaining informed consent before labor and delivery. SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop and publish a public information resource on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will cover the value and uses of cord blood, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, and distinctions between public and private cord blood banking. The differences between using one's own cord blood cells (autologous) and related or unrelated cord blood stem cells (allogeneic use) in disease treatment, public vs private umbilical cord blood banking, and options for mothers regarding umbilical cord blood stem cells after delivery. The curr_chunk discusses the options for umbilical cord blood banking, including storing for family members, discarding, medical processes involved, criteria for consideration, ownership options, and cost. Options for ownership and future use of donated umbilical cord blood, average cost of public and private cord blood banking, availability of public and private cord blood banks, including lists of accredited private banks and public banks in the US, and information on free family banking and sibling donor programs for those with medical needs. Explanation of which racial and ethnic groups are in particular need of publicly donated cord blood samples. Explanation of racial and ethnic groups in need of publicly donated cord blood samples based on medical data. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document regarding cord blood disposition, to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. Certain professionals must disclose information and obtain consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must inform pregnant women about umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells must be obtained before the woman's estimated delivery date. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals must inform pregnant women about cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent for cord blood stem cell disposition must be obtained before the estimated delivery date. Medicaid regulations will be amended to ensure healthcare professionals comply with these requirements. The new amendment requires healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with specific requirements and includes a method for enforcement. If a State fails to comply, the Secretary may reduce payments made to the State under Medicaid regulations. The amendment mandates healthcare providers offering prenatal care to pregnant women to meet certain requirements, with enforcement measures in place. Non-compliance by a State may result in reduced Medicaid payments. The amendment requires group health plans to inform pregnant women about blood cord banking as part of prenatal care benefits. The amendment mandates that pregnant women receiving ambulatory prenatal care must ensure their physician complies with the requirements of the section. This applies to agreements and arrangements entered into by physicians and other healthcare professionals. The amendments made by this subsection apply to physicians and other healthcare professionals for agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may provide grants for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells to healthcare providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
