Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then restricted from accessing various disability benefits and often struggle to find employment due to the label on their discharge paperwork. The Department of Defense's compliance in separating members based on these disorders has been questioned by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office found that Department of Defense compliance in separating veterans based on personality or adjustment disorders was as low as 40% between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is needed to ensure wrongly separated veterans can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense is reviewing military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense is amending Chapter 79 of title 10, United States Code to establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members appointed by the Secretary of Defense, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist.

The Secretary of Defense ensures that covered individuals are notified of their right to a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review for separations from the armed forces due to mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Secretary of the military department is responsible for providing this notification and must comply with the requirement. The Secretary of Defense ensures covered individuals are notified of their right to request a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review for separations from the armed forces due to mental conditions.

The notification must inform the individual of their right to obtain legal counsel for representation before the Board. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review shall inform covered individuals of their right to obtain legal counsel and review the findings and decisions related to their separation from the armed forces due to mental conditions.

The board will consider all evidence, including private mental health records submitted by the individual. If the board decides to conduct a review, the individual will be notified. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will notify the covered individual or their representative before conducting a review.

The individual can request reconsideration with new evidence. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend recharacterizing the separation of a covered individual to retirement for disability, separation for disability with severance pay, separation upon expiration of service term, or separation for convenience of the Government, as well as issuing a new disability rating. If retirement for disability is not recommended, a brief statement must be included. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review must provide a brief statement if they do not recommend recharacterizing the separation of a covered individual to retirement for disability. The Secretary of the military department concerned will correct the military records of the individual based on the Board's recommendation, effective as of the separation date. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review corrects military records for covered individuals, with adjustments for previous back pay.
