    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. It discusses how advancements in addressing malaria can improve maternal and child survival. UNICEF reported a 60% drop in under-five mortality since 1960, but daily deaths among children under five remain high at 26,000. Despite a 60% drop in under-five mortality since 1960, an estimated 9.7 million children in that age range still die, with 26,000 daily deaths. Most child deaths occur in developing countries, especially in Africa, with neonatal infections and five infectious diseases being the main causes. Undernutrition is a significant factor in up to half of these deaths. According to UNICEF, undernutrition is a major factor in child mortality, with acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, measles, and HIV/AIDS also contributing to deaths. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions, with Millennium Development Goals aiming for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Progress in other MDGs, such as access to clean water, can impact the ability to reach these goals. Maternal and child mortality rates are affected by progress in other Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), such as undernourishment, lack of clean water, and susceptibility to infectious diseases. UNICEF reports that many countries, especially in Africa, are not making progress towards child survival goals. Over 500,000 women die annually from pregnancy-related causes, with the majority in developing countries. More than 500,000 women die each year due to pregnancy-related causes in developing countries, where maternal mortality rates are significantly higher. The United Nations emphasizes the importance of access to adequate diets, safe water, literacy, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth to prevent these deaths. Undernutrition is linked to 20% of maternal deaths, while obstetric complications account for about 75% of maternal deaths. Maternal deaths are often caused by undernutrition (20%) and obstetric complications (75%), including hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia, prolonged labor, and unsafe abortions. Young mothers under 20 face higher risks of complications like toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, and delivering low birth weight babies. Adolescents aged 15-19 have the highest pregnancy-related death rates globally, with 15 million giving birth annually. Girls under 15 are five times more likely to die from childbirth than women in their twenties. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year, with girls aged 15-19 being at higher risk of maternal mortality. Maternal death causes vary by region, with hemorrhage being a significant factor in Africa and Asia. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In Latin America and the Caribbean, hemorrhage contributes to 13% and 21% of maternal deaths, respectively. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 65% in south Asia and 99% in industrialized nations. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. Many countries lack the capacity to reduce mortality nationwide, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum health workforce standard. Child and maternal survival rates are higher in areas with sufficient health workers, clean water, controlled mosquito populations, and access to nutritious food. Southeast Asia faces the greatest absolute shortage of health workers, while sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest proportional shortage. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health care workers, with 36 in Africa. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed globally, and countries in Africa would need to increase their health workers by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold. The U.S. Agency for International Development is leading efforts to improve child survival worldwide through research and interventions. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) leads global child survival efforts, committing over $6 billion in the past 20 years. USAID focuses on addressing six major health issues that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocates a significant portion of its child survival funds to address neonatal complications and undernutrition, which contribute to 90% of child deaths in developing countries. Studies show that children who are underweight are at a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, with malnutrition weakening their immune systems. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that hunger and malnutrition are major factors in the deaths of nearly 10 million children annually. Children who are underweight face a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, with malnutrition weakening their immune systems. Studies show that mildly underweight children are twice as likely to die from infectious diseases, while moderately to severely underweight children face a risk five to eight times higher. Malnourished children have a higher likelihood of death from diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition impairs the immune system, making children more susceptible to illnesses like diarrhea, pneumonia, and measles. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation, fortification, and infant and young child feeding. Children are more susceptible to infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, including adding zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. Research on biofortified crops is also funded, aiming to enhance the nutrient content of basic foods. These programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation to combat malnutrition-related deaths in infants and children. Micronutrient supplementation and other USAID nutrition programs are integrated with interventions like safe water, hygiene, and sanitation to combat malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. USAID emphasizes the importance of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life, as early cessation and improper food introduction can expose infants to diseases. Exclusively breastfed infants have lower rates of childhood diseases and are less likely to die from respiratory or diarrheal diseases. The study found that exclusively breastfed infants have significantly lower rates of childhood diseases and are less likely to die from respiratory or diarrheal diseases. USAID and UNICEF emphasize the importance of breastfeeding and micronutrient supplementation to prevent infant and child deaths. In communities affected by HIV/AIDS, USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices with programs to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. USAID spends about $30 million annually on nutrition programs, including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF recommends minimizing indoor pollution, ensuring adequate nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and providing Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. UNICEF emphasizes prevention of pneumonia through minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements. Immunizations against infections like Hib and pertussis are crucial. USAID supports vaccination programs and treatment for child pneumonia, with over 375 million cases treated since 2002. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) was developed in the mid-1990s to address childhood illnesses with USAID support. USAID, in collaboration with UNICEF and WHO, has been actively involved in the administration of immunizations to millions of children and the treatment of child pneumonia cases. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, supported by USAID, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. Malaria remains a significant concern, with approximately 40% of the world's population at risk. USAID has expanded efforts in malaria eradication, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the disease is particularly deadly for children. In 2005, the President proposed the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the CDC, aiming to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in those countries by 2010. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed in 2005 to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs. USAID reported reaching over 25 million people within two years, with activities including indoor residual spraying, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) has distributed 12.6 million malarial treatments, trained 28,000 health workers, and purchased 4 million anti-malarial tablets. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, with successful interventions reducing mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose, is widely used for mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention. The cost of preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission with Nevirapine is between $0.29 and $0.40 per dose. Early diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for children, with ART costing about $260 per child annually compared to $183 for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments combining multiple drugs in a single pill are most effective but more expensive for children. In 2005, a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen for an adult costs an average of $148 in low-income countries, but for children, it cost $2,000 per child and $800 for a generic version. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs at $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Cotrimoxazole, used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Since 1986, USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries. Cotrimoxazole, a drug that treats pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children who need the drug are receiving it. Through PEPFAR, USAID has provided over $289.2 million to initiatives supporting 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, with food and nutrition programs reaching 332,000 OVC. PEPFAR implementing agencies have provided $289.2 million to initiatives supporting 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. Food and nutrition programs reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely malnourished individuals on ART. Child-focus programs support training, promote technologies, income-generating activities, and connect families to essential health care. Support for people living with HIV/AIDS receiving treatment should also be considered when analyzing support for children. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS care and support services. Pediatric treatment received $191.5 million in funding, with PMTCT services preventing 157,000 infant HIV infections. Diarrhea prevention and treatment methods were identified by UNICEF, WHO, and USAID. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for the treatment of child diarrhea, preventing nearly 5 billion episodes with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS). Their programs focus on training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and improving hygiene to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children by 42% to 46%. USAID focuses on expanding community capacity to administer ORS and promoting hygiene to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children. Handwashing with soap can decrease diarrhea prevalence by 42% to 46%, but it is not common in poorer communities. Public-private partnerships supported by USAID promote handwashing with soap and other hygienic practices to reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. USAID supports public-private partnerships to promote handwashing with soap and other hygienic practices, reducing diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. Measles immunization is cost-effective, saving more lives per unit cost than any other health intervention, with the vaccine costing less than $1 per dose. The measles vaccine, when bought through UNICEF, costs about $0.65 per bundled dose for MR and $1.04 to $1.50 for MMR. Immunization coverage rates for measles vaccination have increased to about 80% of all children in 2006, up from 72% in 2000. Accelerated activities have led to a significant reduction in global measles cases. Between 2000 and 2006, global measles mortality decreased by 68%, with the largest gains in Africa where cases and deaths fell by 91%. USAID supports immunization programs in over 100 countries, partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen vaccination efforts. USAID partners with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen vaccination efforts in over 100 countries. Their maternal health programs aim to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes through various interventions, including nutritional supplementation, immunizations, and treatment for diseases like malaria and syphilis. They advocate for skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries. USAID partners with organizations to strengthen vaccination efforts in over 100 countries, focusing on maternal health programs for healthy pregnancy outcomes. They advocate for skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries, training birth attendants to prevent infant deaths and address key causes of maternal mortality. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by focusing on preventing postpartum hemorrhage, which accounts for 32% of maternal deaths. They train birth attendants to manage the third stage of labor, using interventions like controlled traction of the umbilical cord and oxytocin to prevent and treat hemorrhages, potentially saving 60% of cases. USAID supports programs to train birth attendants in actively managing the third stage of labor, which includes controlled traction of the umbilical cord, uterine massage, and the use of oxytocin to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. This intervention can prevent 60% of hemorrhages. Unhygienic delivery practices, such as using unclean hands or instruments, contribute to sepsis, which causes nearly 10% of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. USAID supports efforts to distribute delivery kits and ensure the presence of trained delivery attendants to prevent maternal and infant mortality. Conditions, untrained delivery attendants, and hypertensive disorders contribute to sepsis and maternal deaths. USAID supports distributing delivery kits and training birth attendants to prevent infections. They also train healthcare providers to recognize and treat pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Prolonged or obstructed labor can occur due to various reasons. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to complications like obstetric fistula, especially in low-resource settings. Young girls and undernourished women are at higher risk. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases were among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy can help prevent obstetric fistula. In low-resource settings, young girls and undernourished women are at higher risk of developing obstetric fistula due to their underdeveloped pelvic regions. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and timely caesarean surgeries can prevent obstetric fistula. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005 respectively, integrating them with other maternal health programs to increase access to emergency obstetrical care and promote the postponement of child marriage and sexual debut. Training families and community health practitioners to identify signs of prolonged or obstructed labor is also a key activity in preventing obstetric fistula. Key activities to prevent maternal death and disability include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, postponing child marriage and sexual debut, training families and health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. USAID's family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths in the last 20 years. USAID's international family planning programs have helped prevent maternal deaths from unsafe abortions, with about 4% of women in Africa dying after attempting one. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, grew significantly from FY2001 to FY2003, with strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. From FY2004 through FY2008, U.S. support for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs increased significantly, with a focus on the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Some Members questioned the Administration's allocation of funds, particularly for child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health interventions. Recipient countries' ability to absorb the growing HIV/AIDS funds was also a point of contention. Congress provided significantly more funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs compared to other global health interventions such as child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health. There were concerns about recipient countries' capacity to absorb the increasing HIV/AIDS funds due to strained health infrastructures. Congress urged better integration of HIV/AIDS with other health programs like TB and nutrition. Appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria far exceeded support for USAID's other health initiatives during FY2004 through FY2008. Congress consistently increased funding for specific disease-focused global health programs under President George W. Bush, such as the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, PEPFAR, and the President's Malaria Initiative. However, appropriations for other health issues like child survival and maternal health remained relatively unchanged, except for a slight increase in FY2008. Many health experts are concerned that while funding for disease-focused global health programs like HIV/AIDS has increased, other critical health issues such as child survival and maternal health have been overlooked and underfunded, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization states that two-thirds of child deaths are preventable through low-cost interventions, emphasizing the need for increased support for these programs. Some argue for increased funding for comprehensive maternal and child health programs, including voluntary family planning to improve health outcomes. USAID highlights the benefits of family planning in reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, and protecting the environment. However, concerns exist about potential abuses in family planning programs. Family planning can improve health outcomes by reducing high-risk pregnancies and preventing HIV/AIDS. It can also help stabilize population growth and protect the environment. Concerns exist about potential abuses in family planning programs, including abortions and coercive practices. Adolescent girls are at higher risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, with those under 20 years old more likely to deliver low-birthweight babies and experience complications such as toxemia and prolonged labor. Girls between 15 and 19 years old are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties. Young girls between 15 and 19 years old are at higher risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, with a higher likelihood of developing obstetric fistula. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases are among adolescents. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed and performing caesarean surgery when needed can prevent obstetric fistula. Repairing the condition costs about $300, which is prohibitive for many young girls and women in affected countries. Increasing spending on health systems is advocated to reduce maternal and child mortality effectively. To reduce maternal and child mortality, governments need to implement various health strategies, including improving income and food levels, maternal health status, access to vaccinations and health services, safe water, and sanitation. Strengthening health systems and having enough health workers are crucial for these improvements. Without donor support, many countries' health systems struggle to provide essential interventions like vaccinations effectively. Advocates suggest better coordination of health assistance by USAID with other donors and health ministries to enhance efficiency and health outcomes. Advocates urge Congress to direct USAID to coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries to improve efficiency and outcomes. They point to the WHO's International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+), which encourages donors to create compacts with countries for long-term financing and mutual accountability. Country compacts bind all donors and government agencies. Country compacts are contracts between the international community and recipient countries for long-term financing and mutual accountability in health. They involve one health plan, monitoring and evaluation plan, budget, reporting process, and benchmarks for government performance. Critics highlight the importance of political will in ensuring adequate health spending in developing countries. According to the IMF, lack of political will is cited as a key reason for unspent health funds by 29% of health practitioners surveyed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports that lack of political will is a major factor in minimal health spending by many developing countries. Health practitioners cite this as a key reason for unspent health funds, with only 1% blaming IMF or World Bank restrictions. African countries with severe health worker shortages spend an average of $33 per person on health annually, compared to the U.S. government's $2,548 per capita spending. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the Abuja Declaration committing to at least 15% of national budgets allocated to health. In April 2001, African Union (AU) and Organization of African Unity (OAU) members signed the Abuja Declaration to allocate 15% of national budgets to health care. By 2004, only Botswana met this target, with 33% of AU states allocating 10% or more to health. Critics argue that poor political will is not the main reason for low health spending in Africa. Some African governments struggle to allocate sufficient funds to healthcare, with only Botswana meeting the recommended 15% budget allocation. Critics blame structural adjustment programs and lending practices for limiting investments in public health and health worker education, leading to shortages in supplies, medicine, and a brain drain of health workers. Discussions on the impact of these factors on public health are often biased. The International Development Research Center criticizes biased discussions on the impact of structural adjustment and lending practices on public health. Results are mixed, and the organization does not support extreme views. Bills in the 110th Congress aim to improve maternal and child health, including increased funding by $5 million in FY2008. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aim to improve maternal and child health, including increased funding for maternal and child health by $5 million in FY2008. H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorize significant funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with a focus on providing maternal and child services to women receiving drugs to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. The House version of the bill passed with a vote of 308-116, emphasizing linkages to NGOs for HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs. The Senate version, passed by voice vote 80-16, includes a substitute amendment for global poverty reduction efforts. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to promote global poverty reduction and improve maternal and child health in developing countries. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to promote global poverty reduction and improve maternal and child health in developing countries. The bills aim to provide assistance for newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries through various programs and contributions to the United Nations Population Fund. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to support global poverty reduction and improve maternal and child health in developing countries. H.R. 2604 and S. 1998 provide financial support to the United Nations Population Fund for women's health and dignity, while S. 2682 directs U.S. funding for maternal and child health purposes. The bill S. 2682 directs U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund for maternal and child health purposes. H.Res. 1045 calls for reducing nuclear weapons and reallocating savings towards child survival, hunger, and education. The resolution H.Res. 1022 affirms the House's commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment. It directs savings from nuclear disarmament towards these goals and calls on the President to take action. The resolution was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee."
