    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that type 2 diabetes affects 17 million Americans, with over 1 million new cases diagnosed annually, costing the nation an estimated $138 billion per year. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common complication of diabetes, leads to visual degradation and blindness, affecting individuals aged 20 to 74. Most diabetics will develop diabetic retinopathy, with the risk increasing with diabetes duration. Early detection through clinical trials has been shown to be beneficial. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is increasing due to the onset of type 2 diabetes at younger ages. Clinical trials have shown that early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%. Remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy can help reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas without access to in-office eye examinations. Medicare coverage is expanded to include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, allowing for early detection and treatment in underserved areas. Medicare now covers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, enabling early detection through annual diagnostic examinations provided via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies, regardless of the location of the healthcare provider. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy through store-and-forward technologies, with interim payment provided until final regulations are published. Additionally, a study on reimbursement for these assessments will be conducted within a year of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the costs incurred by health care providers for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report with recommendations on Medicare reimbursement adequacy and the need for repeating the study will be submitted to Congress within two years of the Act's enactment. The amendments made by subsection (a) regarding reimbursements for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy under Medicare will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the enactment of the Act. The study on reimbursement adequacy and the need for repeating it will be submitted to Congress within two years. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act specifying the effective date and state compliance requirements. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments to the Social Security Act. Failure to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session will not be considered non-compliance with the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is treated as a separate regular session. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to provide grants to 5 eligible entities for setting up mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants cannot exceed $1,000,000 per year, and entities must use the funds for designing, demonstrating, and implementing the screening program. Applications must be submitted within 90 days of funds becoming available. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment when awarding grants exceeding $1,000,000 per year under this section. Application details will be specified in a notice published 90 days after funds are available. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment for grants under this section, giving priority to rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. Congressional notification is required before making grants, and an evaluation report must be conducted within 3 years of the first grant. The Secretary will convene an advisory committee to evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program, assessing its effectiveness in early detection and prevention of diabetic retinopathy. The committee will determine if the program warrants continued support and if it can be beneficial for other populations. The Secretary will convene an advisory committee to evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy and its potential as a model for other screening programs. The committee will assess the program's impact on complications related to diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other chronic conditions. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as advisory committee, eligible entity, and mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program. An advisory committee is convened to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program in detecting diabetic retinopathy. Eligible entities include hospitals, states, institutions of higher education, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, and community health centers receiving assistance under section 330. The term 'mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program' refers to a program that offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, primarily serving patients in rural, underserved, and remote areas, and is determined to be mobile by the Secretary. The Program specifically refers to the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program established under this section. Authorization of appropriations is set at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 for the implementation of this program. Authorized appropriations of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2005-2009 for the mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program, with additional funding for evaluation and reporting."
