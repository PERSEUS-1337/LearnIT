The Act establishes the District of Columbia Natural Disaster Protection Funds, allowing qualified contributions to a natural disaster protection fund to be deductible. Additionally, a special rule is introduced for assets held in the fund for determining gross income. The Act introduces a special rule for assets held in a natural disaster protection fund, excluding income, gain, loss, or deduction from gross income calculations. Additionally, distributions from the fund are subject to specific rules under section 832(b) of the Code. The new subsection (h) in Section 832 of the Code defines and provides rules for natural disaster protection funds, including the exclusion of certain distributions from gross income if returned prior to filing the tax return. The new subsection (h) in Section 832 of the Code defines a natural disaster protection fund as money, securities, or property held by a qualified insurance company in a segregated account designated for natural disaster protection. The new subsection (h) in Section 832 of the Code defines a natural disaster protection fund as assets required to be invested in a manner consistent with investment laws, with excess balance drawdown amounts distributed to the qualified insurance company by the close of the following taxable year. The new subsection (h) in Section 832 of the Code defines a natural disaster protection fund as assets required to be invested in a manner consistent with investment laws. The qualified insurance company must receive excess balance drawdown amounts by the close of the following taxable year. A qualified insurance company is an insurer or reinsurer incorporated and domiciled in the District of Columbia, subject to supervision by the District of Columbia Commissioner of Insurance, Securities, and Banking, and maintains an office in the District of Columbia with at least 10 full-time employees. The new subsection (h) in Section 832 of the Code defines a natural disaster protection fund as assets required to be invested in a manner consistent with investment laws. A qualified insurance company in the District of Columbia must meet specific criteria, including maintaining an office with at least 10 full-time employees, being subject to various taxes and fees, and complying with additional taxes on natural catastrophic risk coverage premiums. The District of Columbia imposes rates on premiums for natural catastrophic risk coverage through a fund, not exceeding the federal excise tax rate on reinsurance contracts. A qualified contribution is a contribution to a fund by a qualified insurance company, limited to the net total. A qualified contribution is a contribution to a fund established by a qualified insurance company, limited to the total of net premiums received for coverage of qualified losses. The contribution must not exceed the amount reasonably at risk for the payment of qualified losses insured through the fund, less reinsurance on those risks, as determined actuarially on a multi-year basis. The term 'qualified distribution' refers to payments made for qualified losses under insurance or reinsurance contracts, spreading catastrophe risk, excess balance drawdown, fund maintenance expenses, and claims investigation related to qualified losses. The term 'qualified loss' refers to insured losses on a United States risk caused by events such as wind, earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption, or fire. The text chunk discusses various catastrophic events such as earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption, fire, hail, snow, ice, pandemic, and public health catastrophe that can lead to insured losses. The insured loss must meet certain criteria to be considered a catastrophe designation. The text discusses criteria for a catastrophic event to be considered a catastrophe designation, including exceeding $1 billion in insured losses, a declaration of disaster by the President, or a state of emergency declared by a Governor or chief executive. The term 'excess balance drawdown amount' refers to the surplus of the fund balance over the total exposure to qualified losses under contracts issued by a qualified insurance company. The term 'United States risk' refers to hazards, risks, losses, or liabilities related to property or activities in the United States or its territories. Premiums and losses from risks covered by a catastrophe reserve in Puerto Rico are excluded from consideration in determining the excess balance drawdown amount. Contributions and losses related to risks covered by a catastrophe reserve in Puerto Rico are not considered in determining qualified contributions or losses. Transfers of property to a fund are treated as sales or exchanges at fair market value, with adjustments to the property's basis. Distributions of property from a fund to an insurance company are also treated as sales or exchanges. Distributions of property from a fund to a qualified insurance company are treated as sales or exchanges, with any gain or loss excluded from the gross income of the insurance company. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this subsection. Additionally, there is an additional tax on certain nonqualified distributions from a natural disaster protection fund. The tax on insurance companies is amended to include a 20% increase for nonqualified distributions from a natural disaster protection fund. Nonqualified distributions are defined as any distribution other than a qualified distribution. The bill defines nonqualified distributions as any distribution from a natural disaster protection fund that is not a qualified distribution. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
