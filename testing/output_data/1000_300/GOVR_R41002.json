    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs and changes the benefits produced by a dam. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a significant role. The federal government has a limited role in municipal and industrial water supply development, with states and local entities playing a significant role as recognized in the Water Supply Act of 1958. Federal investments in water resources infrastructure primarily support cooperation with states and local interests in developing water supplies. The federal government primarily invests in water resources infrastructure for flood control, navigation, irrigation, multipurpose dams, and diversion facilities. Construction of large federal dams has slowed since the 1960s due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. The Corps is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water resources infrastructure, focusing on operating existing reservoirs and managing for new objectives. Each project has specific purposes outlined in authorizing language and subsequent legislation. The Corps is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water resources infrastructure with specific purposes outlined in authorizing language and subsequent legislation. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose, with additional requirements for all facilities such as fish and wildlife protection and recreation benefits. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and Section 6 of the Flood Control Act of 1944. The Corps has limited authority under the 1958 WSA and Section 6 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 to provide M&I water supply. The focus is on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoirs with storage reallocated under this authority. The 1944 authority allows temporary provision of surplus water for M&I use but is not likely to play a significant role in permanent reallocation of water. The 1958 Water Supply Act limited the Corps' authority to provide M&I water supply without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply purposes require Congress' approval. The 1958 Water Supply Act limits the Corps' authority to provide M&I water supply without congressional approval. Reallocation of water supply for authorized purposes requires congressional authorization, with guidelines outlined in the Corps' manual. In March 1977, the Corps established criteria for reallocations of reservoir storage for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply purposes without congressional approval. The criteria state that reallocations are insignificant if they do not exceed 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet. This guidance followed a federal court decision regarding Corps operations at Lake Lanier, Georgia. The Corps' discretionary authority and reservoir storage reallocations have come under scrutiny after a federal court decision regarding operations at Lake Lanier. Lawsuits were consolidated in 2007, with a 2009 court order finding the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes to provide water supply. Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers argued that congressional approval was necessary due to major operational changes. The court order sided with Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers, stating that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval since the mid-1970s. This reallocation, totaling roughly 260,000 acre-feet, began with operational changes shifting storage from hydropower to municipal and industrial (M&I) supply. The court found that the Corps exceeded its authority by allowing M&I water providers to withdraw directly from the lake, impacting M&I water supply for communities. The Corps contracted with M&I water providers for storage space from the lake, but the court found that their actions exceeded their authority. Questions have been raised about water reallocation at other Corps facilities, with 135 reservoirs having M&I water storage. Some reservoirs derive storage authority from the 1958 WSA, totaling less than 640,000 AF. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF for M&I use at Lake Texoma, using discretionary authority. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, with specific congressional approval and compensation arrangements negotiated among stakeholders. The reallocation did not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes and did not require significant structural modifications, allowing it to be performed under the 1958 WSA. The Corps found that reallocation at Cowanesque Lake could be done under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval, despite exceeding the 50,000 AF limit. The reallocation represented almost 30% of storage at Cowanesque Lake, a mix of project-specific direction from Congress and Corps' discretionary authority. The Cowanesque reallocation under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority was mentioned in P.L. 99-88 and discussed in H.Rept. 99-236. The 1958 WSA states that reallocation should not seriously affect authorized purposes or result in major operational changes. Concerns were raised about whether studies evaluating M&I reallocation effects on authorized purposes were sufficient, as seen in the 2009 court order questioning Corps evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations. The 2009 court order raised concerns about the Corps' evaluations of M&I reallocation effects on authorized purposes, particularly regarding Lake Lanier operations. Unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at various Corps facilities remain largely unknown due to the age and incremental evolution of many dams. The 2009 court order raised concerns about the Corps' evaluations of M&I reallocation effects on authorized purposes, particularly regarding Lake Lanier operations. Many Corps dams are old, and unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other facilities are largely unknown. The controversy surrounding the Corps' provision of M&I water supply at Lake Lanier has led to uncertainty about future reallocations at Corps facilities. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation, either through delegated authority or congressional direction. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA have generally met the Corps' criteria, but questions remain about the agency's discretionary authority in M&I reallocation. Issues include how multiple reallocations in a basin are handled, the agency's discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized withdrawals. The current policies on M&I reallocations at Corps facilities involve decisions on how to handle reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, unauthorized withdrawals, transition processes for reallocations, charging for M&I storage space, and crediting for return flows. These decisions may need reexamination as more reallocations are requested, posing broader water policy questions for Congress. The federal government faces questions regarding the appropriate role in municipal water supply, especially in light of potential climate change effects like extended drought. Current water resource infrastructure operations and laws are being scrutinized for their alignment with national interests and challenges. The complexity of addressing these questions is compounded by differing opinions and the difficulty of enacting significant changes to federal facilities due to various stakeholders involved."
