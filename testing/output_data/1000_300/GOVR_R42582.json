Despite progress, foreign aid continues to play a role in advancing U.S. policy in the region. Foreign aid plays a crucial role in advancing U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress oversees aid programs and examines budget priorities, with potential cuts in foreign assistance due to budget constraints. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may lead to reduced aid budgets in the future. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may lead to reduced aid budgets in the future, placing greater scrutiny on the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. aid programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to the region, including historical trends, the Obama Administration's FY2013 request, and key funding provisions in foreign aid appropriations bills. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1960s. U.S. aid to the region increased following President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress and again in the 1980s to support anti-leftist efforts. The United States provided significant support to the Contras in Nicaragua in the 1980s to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government. Aid flows declined in the mid-1990s but increased again in the late 1990s, with a focus on humanitarian and development assistance. After Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the U.S. provided extensive aid to Central American countries. The United States increased humanitarian and development assistance after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, establishing programs like PEPFAR and MCC. Aid was also provided to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. However, most aid through 2010 focused on counternarcotics and security programs. The United States provided significant aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors for counternarcotics and security programs, including the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico and Central America in FY2008. In FY2010, the Central America portion of M\u00e9rida became the Central America Regional Security Initiative. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance package for Mexico and Central America, was split into separate programs for Central America (CARSI) and the Caribbean (CBSI) in FY2010. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been decreasing since FY2010, with a decline in both absolute levels and proportion of aid going to the region. Between FY2008 and FY2012, U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion, a 10% decline. Aid to East Asia, the Pacific, and Europe also dropped, while aid to South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa increased. This shift reflects changes in U.S. foreign policy priorities towards development efforts in Africa and strategic regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The United States has shifted resources towards development efforts in Africa and strategic regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012. The Obama Administration has focused more on development and humanitarian assistance programs in the region to foster economic progress and social stability.

U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) covers Mexico and the Bahamas, while U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) covers the rest of the region. DOD assistance is funded through annual appropriations legislation, with Congress authorizing various humanitarian activities and goods transport. In FY2010, DOD provided $84 million in humanitarian assistance through nearly 200 projects in at least 28 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Assistance included projects like an alert warning system in Chile and the renovation of health centers in Panama. Haiti received the largest amount of assistance, totaling $34.8 million. In addition to providing humanitarian assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, DOD also assists partner countries in preparing for and responding to natural disasters and other emergencies. For example, after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, SOUTHCOM deployed a team to restore air traffic control, deliver supplies, and provide security within 24 hours. During humanitarian crises, DOD deploys a team of military engineers, planners, and communication specialists to provide air traffic control, deliver supplies, and ensure security for civilians. Despite USAID being the lead authority for disaster response, DOD often takes the initial response due to its capabilities. Additionally, DOD offers counterdrug support to Latin American and Caribbean nations, with independent authorities granted under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Section 1004 of the NDAA. The State Department coordinates U.S. counterdrug assistance, while DOD has independent authorities for counterdrug efforts. DOD provides training, transportation, reconnaissance, intelligence analysis, and nonlethal equipment to certain countries for counterdrug activities. In FY2010, DOD provided nearly $435 million in counterdrug assistance to the region, with Colombia and Mexico being the largest recipients.

In December 2011, MCC announced El Salvador's eligibility for a second compact. Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact in June 2005, with projects focusing on rural development and transportation. MCC terminated $10 million in funding for Honduras in 2009, reducing the total funding to $205 million. Honduras had $10 million in funding terminated by MCC after President Manuel Zelaya's ouster in 2009, reducing the total compact funding to $205 million. The compact was completed in September 2010, but MCC decided not to renew it in January 2011 due to corruption issues. However, Honduras remains eligible for a $20 million threshold program to address corruption and economic growth barriers. Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact in July 2005, focusing on the western region's economic potential with projects like road improvements and rural development. The MCC identified a region with economic growth potential in Nicaragua, with projects including transportation improvements, rural development, and land ownership regularization. $61.5 million in funding was suspended and terminated after disputed elections, reducing the total compact funding to $113.5 million.

The Peace Corps plans to close programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to their classification as upper-middle-income countries by the World Bank. In FY2013, the Peace Corps closed programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to their classification as upper-middle-income countries by the World Bank. Security concerns have led to the suspension of operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries, such as Haiti in 2005, Bolivia in 2008, and Honduras in 2012 due to high levels of violence. In December 2011, a volunteer in San Pedro Sula was shot during a robbery attempt on a public bus, leading to the suspension of the Honduras program in September 2012. The Peace Corps also cancelled volunteer training classes in El Salvador and Guatemala in December 2011 due to security concerns, but plans to send new volunteers in 2013. The Obama Administration's priorities for U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean include promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. The U.S. policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in the region account for 45% of the total aid budget, emphasizing the importance of improving public security to achieve other objectives. The FY2013 request also prioritizes assistance for Haiti. The FY2013 request prioritizes assistance for Haiti, with 20% of aid allocated to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. \"Peace and Security\" assistance accounts for 30% of aid to the region, focusing on counternarcotics, counterterrorism, security sector reform, and transnational crime. \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" programs receive about 24% of aid.

The Administration plans to reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, withdraw from certain sectors in the region, and close the USAID mission in Panama. Concerns have been raised about the proposed 10% decrease in aid for Latin America and the Caribbean, with a focus on maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in key countries. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is also a point of consensus, with calls for adequate monitoring to ensure transparency. Some Members have concerns about declines in assistance for programs in Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. There is consensus on providing assistance for Haiti's recovery, but some Members call for transparency and accountability in the aid program. Opposition exists towards parts of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for the region, including the Global Climate Change Initiative and increased funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Some committee members opposed cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, by $5 million and $3 million respectively, which they maintain \"are vital to help democracy advocates.\" House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measure that would reduce worldwide foreign aid funding. The House version potentially includes cuts to assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measure. The House version potentially includes cuts to assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean, raising questions about the effectiveness of aid programs in the region. The FY2013 State Department appropriations measure raises questions about the effectiveness of aid programs in Latin America. Congress is considering potential aid cuts and seeking ways to maximize impact through resource coordination. The U.S. government agencies managing foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, including State Department, USAID, and DOD, lack coordination and awareness of each other's efforts, leading to potential overlap. Despite some ongoing initiatives to improve coordination, there is no formal framework for sharing information among the agencies. The U.S. government agencies managing foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean lack coordination and awareness of each other's efforts, leading to potential overlap. Better coordination among these agencies could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of their programs. Congress could also consider closer coordination with other international donors, as Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in official development assistance in 2010, with the United States providing $2.7 billion. In 2010, Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in official development assistance, with the United States contributing $2.7 billion. Studies have shown a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could improve efficiency, but challenges include unclear leadership and differing objectives. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming to access new solutions and expertise while combining best practices with larger financial resources. The US has signed agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide access to new solutions and expertise, combining best practices with larger financial resources. Assistance includes strengthening Brazilian government agencies, implementing joint programs in third countries, and supporting Colombian efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement training. Support for emerging donors has potential benefits and drawbacks. Colombian government provides training and technical assistance to partners facing counternarcotics challenges. Critics raise oversight concerns about foreign assistance potentially supporting prohibited activities. Questions for Congress include agency roles, coordination mechanisms, and types of assistance programs. The need for clarification on agency roles, coordination mechanisms, and types of assistance programs in foreign aid provision is raised. Congress should also consider political will and program sustainability when determining assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations. When determining foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress should assess political will and program sustainability to ensure effective use of U.S. funds. Partner nations must be willing to implement reforms and sustain programs for long-term impact. The Colombian government is an example of a nation that has benefitted from U.S. assistance. The results of U.S. assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean may be limited as aid is reduced. Colombia has shown political will and program sustainability, allowing for a managed transition of assistance programs. USAID is closing missions in Panama and ending family planning programs in other countries as partner nations take over funding and management. Despite some successes, GAO reports indicate a lack of political will in some cases. Despite successes in family planning programs in Latin America, political will has often been lacking in the region to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. Reports show that U.S.-funded programs have struggled due to a lack of resources and funding after U.S. support ended. This includes difficulties in maintaining equipment and boats provided for counternarcotics programs. Even MCC-funded projects have faced challenges with program sustainability. Several countries in Latin America struggle to maintain U.S.-provided boats for patrol and interdiction operations due to funding issues. Even MCC-funded projects in Honduras face challenges with program sustainability, as municipalities lack resources for road maintenance. Questions for Congress to consider include the host country's capacity to maintain equipment and the long-term financial responsibility for assistance programs. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up its FY2013 appropriations bill for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012, totaling $48.3 billion. Key questions for Congress include the host country's capacity to maintain equipment, financial responsibility for assistance programs, and the need for political will to implement necessary reforms. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up its FY2013 appropriations bill for the Department of State, totaling $48.3 billion. The bill included funding for the core State Department and Foreign Operations budget as well as Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also marked up its bill, totaling $52.3 billion, with similar allocations for core State Department and Foreign Operations budget and Overseas Contingency Operations. Funding levels in FY2013 would have been lower than the previous year and the Obama Administration's request. The Senate marked up its FY2013 appropriations bill for the Department of State on May 24, totaling $52.3 billion, including $50 billion for the core State Department and Foreign Operations budget and $2.3 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for exceeding agreed-upon budget cuts and warned that it could harm national security and lead to higher long-term costs. Funding levels in FY2013 would have been lower than the previous year and the Administration's request. The House and Senate reports expressed concerns over conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean and intended to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request to some nations in the region. The House report recommended restoring reductions for key countries in Latin America to address immediate security needs, emphasizing support for counternarcotics, law enforcement, and rule of law activities in Mexico, Colombia, and Central America. The Committee emphasizes robust support for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in key countries in Latin America to combat drug trafficking and violent crime. Additional U.S. aid is recommended to strengthen democratic institutions in the region facing economic challenges and weak governmental institutions. The Committee recommends additional resources to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in Latin America, with specific funding levels specified for certain countries and programs. Both reports call for increased assistance for Colombia and Mexico, with the House report recommending additional funding for training and technical assistance in Colombia. The House report recommended increased funding for Colombia and Mexico, with specific allocations for training and technical assistance in Colombia and anti-crime efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border. The Senate report differed by prioritizing alternative development and economic development activities in the region. The Senate report recommended funding for economic development activities along the U.S.-Mexican border, with additional support for democracy programs in Venezuela. The House report prioritized funding for regional security programs like CARSI and CBSI. The House and Senate reports differed on funding levels for various programs in the region. The House recommended higher funding for democracy programs in Cuba and the Inter-American Foundation, while the Senate supported the requested levels for regional security programs. Ultimately, Congress did not take action on the appropriations bills. The House and Senate reports differed on funding levels for various programs in the region. The House recommended higher funding for democracy programs in Cuba and the Inter-American Foundation, while the Senate supported the requested levels for regional security programs. Ultimately, Congress did not take action on the appropriations bills. Congress delayed floor consideration of FY2013 appropriations bills until after the start of the new fiscal year and the November 2012 elections, enacting a six-month continuing resolution that expired in March 2013. New legislation (P.L. 113-6) was approved in March 2013, funding federal programs through the end of FY2013, subject to budget sequestration cuts. Funding for State Department-Foreign Operations in FY2013 was affected by budget sequestration cuts, reducing funding by about 5%. Country-level allocations for FY2013 were not yet available due to the account-level reductions."
