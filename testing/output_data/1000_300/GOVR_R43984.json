For example, Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify, but a cover version by Ryan Adams could still be heard. Copyright law allows artists to perform, reproduce, and distribute music under certain conditions as long as they pay royalties. Swift, as a singer who owns the rights to her recordings, can withdraw her own music from platforms. Taylor Swift can withdraw her recorded music from Spotify as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings. However, as a songwriter, she cannot control how the music service uses other recorded versions of her works. The amount she gets paid for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and federal laws. Congress created these laws when consumers primarily accessed music through radio or physical media. With the emergence of music distribution on the internet, Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address unauthorized use of copyrighted content and protect revenue sources in the music industry. Different copyright provisions were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. Music distribution has since evolved to include webcasting, downloading, and on-demand streaming of individual songs. The evolution of music distribution has blurred traditional lines of exploitation, with consumers now able to stream individual songs on demand via music streaming services. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of the Napster file-sharing service. In 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store, offering a legal option for purchasing songs online. By 2012, the recording industry earned more from digital downloads than retail sales. In 2012, the recording industry earned more from digital downloads than physical media, with Apple holding a 65% market share. However, sales from digital downloads began to decline as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. To compete, Apple launched Apple Music in 2015. Subscription music services have significantly changed music consumption patterns. The rise of subscription music services, like Apple Music, has transformed music consumption patterns. The proportion of total U.S. recording industry retail spending from digital subscriptions and streaming services increased from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017. Consumer spending on music remained flat between 2014 and 2015, then grew 10% between 2015 and 2016, and 14% between 2016 and 2017. Despite these changes, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers is still significantly below its 1999 peak, impacting how performers and music industry professionals are compensated. Annual spending on music by U.S. consumers, adjusted for inflation, is nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak. Changing consumption patterns impact how performers, songwriters, record companies, and music publishers are paid for their rights. Creators typically license their rights to third parties who may exercise them on their behalf. Owners of musical works and certain sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work to the public. The Copyright Act grants exclusive rights to owners of musical works, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work to the public. In music publishing, this combination of rights is known as a \"mechanical right,\" dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Music publishers issue mechanical licenses and collect royalties for the reproduction of musical compositions, despite changes in technology for music reproduction. The term \"mechanical rights\" in music refers to the reproduction and distribution rights granted to owners of musical works. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly. Some music services have agreements to pay royalties for sound recordings fixed before 1972. The Copyright Act grants owners of musical works and sound recordings the right to publicly perform works, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Examples of digital audio transmission services include webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services. Sound recording public performance rights under federal copyright laws are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers of compact discs purchase the rights to listen to each song on the disc as often as they wish in a private setting. Consumers of compact discs purchase the rights to listen to each song on the disc as often as they wish in a private setting. Rights owners of sound recordings pay music publishers for the right to distribute the publishers' works in physical formats. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels for sound recordings. Radio stations do not pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they do pay royalties to music publishers. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for broadcast music. Congress decided in 1995 that the promotional value of radio airplay outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Both traditional radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners. Noninteractive services like broadcast radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners, known as \"ephemeral recordings.\" On-demand or interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs upon request through conditional downloads, where digital files are downloaded to consumers' devices. Royalties are paid to music publishers and songwriters for these services. The music industry involves three main categories: songwriters and music publishers, recording artists and record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs to record labels. Music licensees obtain the right to reproduce, distribute, or perform music. Music publishers work with songwriters to promote songs to record labels and others who use music. They license the intellectual property of their clients and collect royalties. Publishers may pay advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. They monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music in various formats requiring mechanical licensing rights. During the term of the contract, music publishers monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music in various formats requiring mechanical licensing rights. They often contract with performing rights organizations to license and collect payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers share royalty income, with a standard 50-50 division between them. Music publishers fall into four general categories: Major Publishers. Music publishers are divided into four categories: Major Publishers (Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Music Group), Major Affiliates, Independent Publishers, and Writer-Publishers. Independent publishers administer their own music catalogs and are not affiliated with major publishers. Writer-publishers, such as established songwriters, control their own publishing rights and may hire individuals to handle royalties. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Major labels reproduce and distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings with large distribution networks. The major record labels distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings through large networks. They handle various functions related to selling digital songs, including adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists can either sign with a label or retain their copyrights and distribute their own music. Recording artists may contract with a record label or retain their copyrights to distribute their own sound recordings. They transfer copyrights to the label for defined periods and regions, receiving royalties in return. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds, and guide artists' careers. Major stars can negotiate full ownership of future sound recording copyrights. The three major record labels earn 65% of the industry's U.S. revenue: Sony Corporation (14.4%) and Universal Music Group. The three major record labels, Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, earn about 65% of the industry's U.S. revenue. While there are smaller record labels specializing in genres like country or jazz, they often rely on major labels for distribution. For example, Taylor Swift has a recording contract with independent label Big Machine Records. Chance the Rapper is an independent artist who retains his copyrights and distributes his music without signing with a record label. He gives his music away for free and earns money through touring and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive rights to his streaming-only album, Coloring Book, which became popular in the U.S. music industry. Chance the Rapper's album, Coloring Book, was the first streaming-only album to rank in the top 10 U.S. albums. Record producers are responsible for bringing creative products into tangible form, handling creative and administrative tasks. Artists now work with multiple producers, controlling their compensation terms. Sound engineers run recording sessions under producer oversight. Producers work directly with artists, controlling compensation terms. Sound engineers oversee recording sessions, while mixers piece together finished products. Mixers may receive one-time payments per track or a portion of artist royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the copyright owner's exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music. The 1909 Copyright Act allowed copyright owners to make mechanical reproductions of music, including audio-only copies for devices like player pianos. Concerns were raised about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company, which was buying exclusive rights from music publishers to control the market. In response to concerns about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company, Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allowed music publishers to withhold the right to reproduce a musical work, but once a sound recording was distributed to the public, others could make similar use of it by paying a specified royalty. For example, when Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album in 2015, he did not need her permission but paid a compulsory mechanical license fee set by the government. The compulsory mechanical license for music covers was established in response to concerns about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company. In 2015, when Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album 1989, he paid the government-set royalty rate without needing her permission. The 1909 Copyright Act initially set the royalty rate at $0.02 per \"part manufactured,\" which later changed to a \"per song\" basis under the Copyright Act of 1976. The Copyright Act of 1976 established the compulsory mechanical license for music, specifying rates payable for each record made and distributed. The law defines \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings and outlines procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses through serving a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner. The Copyright Act of 1976 established compulsory mechanical licenses for music, requiring licensees to file a notice of intention (NOI) with the copyright owner or Copyright Office within 30 days of making a new recording. Failure to provide the NOI makes the licensee ineligible for a compulsory license and may result in copyright infringement. The Copyright Act of 1976 established compulsory mechanical licenses for music, requiring licensees to file a notice of intention (NOI) with the copyright owner or Copyright Office within 30 days of making a new recording. In contrast to performance rights licenses, reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis, leading to controversy between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. The Copyright Act of 1976 established compulsory mechanical licenses for music, requiring licensees to file a notice of intention (NOI) with the copyright owner or Copyright Office within 30 days of making a new recording. In contrast to performance rights licenses, reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis. Controversy has arisen between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. Testimonies in the past have suggested simplifying the administration of compulsory licenses by establishing a separate royalty tribunal to set royalty rates based on standards established by Congress. Barbara Ringer proposed simplifying the administration of compulsory licenses by creating a separate royalty tribunal to set rates based on standards set by Congress. The tribunal, established in the 1976 Copyright Act, aims to maximize public access to works, ensure fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflect contributions to product availability, and minimize industry disruption. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what copyright owners may charge. Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act in 1995. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what copyright owners may charge. In 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) amending 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. Congress directed that rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries should distinguish between incidental and general transmissions, sparking a debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" In 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules to address the debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" After years of hearings and litigation, a landmark agreement was reached regarding the applicability of mechanical licenses to music streaming, crucial for the survival of the music industry in the digital age. In a landmark agreement, music publishers, the recording industry, songwriters, and music streaming services agreed on the application of mechanical licenses to streaming. Publishers were concerned about declining revenues from mechanical royalties due to the shift to streaming. The agreement involved streaming services paying publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive, audio-only streaming services like Pandora were exempt from obtaining mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted a modified version of this agreement in 2009, valid until 2012. In 2012, music industry groups reached a new agreement on mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services, covering 2013-2017. The CRB issued initial rates for 2018-2022, with flat rates for physical deliveries and downloads, and formula-based rates for interactive streaming based on service revenues or licensing costs. The mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services are based on a set of formulas that consider the music service's revenues or total licensing costs. These rates determine the amount of money available for distribution to publishers, with minimum per-subscriber payments for different types of services. During free trial periods, the royalty rate is zero, and oversight is provided by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District. Congress granted songwriters the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission from songwriters and/or publishers to perform their works. The sheer number and fleeting nature of public performances made it impossible for copyright owners to individually negotiate with each user for every use or to detect every case of infringement. To address the logistical issue of licensing public performances, composers formed ASCAP in 1914. ASCAP is a performance rights organization that issues licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers for a flat fee or percentage of revenues. PROs like ASCAP manage public performance rights and issue blanket licenses for musical works in their catalog. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. As radio broadcasting grew in popularity, SESAC expanded to represent U.S. composers. ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on a percentage of total revenues. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. To compete, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. ASCAP and BMI initially had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses. In 1940, a dispute over royalty rates between radio stations and ASCAP led to a DOJ investigation into possible antitrust violations. BMI entered a consent decree in 1941 to avoid a lawsuit, while ASCAP also agreed to terms after a lawsuit was filed. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated PROs for antitrust violations, leading to consent decrees with BMI and ASCAP in 1941. The decrees require nonexclusive licensing, non-discriminatory terms, and acceptance of qualifying members. Alternative licenses are offered, and royalty rate agreements are mandated. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated PROs for antitrust violations in 1941, leading to consent decrees with BMI and ASCAP. These decrees mandate nonexclusive licensing, non-discriminatory terms, and acceptance of qualifying members. ASCAP and BMI offer alternative licenses and must agree on royalty rates. SESAC and GMR negotiate rates independently. Federal district court judges oversee ASCAP and BMI rates, ensuring they are deemed \"reasonable.\" The rates charged by SESAC and GMR are based on marketplace negotiations, while ASCAP and BMI rates must be deemed \"reasonable\" by federal district court judges. ASCAP and BMI are noted to have \"disproportionate power over the market for music rights.\" Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. The provision for public performance royalties for sound recordings was created by Congress in 1995 with the passage of the DPRA. Concerns were raised about the impact on music performance royalties, known as the \"pie theory.\" The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have been periodically reviewed by the DOJ, with the last amendments in 2001 and 1994 respectively. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have been periodically reviewed by the DOJ, with the last amendments in 2001 and 1994 respectively. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was created to address unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was implemented to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. The House Judiciary Committee recommended amending federal copyright laws to address this issue, particularly focusing on excluding pre-1972 sound recordings to preserve existing antipiracy laws. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws equivalent to copyright, exempting pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection. Noninteractive digital services can make server reproductions under Section 112 of the Copyright Act. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to make temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rates and terms of this license are set by the CRB, and through SoundExchange, copyright owners receive Section 112 fees. Recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not receive these fees. Public Performance Royalties are received by copyright owners of sound recordings, usually record labels, through Section 112 fees. Before the 1990s, public performance rights were not granted to record labels and recording artists for their sound recordings. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 addressed concerns about music piracy by granting record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings. The DPRA in 1995 granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. This provision was a compromise between music publishers and record labels to prevent record companies from withholding licenses and affecting publishers' and writers' ability to earn public performance royalties. The DPRA in 1995 granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It represented a compromise between music publishers and record labels to prevent withholding licenses and affecting publishers' ability to earn royalties. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and set up rate-setting standards for the CRB. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services and established a bifurcated system of rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to a different standard aimed at representing negotiated rates in the marketplace. The DMCA established different rate-setting standards for music services, with one standard aiming to reflect negotiated rates in the marketplace. The Section 801(b)(1) standard includes a policy goal of minimizing disruption in industries, leading to lower copyright royalty rates in some cases. The DPRA allowed owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with music streaming services for public performance rights at market rates. The DPRA, established before July 31, 1998, allowed sound recording rights owners to negotiate with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at market rates. Interactive services enable individuals to arrange specific recording transmissions and were seen as a threat to traditional record sales by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995. Interactive services are seen as a threat to traditional record sales by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995, as they have the potential to significantly impact revenues derived from traditional record sales. Congress does not require broadcast radio stations to obtain public performance licenses from sound recording owners, aiming to strike a balance among various interested parties without jeopardizing the mutually beneficial relationship between the radio industry and the music industry. The Senate Judiciary Committee distinguishes broadcast radio from other services, stating that free over-the-air broadcasts provide entertainment, non-entertainment programming, and public interest activities to local communities. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Participants can engage in voluntary negotiations for three months before submitting written proposals. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Participants can engage in voluntary negotiations for three months before submitting written proposals. If parties do not reach an agreement, the CRB generally hears live testimony at an evidentiary hearing. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Participants can engage in voluntary negotiations for three months before submitting written proposals. If parties do not reach an agreement, the CRB generally hears live testimony at an evidentiary hearing. The CRB has the option to decline to adopt the agreement as a basis for statutory terms and rates for participants that are not parties to the agreement. Participants can request a rehearing if they disagree with the outcome, and challenge CRB determinations through an appeal filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. SoundExchange, established by RIAA as a common agent for record labels to receive and distribute royalties, deducts costs before distributing payments. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, deducts costs before distributing royalty payments. The CRB sets rates for public performances of sound recordings, using different standards for online music services and subscription services. Congress passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates. Some music streaming services and webcasters found CRB-ordered per-performance rates excessive, leading Congress to pass legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes. These agreements enabled services to pay royalties based on revenue percentage instead of per-performance rates. The most recent agreements expired in 2015, prompting the CRB to begin setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. Questions arose during the rate proceeding about the CRB's consideration of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. During the CRB rate proceeding for noninteractive music streaming services from 2016-2020, there was a dispute over whether agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts could be considered as evidence. SoundExchange argued that these agreements should be excluded, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed, stating that excluding them would invalidate all benchmark agreements proposed by parties. The CRB rate proceeding for noninteractive music streaming services from 2016-2020 involved a dispute over the use of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts as evidence. SoundExchange argued to exclude these agreements, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed, stating that excluding them would invalidate benchmark agreements proposed by parties. The CRB referred novel material questions of law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution, who ruled that the CRB may consider directly negotiated licenses reflecting provisions in a Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. The CRB issued its decision on rates for 2016-2020, requiring streaming services to pay $0.17 per 100 streams. The CRB issued rate decisions for noninteractive music streaming services from 2016-2020, tying annual rate increases to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees were set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties. In 2017, the CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for 2018-2022. Public performance rates vary based on the type of music service. The CRB issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for 2018-2022, with public performance rates varying based on the type of music service. Royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed among copyright owners, featured recording artists, nonfeatured musicians, and nonfeatured vocalists, but record producers are not included in the statutory split for public performances by noninteractive digital services. The act does not include record producers in the split of royalties for public performances by noninteractive digital services. Producers can be compensated via SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is debated under 17 U.S.C. Section 114. The CRB distinguishes between interactive and noninteractive services for setting rates for mechanical licenses, as outlined in 17 U.S.C. Sections 114 and 115. In 2009, the Second Circuit Court ruled on a case involving a music streaming service that uses user feedback to personalize song selections. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not an \"interactive\" service, based on the concern of cannibalization of record sales. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that an online radio service creating unique playlists for users is not considered interactive, as it does not guarantee predictability like purchasing music. This decision was based on concerns about cannibalization of record sales. The court ruled that LAUNCHcast, a noninteractive service, is eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Noninteractive services must limit features like announcing specific songs in advance. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora could obtain statutory licenses for public performances. Personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The rates set by the CRB do not differentiate between these services and others that transmit radio-style programming. Spotify offers on-demand access to albums, songs, and artists. Users can access limited songs for free with ads or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening on multiple devices. Congress provided antitrust exemptions to statutory licensees and copyright owners of sound recordings in 1995. Spotify allows ad-free music streaming on mobile and desktop, with offline listening. In 1995, Congress granted antitrust exemptions for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate royalty rates collectively. The exemptions require nonexclusive common agents to prevent supracompetitive rates. The DPRA does not cover antitrust issues for interactive services. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. However, copyright owners and entities can use common agents for a clearinghouse function, not rate-setting. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to the DMCA for ephemeral server reproductions, providing an antitrust exemption for negotiating royalty payments through common agents. Unlike Section 114(e)(1), Section 112(e)(2) does not require the designation to be nonexclusive. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) allows copyright owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating, paying, and receiving royalty payments for ephemeral recordings. Unlike Section 114(e)(1), Section 112(e)(2) does not specify that the designation must be nonexclusive. Congress created the CRB in 2004 with provisions regarding the obligation of licensees to make payments. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis. This allowed parties subject to statutory licensing to continue making payments while appealing CRB decisions until final rates are established. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange, but the CRB stated that copyright owners and performers are the designated agents according to the Copyright Act. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective to receive royalties, rejecting Royalty Logic's request to compete. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are the designated agents, and a single collective is the most efficient system for collecting royalties under statutory licenses. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective to receive royalties, citing the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for efficiency. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision, rejecting Royalty Logic's argument against exclusive payment rights. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single collective. SoundExchange was selected as the sole collective for the period 2011-2014, as no party had requested multiple collectives. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting royalties from licensees for the period 2011-2014. SoundExchange also reached agreements with public and college radio stations in 2015, which were approved by the CRB and made binding on all copyright owners and performers, regardless of SoundExchange membership. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting royalties from licensees for the period 2011-2014. SoundExchange was also designated as the sole collective for the rate period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses. In 2004, Congress extended the provision for negotiations and agreements related to traditional mechanical licenses, requiring owners and licenses to designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, who distribute royalties to publishers and songwriters. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in 2015. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association. In 2006, Royalty Logic raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. Noncash considerations may influence the price interactive services pay for music access. Noncash considerations may influence the price interactive services pay for music access, such as major labels acquiring equity stakes in Spotify. Sony shared proceeds with artists and independent labels from selling its stake. Rates for music publishers are tied to those for record labels for performance rights. The rates that interactive services pay music publishers are linked to the rates paid to record labels for performance rights, allowing music publishers to participate in deals involving equity stakes or advertising revenues. Copyright law prohibits tying rates for public performances of musical works to rates for sound recordings. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned about payments from digital music. Organizations representing songwriters and recording artists are worried about fair payment distribution from digital music services. ASCAP and BMI, representing 90% of songs for licensing in the US, are not-for-profit. SESAC and Global Music Rights also play a role in performance rights licensing. Publishers claim they are not receiving their fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services. Music publishers may affiliate with multiple PROs but songwriters can only choose one. Publishers allege they have not received a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. Publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to negotiate directly with digital services for market rates. ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license their public performance rights for new media uses. The courts ruled that music publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights from PROs under consent decrees, leading to a request for modifications by major publishers and PROs to allow partial grants of rights. After court rulings, major music publishers and PROs requested modifications to consent decrees to allow partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration, and bundled licenses. DOJ evaluated the consent decrees in 2014 and solicited comments in 2015 on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing\" for musical works with multiple writers. The DOJ completed its review in 2016 and announced that the consent decrees required PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs, promoting competition. DOJ suggested that Congress reconsider how copyright law is applied to the music industry. The DOJ called on Congress to reconsider copyright law in the music industry, suggesting a more comprehensive legislative solution. BMI filed a lawsuit in New York, where Judge Stanton ruled in favor of fractional licensing. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision. The process of serving a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder for royalties was also discussed. The Copyright Office announced new procedures for licensees to file Notices of Intention (NOIs) in bulk electronic form under Section 115. This change reduced filing costs significantly, allowing licensees to file an NOI for up to 100 songs at once. Following this change, licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk. The Copyright Office reduced filing costs for NOIs from $2 to $0.10 per song, with an upfront fee of $75. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google started filing NOIs in bulk after the change. Digital music service companies pushed for digitizing the licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. In 2015, digital music service companies advocated for digitizing the compulsory licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. Lawsuits were filed against Spotify and other online music services for streaming copyrighted musical works. The Music Modernization Act, passed in April 2018, creates a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer blanket mechanical licenses and change the process of suing for infringement. The Music Modernization Act creates a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer blanket mechanical licenses and change the process of suing for infringement. It also extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 and establishes procedures for royalty payments to producers, mixers, and sound engineers. Online music services can pay for a broad blanket mechanical license under the bill. The Music Modernization Act establishes a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) for royalty payments to producers, mixers, and sound engineers. Online music services will fund the MLC through assessment rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB). The MLC will have a 17-member board of directors and will be reviewed every five years. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) will have a 17-member board of directors funded by online music services through assessment rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB).
