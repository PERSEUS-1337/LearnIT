    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a high incidence and mortality rate. The disease is projected to increase significantly, especially among minority communities. Additionally, lung cancer causes more deaths annually than the next 4 leading causes of cancer deaths combined. Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer combined. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 percent, while breast cancer has an 89 percent survival rate. Despite its impact, lung cancer research is underfunded compared to other major cancers. Research for lung cancer is significantly underfunded compared to other cancers, despite its high mortality rate. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants. Lung cancer is stigmatized and often blamed on patients, regardless of smoking history. Lung cancer, influenced by hormonal and genetic factors, is highly stigmatized and often blamed on patients, even those who never smoked. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers, with 2/3 of them being women. It is the leading cause of cancer death across all major ethnic groups. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in all major ethnic groups, with a higher impact on African-American males. Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk. Only 16% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no targets for early detection or treatment in health initiatives. An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 showed that early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. A study by the National Cancer Institute in 2009 projected a cost of over $433 billion per year lost to lung cancer by 2020, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could cut that in half. The National Cancer Institute's 2010 National Lung Screening Trial yielded initial results. The National Cancer Institute's 2010 National Lung Screening Trial found a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer deaths among participants screened with low-dose helical CT scans. This could potentially save over $433 billion annually by 2020. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020, involving various government agencies and stakeholders. The program includes specific requirements for the National Institutes of Health. The program aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. Requirements include a strategic review of research grants by the National Cancer Institute and funding for research on predispositions to lung cancer and related diseases. The National Cancer Institute aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020 through research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and innovative screening and treatment methods funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. The National Cancer Institute aims to reduce lung cancer mortality through various programs funded by different institutes, such as the Quantum Grant Program and Image-Guided Interventions programs. Funds are provided to research programs on lung cancer incidence and collaborate on prevention, early detection, and disease management research for minority populations. The Food and Drug Administration is also involved in these efforts. The National Cancer Institute funds programs to reduce lung cancer mortality, including research on incidence, prevention, and management for minority populations. The Food and Drug Administration provides funds for quality standards, guidelines, and compliance reviews for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides access to early detection services for high-risk populations. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducts research on environmental contaminants linked to lung cancer in the workplace. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducts research on environmental contaminants associated with lung cancer in the workplace and implements measures to reduce lung cancer risk. State, tribal, and territorial plans under the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program must include lung cancer mortality reduction measures. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reviews lung cancer early detection methods, diagnostic protocols, and treatment guidelines annually. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program focuses on early detection methods, treatment protocols, and updated guidelines. It also emphasizes cooperation among programs for women, minorities, and underserved populations to address the burden of lung cancer. Additionally, there is coordination with tobacco control and cessation programs to achieve the program's goals. The Department of Health and Human Services aims to coordinate tobacco control and cessation programs to achieve the goals of the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, focusing on early detection and treatment protocols. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in developing and implementing programs for lung cancer reduction and screening for military personnel and veterans. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will lead the project in collaboration with various agencies and experts. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project will be established by key health officials to identify optimal risk populations, develop effective screening processes, and ensure continuous quality improvements. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project aims to benefit from screening by developing effective, safe, and cost-efficient processes for early disease management. It also focuses on continuous quality improvements and serves as a model for integrating health information technology into the healthcare system. The Secretary will select various healthcare centers to carry out the demonstration project, including National Cancer Institute Centers, Department of Defense Medical Treatment Centers, Veterans Affairs Healthcare Network sites, International Early Lung Cancer Action Program sites, and community health centers for minority and underserved populations. Quality standards and guidelines for licensing of tomography will be established. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer through the demonstration project. This includes the requirement for a quality assurance and control program to ensure equipment reliability and interpretation accuracy, as well as setting standards for radiation dose levels. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer through a 5-year demonstration project. Reports on the projected cost and progress of the project will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer through a 5-year demonstration project. Reports on the projected cost and progress of the project will be submitted to Congress. Additionally, a Lung Cancer Advisory Board will be established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board to monitor programs, provide annual reports to Congress, and include representatives from various relevant fields. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board will include representatives from various fields appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is provided to carry out the Act and its amendments."
