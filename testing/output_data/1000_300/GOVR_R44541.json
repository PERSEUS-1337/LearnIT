    "content": "Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves exploiting the international trade system to transfer value and hide the origins of illicit wealth. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, involve misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. Financial institutions can be involved in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when used to settle or finance international trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising the source and beneficiaries of funds through international trade transactions. Financial institutions can be implicated in TBML schemes when used to settle, facilitate, or finance trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury identified TBML as a challenging form of money laundering, capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. The U.S. Department of the Treasury identified trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a challenging form of money laundering, capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. TBML schemes involve disguising the source and beneficiaries of funds through international trade transactions. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers also use the international financial system and physical cash movement to disguise their activities. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising funds through international trade transactions, exploiting complexities in foreign exchange and trade financing, co-mingling legitimate and illicit funds, and using limited customs resources to avoid detection. Money launderers utilize letters of credit and other financial arrangements to launder funds, often combining TBML techniques with other money laundering methods to obscure the money trail. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising funds through international trade transactions by over- and under-invoicing goods and services. This technique is commonly used to shift funds across borders, with exporters invoicing below market value to transfer funds to importers, and vice versa. TBML techniques are often combined with other money laundering methods to obscure the money trail. Over- and under-invoicing in international trade involves transferring value between importers and exporters by manipulating prices. Collusion between parties is necessary for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and supply chains make it harder for customs officials to determine true market value. Multiple invoicing for the same goods or services can be used by money launderers or terrorist financiers to justify multiple payments. Money launderers and terrorist financiers can manipulate prices and quantities of goods and services in international trade to justify multiple payments and complicate detection efforts by customs officials. Collusion between parties can also lead to over- and under-shipments, further complicating the detection of illicit activities. Money launderers manipulate prices and quantities of goods and services in international trade to justify multiple payments and complicate detection efforts. They can misstate the quantity, quality, or type of goods being traded, creating discrepancies in value. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a common scheme involving the laundering of drug proceeds from Latin America. TBML, including the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE), is a prevalent method used by money launderers to disguise drug proceeds. It is recognized as a common form of international money laundering and is utilized by terrorist organizations for value transfer and reconciliation. Despite being less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional methods like banking system laundering and cash smuggling, TBML's impact on global trade can have significant consequences. TBML, or trade-based money laundering, is a method used by money launderers to disguise illicit proceeds. It can have a more destructive impact on legitimate commerce than other money laundering schemes, according to the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment. Transnational criminal organizations may sell imported goods purchased with illegal funds at below-market prices to expedite the money laundering process, putting legitimate businesses at a disadvantage and hindering economic activity. TBML involves selling imported goods at below-market prices to launder money, creating barriers to entrepreneurship and reducing tax revenue for governments. Global trends in trade have been exploited by criminal organizations to hide illegal gains. Global trends in communications and transportation, along with the digital revolution, global value chains, and urbanization, have interconnected economies and societies, creating new market opportunities. Organized crime has expanded into these global markets, diversifying into profitable activities with low detection risks. Criminal groups have adapted to global market trends by adopting new types of illicit trade to connect production to distant consumers efficiently. The OECD found that criminal groups have adapted to global market trends by engaging in new types of illicit trade to connect production to distant consumers. This illegal trade poses challenges for law enforcement and could have significant economic and development consequences, as it allows criminal organizations and terrorist groups to exploit the international trade system with low risk of detection. The FATF highlights key characteristics of the international trade system that make it attractive and vulnerable to illicit activities. The international trade system is vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups due to its vast potential and low risk of detection. Key vulnerabilities identified by FATF include the enormous volume of trade flows, complexity of foreign exchange transactions, comingling of illicit funds with legitimate business cash flows, limited verification procedures for customs data exchange between countries, and limited resources for customs agencies to detect illegal trade. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is increasing in volume and global reach. TBML activities were most frequently identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. The U.S. Department of State's 2016 report highlighted TBML concerns in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, and Cambodia. Limited resources, verification procedures, and comingling of illicit funds with legitimate business cash flows contribute to the vulnerability of the international trade system to TBML. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 report, trade-based money laundering (TBML) concerns have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. TBML is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, corruption of customs authorities, and exploitation of free trade zones. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, corruption of customs authorities, exploitation of free trade zones, and laundering of proceeds. While some known terrorist groups have used TBML, it is not a dominant method for terrorist financing according to the Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment. The Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment concluded that TBML is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. U.S. law enforcement investigations show that physical movement of cash and movement through the banking system are more prevalent methods, with TBML accounting for only 15 percent of cases. The State Department identified TBML as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, involving hawala brokers and corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking presence, relying on a network of trusted money brokers. Settlement among hawaladars does not always involve financial institutions. The State Department's 2016 annual report highlighted concerns about unregulated hawala systems being vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. Some specific countries, like those involved in the Afghanistan/Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement, are identified as potential targets for trade-based money laundering and terrorist financing schemes. The State Department's 2016 report identified vulnerable countries to TBML/FT schemes, such as Afghanistan/Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement routes known for TBML. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in TBML schemes with vehicles and weapons linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships for vehicle purchases exported to Lebanon and Jordan with hidden weapons. TBML schemes involving vehicles and weapons linked to Hezbollah are prevalent in Lebanon. Funds from Jordanian and Lebanese entities are used to purchase vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan, with hidden weapons. The ultimate destination of the vehicles is unknown, and proceeds may be directed back to Hezbollah. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The United Arab Emirates reports that TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern, with Hezbollah deriving financial support from drug and money laundering schemes involving TBML. The Lebanese Canadian Bank facilitated illegal drug trafficking from South America to Europe and the Middle East via West Africa, laundering hundreds of millions of dollars monthly. They also engaged in trade-based money laundering through used car dealerships in the United States and Asian-supplied consumer goods shipped to Latin America. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was involved in illegal drug trafficking and money laundering through various schemes. The bank's license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to another bank. Individuals and entities linked to this network have faced financial sanctions and law enforcement investigations. Cash payments from narcotics trafficking were laundered through a Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler in the late 2000s. In the late 2000s, owners of the Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking. The funds were laundered through a BMPE scheme by placing small deposits under $10,000 into the company's bank account to avoid reporting requirements. The cash deposits were used to purchase toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. Colombian pesos generated from toy sales were used to reimburse Colombian drug traffickers through the BMPE. Some employees of Woody Toys had previously worked for Angel Toy Company, implicated in a similar toys-for-drugs scheme. Some employees of Woody Toys had connections to Angel Toy Company, both involved in a toys-for-drugs scheme. Law enforcement benefited from US-Colombia trade data sharing through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance managed by an Indian national in Dubai. In the early 2000s, a major international drug trafficking operation was managed by an Indian national living in Dubai. The operation involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance, with connections to businesses in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States. The individual opened letters of credit through his companies for importers, benefiting affiliated exporters in India and other locations with inflated export values and bogus trade documents. The individual utilized his businesses' connections with banks to transmit LCs to affiliated exporters in India, along with drug trafficking funds, disguised as trade financing. The inflated LCs were used to remit funds to India, where the drug proceeds were distributed and exports sold at market value. Additionally, he moved funds offshore through hawala operators by falsifying trade documents to export banned goods from India. The individual facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents through his network of businesses in India. Hawala operators were used to settle the difference between the true and fraudulent value of the goods. U.S. government policy responses to address TBML include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and Treasury Department regulatory responses. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in 1989 to develop AML/CFT guidelines and currently has 34 member countries and 2 regional organizations. FATF conducts annual self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines, with the ability to suspend non-compliant members. In 1990, FATF issued 40 recommendations to combat money laundering, with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leading the U.S. delegation to FATF. The Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to the FATF, supporting global efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The delegation includes members from various government departments and implements actions domestically to meet U.S. commitments to the FATF. The U.S. delegation to the FATF includes members from various government departments and implements actions domestically to meet U.S. commitments. The FATF adopted revised recommendations in 2012 and 2015 to address new threats and strengthen existing obligations, aiming to deepen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, build partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The revised FATF recommendations aim to strengthen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, build partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The new standards focus on higher-risk situations and transparency requirements for beneficial ownership information to address tax transparency, corporate governance, and criminal activity. Recommendations to counter TBML are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. The FATF 40 Recommendations do not include specific recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering (TBML), despite recognizing the increased opportunities for abuse in the international trade and financing system. Surveys by the FATF show a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of TBML, attributed to jurisdictions not identifying it separately from general money laundering activities. Training related to TBML is also lacking in most jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions do not identify trade-based money laundering (TBML) separately from general money laundering activities, leading to a lack of data collection and specific training on TBML. The FATF recommends developing training programs focused on financial and trade data analysis to detect TBML activities. FinCEN plays a central role in combating TBML through issuing advisories and applying special measures to high-risk jurisdictions. The Treasury Department's FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML). These advisories red flag activities indicative of money laundering and provide specific red flags to aid financial institutions in reporting suspicious activity related to TBML. Reporting on suspected TBML was found to be inconsistent, prompting the advisory to request more vigilance from financial institutions. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on trade-based money laundering (TBML) involving funnel accounts after restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. Funnel accounts receive multiple cash deposits below reporting thresholds and withdraw funds in different areas quickly. Specific red flags were provided for this activity. FinCEN issued an advisory on trade-based money laundering involving funnel accounts, used by Mexican criminal organizations. Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) are being utilized to combat this activity, imposing recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions in specific areas for up to 180 days. Violators may face civil or criminal penalties. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO targeting Miami-based electronics exporters to combat TBML schemes by drug and crime organizations. The GTO required reporting any cash transactions over $3,000, aiming to enhance U.S. efforts against TBML. FinCEN renewed the GTO in October 2015, lowering cash reporting to $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by drug and crime organizations. This GTO targeted businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to frustrate drug traffickers exploiting the fashion industry for money laundering. FinCEN can impose regulatory special measures on foreign entities involved in money laundering. These measures range from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain types of accounts. OFAC also administers financial sanctions on designated foreign nationals and entities. Two cases involving TBML were designated in April 2013. In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, for their involvement in TBML. They facilitated transactions for a large-scale TBML scheme and provided money laundering services for an international narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade task force within DHS. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to examine trade anomalies and financial irregularities linked to Hezbollah's money laundering network. TTUs in various countries are funded by the Department of State's INL to investigate TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), HSI, and Treasury have established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) in various countries to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML). These TTUs are part of a broader plan to create an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritized tackling TBML domestically and abroad, with ICE-led TTUs facilitating the exchange and analysis of trade data. The State Department reports a growing number of TBML investigations resulting from TTU activities, with over $1 billion seized since the inception of the U.S. and foreign-based TTU effort. The U.S. and foreign-based Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) have seized over $1 billion since their creation. The 114th Congress has addressed trade-based money laundering (TBML) in hearings focusing on specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security in Latin America. Witnesses have raised concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML and the resources allocated to TTUs. Discussions have also touched on the potential link between U.S. trade policy, free trade agreements, and commitments to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the connection between trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing, with concerns raised about the effectiveness of efforts to combat TBML. The Treasury Department's national risk assessments downplayed the link between terrorism and TBML, but policymakers remain worried, citing examples involving Hezbollah. In response, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was enacted to address these concerns. Some policymakers are concerned about links between trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing, particularly implicating Hezbollah. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was enacted by the 114th Congress to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. OFAC issued a final rule in April 2016 to implement this act. President Obama has affirmed his Administration's commitment to addressing these issues. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was implemented by OFAC in April 2016 to address Hezbollah's financing activities. President Obama has pledged to take strong action against Hezbollah operatives. The Treasury Department aims to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools to combat trade-based money laundering. Congress may continue to monitor the implementation of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 and other financial tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML). Hearings in the 114th Congress discussed TBML, with one specifically focusing on the topic. The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have held hearings on terrorist financing trends and efforts to stop terror finance. The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have conducted hearings on terrorist financing trends and measures to combat terror finance. The committees have addressed various topics such as preventing cultural genocide by ISIS, examining the state of the international financial system, and reviewing defense authorization requests for fiscal year 2017. The Senate Armed Services Committee, United States Strategic Command, United States Northern Command, and United States Southern Command programs and budget were reviewed in relation to the Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2017 and the Future Years Defense Program on March 10, 2016. The House Financial Services Committee's Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing discussed helping the developing world fight terror finance on March 1, 2016, and also addressed trade-based money laundering as a growing industry in terror finance on February 3, 2016. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade focused on terrorist financing related to kidnapping and antiquities trafficking. Laundering is a significant aspect of terror finance, discussed in various congressional committees such as the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The focus is on terrorist financing through activities like kidnapping, antiquities trafficking, and private donations. The House Homeland Security Committee and House Financial Services Committee have held hearings on border security and terrorism financing. The House Judiciary Committee has also addressed immigration and customs enforcement oversight issues. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has focused on securing the border. The House Judiciary Committee, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and House Financial Services Committee have addressed various issues such as immigration and customs enforcement oversight, securing the border, Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere, and the state of the international financial system in hearings held in March and April 2015."
