    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental concerns. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and submission to the President and Congress for approval. The OCSLA requires the DOI to develop five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental concerns. The process involves examining areas, narrowing selections based on economic and environmental analysis, and submitting proposals to the President and Congress for approval. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA, which considers potential environmental impacts and alternatives. Public comments from stakeholders are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program itself. The final version of the oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was released by BOEM on November 18, 2016, and approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. The program was revised from a proposed program in March 2016 and a draft in January 2015. The Administration could not revise a finalized program without restarting the process, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. The final version of the oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. The program includes 11 lease sales on the OCS, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Sales proposed in earlier versions for the Atlantic and Alaska were not included. Congress plays a role in reviewing BOEM's final program under the OCSLA. Congress plays a role in reviewing BOEM's final five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs, influencing them through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress was actively involved in shaping the proposed program for 2017-2022. The 114th Congress influenced the proposed program for 2017-2022 through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The report discusses the history and legal framework for BOEM's offshore oil and gas leasing programs, development process, previous programs, and analysis of the 2017-2022 program. Congress enacted laws in 1953 addressing jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States. In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA to address jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States, including regulation of subsurface oil and natural gas exploration. The OCSLA aims for expedited and orderly development of OCS resources while maintaining environmental safeguards and national needs. Congress sought ways to expedite exploration and production as offshore activities expanded. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added provisions to the OCSLA to allow for expedited exploration and production while maintaining environmental safeguards and competition. This included the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. The OCSLA mandates the creation of a leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. Amendments and acts like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 have altered offshore oil and gas exploration and production. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain regions for oil and gas exploration, sharing revenues with Gulf states, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congress removed language to allow leasing in certain OCS regions, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA for BOEM's development of offshore oil and gas leasing programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program that considers economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources. Section 18 of OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS in a way that considers economic, social, and environmental values. It directs the scheduling of oil and gas exploration based on various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws. Leasing under the five-year program must ensure fair market value for the leased lands. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS considering economic, social, and environmental values. Leasing under the five-year program must ensure fair market value for the leased lands and involve consultation with various stakeholders. The OCSLA mandates consultation with stakeholders, including the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, for proposed programs. The Secretary must submit the program to affected states' governors for comments 60 days before publication. The Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission can comment on competition effects. The proposed program must be submitted to Congress and the President for approval at least 60 days before. The OCSLA requires consultation with stakeholders, including the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, for proposed programs. The Secretary must submit the program to affected states' governors for comments 60 days before publication. Comments on competition effects can be submitted. The final five-year program can be approved after these steps, with the Secretary authorized to revise it at any time. The responsibilities under the OCSLA are carried out by BOEM. The Secretary of the Interior's responsibilities under the OCSLA are carried out by BOEM, which includes consultation requirements with affected states' governors. The preparation of the five-year program involves sending letters to governors to identify specific laws, goals, and policies. The program is also published in the Federal Register. NEPA and CZMA are federal statutes that play a significant role in the program's formation, requiring detailed environmental impact statements and alternatives to be prepared by federal agencies. The preparation of the five-year program by BOEM involves compliance with federal statutes NEPA and CZMA, which require detailed environmental impact statements for major federal actions. The significance of the program's impact on the environment is assumed without conducting an environmental assessment. The BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) alongside the five-year program to assess environmental impact and alternatives. States under CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat protection. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance for conservation measures and land/water use designations. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) allows approved state programs to receive federal assistance for conservation measures and land/water use designations. The BOEM regulations require consideration of state coastal zone management programs in the development of leasing programs for OCS oil and gas activities. The regulations require BOEM to request information on the relationship between a state's coastal zone management program and OCS oil and gas activity from affected coastal states and the Secretary of Commerce. BOEM's five-year program development involves multiple drafts for review, consultation with state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each step includes public comment and environmental review. Individual lease sales and exploration plans also undergo environmental review and public comment. The process of developing the five-year program for oil and gas leasing involves multiple drafts, public comment, and environmental review. Each stage, from the initial proposed program to actual production, undergoes analysis and review, leading to a narrowing down of areas for lease sales and further environmental assessment. Section 18 of the OCSLA guides the development of a schedule for proposed lease sales based on public input. The proposed program (PP) focuses on areas listed in the initial schedule for further analysis and environmental review. BOEM can remove proposed sales in later stages but cannot add new sales without additional environmental reviews. The process begins with a Request for Information (RFI) to gather input on energy needs and leasing interests for the next five-year period. BOEM initiates development of a new five-year program by requesting information on energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. The draft proposed program is published after analyzing public comments from the request for information. BOEM publishes a draft proposed program (DPP) after analyzing public comments from the request for information. The DPP outlines lease sales in the next five years and includes a preliminary schedule. BOEM received over 1 million comments on the 2017-2022 DPP. Additionally, a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) is issued for the proposed lease areas, seeking public input on issues to be analyzed. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) publishes a proposed program (PP) for the 2017-2022 period, refining lease sale locations and timing based on public comments. The PP is accompanied by a draft PEIS for analysis of OCS areas. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) submits the Proposed Program (PP) to Congress, state governors, and federal agencies, seeking public comment. The PP for 2017-2022 was published on March 15, 2016, with a comment period closing on June 16, 2016. A draft PEIS analyzing OCS areas for leasing was also released. The Final Program/Final PEIS (PFP) is based on additional analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments on the PP. The PFP for 2017-2022 was published by BOEM. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) submits the Proposed Program (PP) to Congress, state governors, and federal agencies for public comment. The Final Program/Final PEIS (PFP) for 2017-2022 was published on November 18, 2016, and submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, with former Secretary Sally Jewell approving the final program on January 17, 2017. The Secretary of the Interior approves the Final Program (PFP) for offshore oil and gas leasing, which becomes final after a record of decision is published. Former Secretary Sally Jewell approved the 2017-2022 program on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, multiple five-year programs reflecting different administrations' policies have been submitted to Congress and approved after a 60-day review period. The Obama Administration submitted the 2012-2017 five-year gas leasing program to Congress, including 15 proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Two Alaska sales were later canceled, and as of late November 2016, 11 lease sales had been held. The George W. Bush Administration prepared the 2007-2012 program, reflecting their policies on offshore energy development. The 2007-2012 five-year program was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration and submitted to Congress. It went into effect in July 2007 with a schedule of 21 sales, later revised to 16 sales by the Obama Administration. Eleven sales were held before the program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan was submitted to Congress in 2002 under former Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan, part of a five-year program, included 20 lease sales with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1997-2002 program had 16 sales, with 12 held before expiring in June 2002. The 1992-1997 program included 16 sales, with details presented to Congress in 1992. The 1982-1997 OCS oil and gas leasing programs were established during different administrations, with varying numbers of sales held before each program expired. The programs were presented to Congress under different Secretaries of the Interior, reflecting the energy policies of the respective administrations. The sale schedule included 42 sales, with 17 held before the program expired in June 1992. The program was presented to Congress in 1982 under Secretary James Watt, aligning with Reagan Administration's energy policies. Another program from 1980-1982 had 41 sales, with 23 held before expiring in June 1987. Additionally, a program from 1980 had 36 proposed sales, with 12 held before being succeeded by the 1982-1987 program. The Department of the Interior (DOI) proposed 36 sales in April 1980 under Secretary Cecil D. Andrus, with 12 sales held. This program was followed by the 1982-1987 program. Prior to 1980, over 3,000 tracts were leased from 1954 to 1980. In November 2016, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) released the final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The OCS regions include the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific regions, with lease sales planned in two of these regions. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) identifies four OCS regions with a total of 26 planning areas. The regions are the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific. The 2017-2022 final program schedules lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015, a decline from FY2010. Offshore production volumes decreased by 12% during this period, while total U.S. crude production increased by 73% to 9.4 million barrels per day. Offshore natural gas production also declined to 4% of total production in FY2015. In FY2015, U.S. offshore crude oil production volumes declined by 12%, while total U.S. crude production reached near-record levels of 9.4 million barrels per day, a 73% increase from FY2010. Offshore natural gas production fell to 4% of total production, a 50% decrease from FY2010. Meanwhile, total U.S. annual natural gas production rose by over 30% to 28.7 trillion cubic feet, driven by increased production of shale gas and shale oil in onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford. This surge in U.S. oil and gas production has helped reduce imports from OPEC countries. The increased U.S. oil production from unconventional onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford has reduced imports from OPEC countries. Onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs compared to deepwater plays offshore. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects in a low price environment. In a low oil and natural gas price environment, the demand for new offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be soft, impacting future production levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects from 2015-2020. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) estimates a decrease in bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years, with bonus bid revenues dropping from $1 billion annually to around $500 million annually. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have also decreased from $80-$90 per barrel to $50-$60 per barrel. Bonus bid revenues for FY2017-FY2021 were around $500 million annually. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates decreased from $80-$90 per barrel to $50-$60 per barrel. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. Energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, remains vital according to BOEM's 2017-2022 PP. BOEM emphasized the importance of energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, in their 2017-2022 PP. Oil and gas exploration and production involve stages where data certainty about resource volumes increases. Undiscovered resources are estimated before drilling, while reserves are measured after discovery and reported to the SEC. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. BOEM estimates 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas as undiscovered resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS due to no discoveries. The U.S. OCS has significant undiscovered oil and gas resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. BOEM must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when preparing five-year programs under the OCSLA. Some areas were not available for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or other reasons. Some areas of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. This included regions in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. President Obama withdrew certain ocean areas in the Alaska region from leasing through 2022, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing activities. In December 2016, additional withdrawals were made for much of the U.S. Arctic for an indefinite period. In December 2016, President Obama made additional withdrawals under the OCSLA, including much of the U.S. Arctic from leasing disposition for an indefinite time period and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals did not directly affect the 2017-2022 program but would impact future leasing considerations. BOEM's \"tailored leasing strategy\" separately considers each of the four U.S. ocean regions. The BOEM's \"tailored leasing strategy\" considers various factors for leasing in different U.S. ocean regions. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The final program by BOEM includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, accounting for almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. OCS. The Gulf of Mexico region is the most mature, with the most abundant resources and infrastructure, and it accounts for 97% of all U.S. offshore production. The Gulf of Mexico region has the most abundant oil and gas resources, with 97% of all U.S. offshore production. Majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in the Gulf region, which includes three BOEM planning areas. The 2017-2022 program in the Gulf of Mexico has replaced area-specific sales with region-wide sales, offering all available lease blocks in each sale. This change provides greater flexibility to industry and fewer lease sales compared to previous programs. The 2017-2022 program in the Gulf of Mexico schedules fewer lease sales, including 12 Gulf sales, compared to previous programs. Concerns were raised about the decrease in lease sales during congressional hearings. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region has increased due to the shrinking summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to the shrinking summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season. Recent estimates of substantial undiscovered oil and gas resources in Arctic waters have also increased interest. Challenges such as severe weather, perennial sea ice, and lack of infrastructure continue to pose obstacles to new exploration. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, aim to expand offshore oil and gas activities in the region. The Obama Administration supported expanding offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, but also implemented safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Lease sales were planned in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet, but were later canceled in 2015 due to market challenges. Stakeholders have differing views on Arctic drilling, with concerns about oil spills and climate change. BOEM's five-year program for 2012-2017 included lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet. However, sales for the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas were canceled in 2015 due to market conditions. Despite support for sales in these areas, BOEM decided against them for the final program, citing other factors. BOEM decided against lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi planning areas due to declining industry interest, low oil prices, and Shell Oil Company's unsuccessful drilling efforts in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. The agency cited opportunities for exploration on existing leases, the unique Arctic ecosystem, and sufficient domestic energy sources as reasons for the decision. In the Arctic OCS, industry interest declined significantly due to low oil prices and Shell Oil Company's failed drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. The number of active leases dropped by over 90% between February and November 2016, with companies relinquishing leases rather than investing further. BOEM noted that future interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas may increase post-2017-2022. President Obama later withdrew parts of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration indefinitely. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration for an indefinite time period, excluding a lease sale in the Atlantic region that was proposed in the final program for 2017-2022. Congressional bans and presidential moratoria had limited oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years. The limitation of oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years was due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria. Changes in legislation and administrative withdrawals allowed for potential lease sales in the Atlantic, but as of December 2016, certain parts of the region are under presidential moratorium again. No Atlantic lease sale has occurred despite the possibility. The Atlantic region has faced limitations on oil and gas activity due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria. Despite the potential for lease sales in the region, certain parts are currently under a presidential moratorium. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region, leading to a planned lease sale in 2021, which was later removed due to strong local opposition and conflicts with other ocean uses. BOEM removed the Atlantic sale in the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021 due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, current market dynamics, and feedback from Governors of affected states. The agency cited conflicts with existing uses like tourism, fishing, shipping, and defense activities as reasons for the removal. The lack of a history of offshore mineral production in the Atlantic raised concerns about drilling among those who use the ocean for competing purposes. In the Gulf of Mexico, offshore mineral production has a long history. However, the Atlantic region has little history in this regard, leading to concerns about drilling. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to the increasing onshore oil and gas production meeting national energy needs. No lease sales are scheduled for the Pacific region in the 2017-2022 program. The 2017-2022 program for the Pacific region does not include any lease sales, with no federal oil and gas lease sales held in the region since 1984. Congressional and presidential leasing moratoria have restricted offshore oil and gas leasing in the Pacific region for the past 30 years. Despite the lifting of these restrictions in FY2009, the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington still oppose offshore leasing in the region. Congress can influence the development of the program through public comments, oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter the program's terms. The 114th Congress and the 115th Congress could influence the 2017-2022 program for the Pacific region by submitting public comments, holding oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter the program's terms. Members of Congress, state governors, agencies, organizations, and the public can all provide input on draft versions of five-year programs. BOEM received 15 comments on the 2017-2022 program. Members of Congress, state governors, agencies, organizations, and the public can submit comments on draft versions of five-year programs. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM received comments on the initial request for information, the DPP, and the PP. Some comments opposed certain regions in the program, while others supported lease sales or sought an expansion of lease areas. Public comments are considered in developing successive drafts of the program. After receiving comments on draft versions of the five-year program, BOEM considers public feedback for lease area expansion and sales. The agency may revise the program based on suggestions from Members of Congress and hold oversight hearings to evaluate it. The House held a hearing on the 2017-2022 program in April 2015, addressing issues like lease numbers. After BOEM released the DPP for 2017-2022, Congress held hearings to discuss lease sales in the Atlantic and Arctic, as well as seismic surveying. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee also discussed targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale from the program. Legislation may be used to direct specific terms for upcoming programs or modify existing ones. The 114th Congress considered legislation that would have affected the 2017-2022 program, including bills that were not enacted. H.R. 1487 and S. 791 would have required the use of an earlier-proposed draft program for oil and gas leasing. This program would have included 31 lease sales, with 3 excluded from the final program. The 114th Congress considered bills that would have impacted the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program. H.R. 1487 and S. 791 proposed using an earlier draft program with 31 lease sales, excluding 3 from the final program. The bills also required BOEM to conduct a sale in the Atlantic region and mandated lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest. Additionally, the bills approved the program under NEPA without further environmental review. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 and added lease sales to the program. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 and added lease sales for the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bristol Bay, Virginia, and other OCS areas with significant oil and gas reserves. The bill also included state revenue-sharing provisions and amendments to the OCSLA for leasing requirements. H.R. 3682 aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring BOEM to make at least 50% of available unleased acreage in key OCS planning areas available for leasing. It also set goals to increase oil and gas production by 2032 and allowed the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs. BOEM was mandated to finalize a leasing program for 2016-2021 in compliance with these provisions. The bill aimed to increase oil and gas production by 2032 and amend the OCSLA to allow the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs. It required BOEM to finalize a leasing program for 2016-2021 and conduct specific lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. Other provisions included revenue sharing with states, organization of DOI ocean energy agencies, and directing lease sales off North Carolina with military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states. The bill aimed to increase oil and gas production by 2032 and amend the OCSLA to allow the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs. It required BOEM to finalize a leasing program for 2016-2021 and conduct specific lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. The bill directed the Secretary to conduct a lease sale off North Carolina within two years of enactment, with subsequent annual lease sales in the following five years, along with military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states. The bills added Eastern Gulf lease sales to the 2017-2022 program and included state revenue-sharing and other offshore energy provisions. S. 1278 required lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea planning areas annually. It also mandated three lease sales in each of the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas in every five-year leasing program. Additionally, it required BOEM to extend existing leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas to 20 years if desired, with revenue sharing with Alaska. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on bills S. 1278, S. 1279, and S. 3203 on May 19, 2015. These bills proposed lease sales in various planning areas, including the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet areas, with provisions for revenue sharing, military operations, consultations with state governors, and geological surveys. S. 3203 specifically required two lease sales in each of the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas in a leasing program for FY2017 through FY2023. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 3203 on September 22, 2016. The bill proposed two lease sales in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas for FY2017 through FY2023, with increased revenue sharing with Alaska and changes to lease terms for the region. Congress has a 60-day review period for the final version of each five-year program under the OCSLA, during which they can introduce legislation to alter the program. During the 60-day review period for the five-year leasing program, Congress can introduce legislation to alter the program. For example, in the 112th Congress, Representative Doc Hastings introduced a bill to replace the submitted program with a congressionally developed plan. Similar bills were considered in the 114th Congress, and potential changes to the program could be discussed in the 115th Congress."
