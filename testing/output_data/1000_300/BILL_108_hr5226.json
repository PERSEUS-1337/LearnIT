    "content": "SECTION 1. CROP DISASTER ASSISTANCE. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"additional coverage,\" \"insurable commodity,\" and \"noninsurable commodity\" related to agricultural insurance. Emergency financial assistance is also mentioned, overriding a specific section of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to provide emergency financial assistance to producers who have suffered crop losses due to weather conditions in 2003 or 2004. The assistance will be administered similarly to the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001. The Secretary will provide assistance under this section similar to the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001. Producers on a farm are ineligible for assistance if they did not obtain insurance for the crop incurring losses. The Secretary may waive the requirement for producers to obtain insurance for crops incurring losses if they enter into a contract agreeing to obtain insurance. Producers on a farm must enter into a contract with the Secretary agreeing to obtain insurance for insurable commodities and file paperwork for noninsurable commodities for the next 2 crops. Violation of the contract requires the producer to reimburse the Secretary for the assistance provided. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7333) states that in case of a violation of a contract by a producer, they must reimburse the Secretary for the full assistance amount received. Payment limitations are in place, where assistance for crop losses cannot exceed 95% of the crop's estimated value without losses. This includes crop insurance payments. The Secretary estimates crop losses and includes crop insurance payments and remaining crop value in assistance calculations. Assistance under this section is reduced by aid received from Florida disaster programs for the same loss. The amount of assistance a producer receives under this section is reduced by the aid received from Florida Disaster Programs for the same loss. The Livestock Assistance Program is outlined in Section 2. The Livestock Assistance Program outlined in Section 2 includes emergency financial assistance for livestock losses in designated counties for either 2003 or 2004. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to administer payments, with a portion allocated for the American Indian livestock program. Assistance will be provided in a similar manner as outlined in previous legislation. The Secretary will provide assistance under the Livestock Assistance Program in a similar manner as outlined in previous legislation. Producers will not be penalized for reducing livestock numbers due to disaster conditions when determining eligibility for payments. The Tree Assistance Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide emergency assistance to producers who suffered tree losses between December 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. Additionally, an extra $15,000,000 will be used to reimburse eligible forest landowners who produce timber from trees for commercial purposes and experienced tree losses during the same period. The Secretary of Agriculture will allocate an additional $50,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation to assist participants in the Emergency Conservation Program. They will receive the maximum cost share percentage allowed under regulations. The Commodity Credit Corporation will be utilized to implement this Act. Regulations will be established accordingly. The Secretary of Agriculture may issue regulations to implement the Act without following certain procedural requirements. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted under section 808 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 7. OFFSET. Amends Section 1241(a)(3) of the Food Security Act of 1985 to allocate $6,037,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2014."
