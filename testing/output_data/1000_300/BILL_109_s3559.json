    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act of 2005\". It addresses fraud in connection with major disaster or emergency benefits. The \"Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act of 2005\" amends Chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code by adding a section on fraud in connection with major disaster or emergency benefits. It prohibits falsifying, concealing, or making false statements in matters involving benefits authorized in connection with a major disaster or emergency declaration. In cases involving benefits related to disaster declarations or emergency procurement with the United States, individuals may face fines, imprisonment up to 30 years, or both for fraudulent activities. The fraud must impact interstate or foreign commerce and may involve transportation through the mail. The section defines \"benefit\" as any valuable item provided by the government, and specifies that fraudulent activities related to disaster benefits or emergency procurement can result in fines and imprisonment for up to 30 years if they impact interstate commerce or involve mail transportation. SEC. 3 and SEC. 4 of the amendment increase criminal penalties for engaging in wire, radio, television, and mail fraud during and in relation to a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency. SEC. 4 amends Section 1341 of title 18, United States Code to increase criminal penalties for engaging in mail fraud during and in relation to a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency. The United States Sentencing Commission is required to increase penalties for fraud or theft offenses related to major disaster declarations and submit policy recommendations to Congress. The Sentencing Commission must ensure that sentencing guidelines reflect the seriousness of offenses and the need for law enforcement action. They should also maintain consistency with other directives, consider mitigating circumstances, and make necessary changes to guidelines. The Sentencing Commission must make necessary changes to sentencing guidelines, including exceptions and conforming adjustments, to ensure they meet the purposes of sentencing. The Commission has emergency authority to promulgate guidelines or amendments within 30 days of enactment, in accordance with specified procedures."
