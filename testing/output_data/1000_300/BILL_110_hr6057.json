    "content": "The \"Polar Bear Seas Protection Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to the protection of polar bear habitats. Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which support a variety of endangered species and are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures. The Arctic is undergoing dramatic changes due to climate change, affecting vital sea ice habitat for species like polar bears, walrus, and seals. The polar bear was proposed as a threatened species in 2007 due to projected loss of sea ice jeopardizing their survival. The Department of the Interior missed a legal deadline to decide on providing Endangered Species Act protections to polar bears due to the projected loss of sea ice habitat. Despite this, they moved forward with oil and gas leasing in an area that is polar bear habitat. The United States District Court Judge ruled that the Department of the Interior must decide on listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. Reports project a significant decline in polar bear population due to sea ice loss. The decline of Arctic sea ice is underestimated by current models, impacting the future status of polar bears. Global warming is a major threat, with potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas posing additional risks to marine life. Recovery of spilled oil in these harsh environments is challenging, and the leasing plan anticipates expansion in these areas. The Minerals Management Service's leasing plan anticipates offering 40 million acres in the Chukchi Sea and 33 million acres in the Beaufort Sea for oil and gas development, overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. A large oil spill during the broken-ice period could pose significant risks to the polar bear population and other marine mammals like whales and walruses. The agency warns that a large oil spill during the broken-ice period could harm the polar bear population and other marine mammals. Onshore industrial development for oil and gas can also damage important habitat and disturb denning polar bears and other wildlife. Tribal governments are concerned about the threats posed to subsistence resources and their culture. Tribal governments, including the Native Village of Point Hope and others, oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to prohibit leasing, preleasing, or any related activity in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The amendment to Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council, focusing on climate change impacts and supporting baseline information for oil and gas activities. The amendment to Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires reports on the adequacy of environmental studies in providing information on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. It also mandates a report to Congress identifying missing information and evaluating study adequacy. The amendment requires a report to Congress identifying missing information, evaluating ongoing studies, and making recommendations for additional research. The amendment requires the Secretary to perform an oil spill response gap analysis for proposed and existing arctic oil operations, setting a standard required of lessees to ensure at least 85% compliance. The amendment mandates consultation with stakeholders and sets a standard for lessees to recover 85% of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition. It must be demonstrated before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. The amendment requires consultation with stakeholders and sets a standard for lessees to recover 85% of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. It also implements procedures to close areas to oil and gas activity due to response gaps and establishes requirements for oil spill prevention systems. The amendment sets standards for oil spill prevention systems and operating restrictions to improve safety. It also requires implementing recommendations from the National Research Council report and ensuring that oil and gas activities in specific areas do not pose substantial risks to wildlife or subsistence. The amendment establishes standards for oil spill prevention systems and operating restrictions to enhance safety and prevent risks to wildlife and subsistence in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. It includes measures to identify and mitigate risks, as well as definitions for terms like 'response gap' and 'response gap analysis'. The amendment sets standards for oil spill prevention systems in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas, including a definition of 'response gap analysis' as assessing response system limits for various environmental factors. The amendment establishes standards for oil spill prevention systems in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas, including assessing response system limits for environmental factors through a response gap analysis. The amendment requires quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve oil spill recovery standards."
