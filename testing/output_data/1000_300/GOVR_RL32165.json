    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005, at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This fixed exchange rate prevented the yuan from fluctuating based on economic factors. Economists believe the peg was initially close to the market value but would have likely appreciated in the later years if left to float. The Chinese government modified its currency policy on July 21, 2005, allowing the yuan's exchange rate to be adjustable based on market supply and demand. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yuan was immediately adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, an appreciation of about 2.1%. The yuan would be allowed to fluctuate by 0.3% on a daily basis. The Chinese government implemented a managed float exchange rate policy in July 2005, allowing the yuan to appreciate slowly. Despite being partially convertible, China maintained tight controls over capital transactions. The yuan's movement is influenced by market forces but the government intervenes to slow its appreciation. China's foreign reserves grew rapidly, indicating that the yuan would appreciate more if allowed to freely float. China allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. The yuan has risen 16% against the dollar since the 2005 reforms, leading to concerns about the falling value of the dollar. Total U.S. exports are growing rapidly as a result. The falling value of the dollar has led to concerns about the U.S. economy, with fears of destabilization. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, China has been hesitant to make significant changes to their currency policy. This paper reviews the economic issues surrounding China's currency policy, including concerns raised by the U.S. and China's reluctance to change their fixed exchange rate regime. The economic concerns raised by the United States over China's currency policy and China's concerns over changing that policy, including how China's fixed exchange rate regime works and the U.S.-China trade imbalance. The economic consequences of China's currency policy for both countries, China's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, and policy options for the United States to induce China to reform its currency policy. Many U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives believe that China's currency is significantly undervalued, affecting trade between the two countries. Many U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives believe that China's significantly undervalued currency has led to a trade deficit with the U.S., hurting American production and employment in various sectors. Many analysts argue that China's currency policy affects other East Asian countries, leading them to intervene in currency markets to stay competitive. Groups are urging the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely. President Bush and officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. Initially, the Administration sought to encourage China to reform its financial system instead of applying direct pressure to abandon its currency peg. The Bush Administration initially rejected calls to pressure China to abandon its currency peg, instead encouraging financial system reform. By April 2005, there was a shift towards advocating for a more flexible exchange rate, driven by complaints from Members of Congress. The shift towards advocating for a more flexible exchange rate was driven by growing complaints from Members of Congress over China's currency policy. In April 2005, the Senate failed to reject an amendment imposing a tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. This led to negotiations for a vote on a similar bill sponsored by Senator Schumer. In 2006, supporters of S. 295 threatened to bring the bill up for a vote on two occasions but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Significant events regarding China's currency policy included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China from April 2007 to April 2008. In 2008, import prices from China increased 4.1%, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. U.S. imports from China rose by 1.8% in the first three months of 2008 compared to 2007. The Bank of China reported an exchange rate of 7.00 yuan to the dollar, appreciating by 15.9% since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion in March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was launched on September 29, 2007, with $200 billion in capital and invested $5 billion in Morgan Stanley on December 15, 2007. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was created with $200 billion to manage foreign exchange reserves. In response to rumors, China stated it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets. The government also eliminated regulations on converting foreign exchange holdings into yuan. The International Monetary Fund clarified currency manipulation policies in June 2007. The government eliminated regulations on converting foreign exchange holdings into yuan to discourage currency manipulation. In June 2007, the International Monetary Fund clarified currency manipulation policies. House Members filed a petition over China's currency practices, but the USTR's office declined it. The Treasury Department is required to report annually on foreign countries' exchange rate policies. The USTR's office declined a petition regarding a trade dispute brought to the WTO over China's currency manipulation practices. The Treasury Department is mandated to report annually on foreign countries' exchange rate policies, focusing on those with large global current account and trade surpluses with the US. Treasury has previously cited China for currency manipulation five times between 1992 and 1994. The Treasury Department has issued reports on international economic and exchange rate policies, focusing on major U.S. trading partners. China was cited for currency manipulation five times between 1992 and 1994 due to its dual exchange rate system and restrictions on foreign exchange access. Since China's currency reform in July 2005, the Treasury has increased its criticism of China's currency policy and reform pace. The November 28, 2005 report praised China's currency reforms but noted shortcomings in implementation. Since China reformed its currency in July 2005, Treasury has observed that China's new managed float exchange rate regime did not fully implement its commitment to increase the role of market forces in determining the yuan's value. Despite this, Treasury decided not to cite China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law. The Treasury Department decided not to label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, despite concerns about China's currency being undervalued and heavy intervention in currency markets. The decision was based on assurances from Chinese officials about market-determined currency flexibility and a focus on promoting domestic growth. Treasury continues to raise concerns about China's exchange rate regime with Chinese officials. The Treasury Department did not label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, despite concerns about China's undervalued currency and heavy intervention in currency markets. The report emphasized the need for China to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB's effective exchange rate to minimize risks for China and the global economy. Many Members criticized Treasury's decision not to cite China as a currency manipulator since 1994, calling for legislative changes in the criteria used for such determinations. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not aimed at boosting exports or limiting imports, but rather to maintain economic stability and investor confidence. They believe that abandoning the current currency peg to the dollar could lead to an economic crisis and harm their export industries during ongoing economic reforms. Many Members have proposed legislation to revise Treasury's criteria for determining currency manipulation or to estimate the yuan's misalignment against the dollar. Chinese officials are concerned that changing the currency policy could lead to an economic crisis, especially affecting export industries during ongoing reforms. They also worry about rural unrest due to income disparities and government corruption. Officials argue that appreciating the currency could harm farmers and the underdeveloped banking system may struggle to cope. Chinese officials are concerned that changing the currency policy could lead to an economic crisis, especially affecting export industries during ongoing reforms. They also worry about rural unrest due to income disparities and government corruption. Officials argue that appreciating the currency could harm farmers and the underdeveloped banking system may struggle to cope. Additionally, they believe that a convertible currency and poorly regulated financial system were factors in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. The severe negative economic impact in East Asian countries with floating currencies convinced officials that China's currency peg was a reason for its immunity to crisis. U.S. officials suggest China should reform its financial sector and make its currency more flexible. Fixed exchange rates have a history of use, including the Bretton Woods system. China's currency policy operated under a fixed exchange rate until July 2005, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system contrasts with a floating exchange rate, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate. Under a floating exchange rate system, the euro-dollar exchange rate fluctuates based on supply and demand in the marketplace. If the demand for Euro area goods or assets increases, the euro rises in value to restore equilibrium. The Chinese maintained a fixed exchange rate until 2005, but if they had a floating rate, their currency would likely have appreciated in recent years due to various factors like productivity. If the Chinese had a floating exchange rate, their currency would likely have appreciated in recent years due to factors like productivity and quality improvements, increasing the demand for Chinese goods and foreign direct investment. The central bank would need to adjust currency supply to match market demand, as shown in the balance of payments accounting identity. The current account balance is closely tied to the trade balance between the United States and China. Any increase in net exports or net private capital inflows leads to a corresponding increase in foreign exchange reserves to maintain the exchange rate peg. The Chinese central bank maintained the peg by buying dollars and holding U.S. financial securities instead of U.S. dollars. Since 2005, China has maintained a peg by increasing foreign reserves through buying dollars and holding U.S. financial securities. By 2007, foreign reserves grew to $1.53 trillion, with a $463 billion increase in 2006-2007. China's foreign reserves grew significantly from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. The yuan has appreciated by about 16% to 7 yuan per dollar by April 2008, following a managed float regime. China's neighbors also maintain managed floats or intervene in currency markets to keep their currency low against the dollar. China's foreign reserves have grown significantly from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. The yuan has appreciated by about 16% to 7 yuan per dollar by April 2008, following a managed float regime. China's neighbors also maintain managed floats or intervene in currency markets to keep their currency low against the dollar. The rapid accumulation of foreign reserves suggests that if the yuan were allowed to freely float, it would appreciate more rapidly. Preventing the yuan from appreciating against the dollar is not the only reason for China's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. China's foreign reserves have grown significantly in recent years, outpacing GDP and imports growth. The nature of China's reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets and the reasons for the increase, are not publicly disclosed. The real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate, influences economic activity. China's foreign reserves have grown significantly in recent years, outpacing GDP and imports growth. The real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate, influences economic activity. The difference between real and nominal exchange rates can impact exports and imports between countries. In 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, making exports progressively less expensive. The yuan has since appreciated, almost back to its 1998 level in real terms. Appreciation in the nominal exchange rate brings the yuan back to market value. If demand for Chinese goods increases, the floating yuan would appreciate until excess demand is exhausted. If the yuan were floating, it would appreciate with increased demand for Chinese goods. A fixed exchange rate leads to price adjustments over time. A fixed rate below market level results in a trade surplus with the US. The surplus equals capital flowing from China to the US, including purchases of US assets. The trade surplus with the United States persists due to the fixed exchange rate below market level, leading to capital flow from China. This capital includes purchases of US assets by private Chinese citizens and the accumulation of dollar reserves by the Chinese central bank. Increasing dollar reserves raises inflation in China, affecting export costs and imports. Eventually, as prices rise, the trade surplus will return to equilibrium. The fixed exchange rate undervaluation does not provide a permanent advantage. The undervaluation of a fixed exchange rate does not give a lasting competitive advantage to a country's exporters and import-competing industries. Floating exchange rates adjust more quickly to equilibrium values than fixed rates, limiting a country's ability to use monetary and fiscal policies to counteract economic changes. China's peg to the U.S. limits policy flexibility in the business cycle. A peg prevents interest rate adjustments to offset economic downturns, leading to capital outflows and pressure on the currency peg. This loss of autonomy is costly when tied to a partner with different business cycles, like the U.S. and China. China maintains some monetary autonomy through capital controls, unlike most countries with a fixed exchange rate. The currency is convertible for trade transactions but not for financial flows. Chinese enterprises must exchange foreign currency for yuan, and foreign exchange purchases are regulated, allowing China to retain some flexibility over interest rates. China's state bank requires individuals and firms to exchange foreign currency for yuan, regulating foreign exchange purchases. Despite a fixed exchange rate, China maintains monetary flexibility through capital controls. The undervaluation of the yuan has been widely discussed, but its appreciation remains uncertain. Estimates of the yuan's undervaluation have been cited in various sources, with two main methodological categories: the \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" method and the \"purchasing power parity\" method. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method is used to estimate misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method estimates misalignments in exchange rates by calculating how much the exchange rate must change to achieve a fundamental current account balance. This method is controversial as it assumes current account balances are misaligned and can be predictably adjusted. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. He observed that the increase in Chinese foreign exchange reserves equaled 100% of the Chinese trade surplus less net foreign direct investment in 2002. Preeg also noted a rule-of-thumb estimate that a 1% decline in the dollar leads to a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit. The yuan was estimated to be undervalued by 40% in 2003. A 1% decline in the dollar leads to a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit. The Chinese trade surplus plus net FDI flows equaled the increase in foreign exchange reserves. If the yuan floated, the surplus less FDI would be zero and the yuan would appreciate by 40%. The Institute for International Economics estimated the yuan to be 15%-25% undervalued in 2003. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003 and argues that the surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, resulting in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in equilibrium. The revaluation required to achieve this reduction is unusually large due to the extensive use of imports in the production of Chinese exports. Goldstein testified that estimates of yuan misalignment can be obtained by solving a trade model for RMB appreciation or by gauging the RMB appreciation to reduce global payment imbalances. Goldman Sachs estimated the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a 9.5%-15% revaluation could balance China's current account deficit. Coudert and Couharde's elasticity estimates show exports would fall 0.2% and imports would rise 0.5% with a 1% exchange rate increase. Goldstein testified that estimates of yuan misalignment can be obtained by solving a trade model for RMB appreciation or by gauging the RMB appreciation to reduce global payment imbalances. Coudert and Couharde's analysis suggests that a 9.5%-15% revaluation of the yuan could balance China's current account deficit, with exports falling 0.2% and imports rising 0.5% for every 1% increase in the exchange rate. They estimate China's underlying current account deficit to be between 1.5% and 2.8% of GDP, with the yuan being 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar in 2003. Estimates of yuan misalignment are based on simple assumptions rather than complex economic models. The main source of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance for China. There is no consensus on what this balance should be. The estimation of yuan misalignment is based on defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance for China, with no consensus on what this balance should be. The assumption of equilibrium is crucial, as changing it by 2 percentage points of GDP can significantly impact the estimated undervaluation. Some economists argue that the current account balance would always be close to zero in equilibrium, but this overlooks the fact that countries with different saving and investment rates may lend to and borrow from each other for extended periods. Some studies suggest that China's current account balance may not always be close to zero in equilibrium due to different saving and investment rates between countries. Estimates by Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs indicate a deficit in China's overall \"equilibrium\" current account position, influenced by foreign direct investment inflows. Choosing a deficit as the equilibrium benchmark leads to larger estimates of the yuan's undervaluation. If China were to use a fixed exchange rate as their equilibrium benchmark instead of a deficit, estimates of the yuan's undervaluation would be smaller. Capital controls limit portfolio flows currently, but requiring China to borrow from the world may not be sustainable. China must increase foreign reserves to prevent a rise in net foreign indebtedness. Determining the equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging due to capital controls. Maintaining capital controls after currency reform would complicate the current account balance. Determining the equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging due to capital controls. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may be reasonable. However, if capital controls are eliminated, the economic situation would change entirely, potentially leading to persistent borrowing or lending by private Chinese citizens and resulting in a trade deficit or surplus. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may be reasonable. However, if capital controls are eliminated, the economic situation would change entirely, potentially leading to persistent borrowing or lending by private Chinese citizens and resulting in a trade deficit or surplus. China's high internal saving rate may be sufficient to finance its investment, but it is unclear whether China would be a net borrower or lender if their currency floated and capital controls were abolished. Bosworth argues that China's high internal saving rate can finance its investment, offsetting FDI inflows with official outflows in foreign reserve accumulation. Wang suggests that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than actual, indicating an overvalued yuan. The FEER approach aims to reduce the unsustainable U.S. trade deficit by revaluing the yuan. The FEER approach argues that the yuan is overvalued, aiming to reduce the unsustainable U.S. trade deficit. It suggests that the dollar, yen, and euro are incorrectly valued as well. If trade and financial markets are rational, the trade deficit should not be unsustainable. There is no widely accepted theoretical approach to determining trade deficit sustainability. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is not widely agreed upon, with no clear theoretical approach to determine it. Evidence suggests that the trade deficit has not hindered economic growth in the past, and sudden declines in the dollar have not occurred. Even if the Chinese central bank reduced its trade deficit with the U.S., other foreign investors could still lend to the U.S., potentially offsetting any decrease in the overall trade deficit. The Chinese central bank reducing its trade deficit with the U.S. may not significantly impact the overall U.S. trade deficit. Other foreign investors could still lend to the U.S., potentially offsetting any decrease. It is uncertain if a \"fair share\" of the reduction in the U.S. trade deficit can be attributed to China, as countries have varying trade balances with different trading partners. Comparing to other East Asian countries, it is unclear what China's current account balance would be in equilibrium. The experience of East Asian countries in maintaining high saving rates and current account balances varies. Some countries ran deficits while others had surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, most countries have had large current account surpluses, indicating a challenging environment for developing world borrowing. Several countries in the region have significant foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. The current economic environment is not conducive to developing world borrowing, with several countries in the region having large foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. China's current account balance is in line with its neighbors, and estimates of the yuan's undervaluation based on purchasing power parity suggest a 56% undervaluation. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated China's currency undervaluation by 56% in February 2007. The index compares Big Mac prices in China and the US, but it has limitations as a guide to exchange rates due to non-tradeable factors like services. Li Ong suggests that most of a Big Mac's value comes from associated services, not the burger itself. The Big Mac Index compares prices of Big Macs in different locations to determine purchasing power parity, but it has limitations as most of the burger's value comes from non-tradeable services. This makes PPP unreliable in reality, as prices are lower in developing countries compared to industrialized ones. The purchasing power parity (PPP) theory, while powerful in theory, has proven to be unreliable in reality. Economists have attempted to estimate currency values using PPP, but caution is advised as it only predicts exchange rates over the long term. Additionally, PPP estimates may not change much over time, even with significant changes in trade deficits. The PPP approach for estimating currency values may not change much over time, even with significant trade deficit changes. Economists like Jeffrey Frankel and Coudert and Couharde have estimated China's undervaluation by 36% in 2000 and 41%-51% in 2003, respectively. However, there are caveats to this analysis as PPP only holds over the long run. The undervaluation of the yuan by 41%-51% is based on a PPP analysis, with caveats including the long-term nature of PPP, the need for gradual exchange rate adjustments, and the Balassa-Samuelson effect linking income levels to exchange rates. One rationale for linking income levels to exchange rate values is the \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect, where as countries get richer, their exchange rates are predicted to appreciate. Another proxy used is the ratio of the consumer price index to the producer price index. Studies have estimated the yuan to be undervalued by 18% to 47% in 2003 based on these proxies. The yuan was estimated to be undervalued by 18% to 47% in 2003 using proxies like the consumer price index to producer price index ratio. Different studies have shown varying degrees of undervaluation, with some cautioning about the accuracy of the price index proxy for China due to non-market determined consumer prices and restrictions on labor and capital mobility. Cheung et al. replicated these results but noted that they did not meet statistical inference standards. The undervaluation of the yuan in China may be affected by labor and capital restrictions. Cheung et al. found that previous estimates of undervaluation were not statistically significant, suggesting uncertainty. Adjusting for serial correlation and adding variables like trade openness led to smaller estimates of undervaluation. Changes in the model can greatly impact the estimated undervaluation. The addition of explanatory variables like trade openness in the PPP model reduces the estimated undervaluation. Changes in the model, such as altering the time period or excluding a country from the sample, can significantly affect the estimate. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates discusses using economic models to estimate currency misalignment, noting the variability in conclusions based on the variables used. Treasury Department emphasizes the importance of using economic models to estimate currency misalignment, focusing on serious misalignments using real effective exchange rates. It suggests using multiple models, supplementing judgments with empirical data, and considering market-based reasons for misalignment. Critics of China's currency peg often cite the U.S.-China trade imbalance. The Treasury Department suggests using economic models to estimate currency misalignment, focusing on serious misalignments using real effective exchange rates. Critics of China's currency peg often point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as proof of undervaluation. However, bilateral trade balances reflect structural causes and exchange rate effects. China had a small trade surplus with the world excluding the United States in 2007. China had a $256 billion merchandise trade surplus with the United States in 2007, with an overall trade surplus of $262 billion. Despite the undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar, China also runs trade deficits with other countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The rise in the U.S. trade deficit with China overlooks the fact that U.S. exports to China have been increasing significantly. In 2007, U.S. exports to China increased significantly, surpassing those to other major trading partners. China became the third largest U.S. export market, with a growing trade deficit attributed to export-oriented multinational companies moving production to China for low-cost labor. The share of China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) has risen dramatically over the years, reaching 57.1% in 2007. FIEs also account for a significant portion of China's imports, importing raw materials for assembly in China before exporting the final products. China tends to run trade deficits with East Asian countries and trade surpluses with countries like the United States due to this pattern. China's rising trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand nations like the United States are attributed to the country becoming a production platform for foreign companies. Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) play a significant role in China's trade, with FIEs accounting for a large share of exports and imports. This trend is closely linked to the rapid growth of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China. The rapid growth of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China led to a sharp rise in the share of China's trade by Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs). This increase in FDI, from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007, fueled export-oriented manufacturing, with a large portion of goods exported to the United States. Despite FIEs importing 80% as much as they export, they had little effect on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies shifted production to China from other East Asian countries, as shown in Table 6. China's trade balance is influenced by Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) importing 80% as much as they export. Foreign multinational companies have shifted production to China, with China becoming the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S. in 2007. U.S. imports of computer equipment from China rose significantly over seven years, while the total value of imports from the world only rose slightly. Imports of computer equipment from China to the U.S. have increased by 436% in the past seven years, while the total value of U.S. imports of these commodities has only risen by 26%. This growth in Chinese computer production is largely due to foreign companies moving their manufacturing facilities to China. The undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar has benefits and costs for both China and the U.S., making Chinese exports cheaper and attracting foreign investment in export-oriented production facilities. An undervalued currency in China benefits exporting firms but hurts non-exporting firms and consumers. It attracts foreign investment and technology transfers, but may impede resource allocation in the long run. A revaluation of the yuan could reduce aggregate spending in China. Chinese firms, especially those reliant on imported goods, may face challenges with an undervalued yuan. A revaluation could impact aggregate spending, with differing views on its effects on the economy. Some argue it could address overheating and prevent inflation, while others believe it could disrupt the absorption of underemployed labor. Critics note that China's currency policy limits the use of monetary tools for stable economic growth. China's currency policy is seen as economically and socially disruptive by many economists. It restricts the government's ability to use monetary policy for stable economic growth, leading to an overreliance on fixed investment and exports. This policy also raises concerns about the banking system's financial stability due to increased easy credit and non-performing loans. Additionally, it attracts speculative investments like real estate and stocks, contributing to the influx of \"hot money.\" The accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves by China may facilitate a quicker transition to a fully convertible currency, but it also comes with opportunity costs. Low interest rates in a booming economy hinder efficient capital allocation and could lead to overproduction in certain sectors. Additionally, the policy attracts \"hot money\" into speculative ventures like real estate and stocks, limiting the government's ability to use monetary policy for stable economic growth. The accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves by China may facilitate a quicker transition to a fully convertible currency. However, it also entails opportunity costs as these funds could be used for infrastructure improvements, education, social safety nets, and bank recapitalization. This accumulation can lead to a less expensive yuan, making Chinese exports to the US cheaper and US exports to China more expensive. The accumulation of foreign reserves by China leads to a cheaper yuan, impacting Chinese exports to the US and US exports to China. This results in a rise in the US trade deficit and a decrease in aggregate demand in the short run. China is a major supplier of labor-intensive consumer goods to the US, affecting domestic producers. China's exports to the United States include labor-intensive consumer goods like toys, textiles, apparel, shoes, and electronics. Some U.S. industries, such as machine tools, hardware, plastics, and furniture, are concerned about competition from China due to an undervalued currency. However, U.S. producers also import capital equipment and inputs from China, with computer firms being a significant importer of computer parts. China's exports to the United States include labor-intensive consumer goods like toys, textiles, apparel, shoes, and electronics. U.S. industries import capital equipment and inputs from China, with computer firms being a significant importer of computer parts. An undervalued yuan benefits U.S. products by lowering their prices and increasing competitiveness in global markets. The undervalued currency also affects U.S. borrowers and capital flows from China to the United States, allowing for more U.S. capital investment in plant and equipment. Capital inflow from China to the United States boosts U.S. capital investment in plant and equipment by lowering interest rates. This leads to increased aggregate spending in the short run and expands the economy in the long run. Household spending on consumer durables and housing also benefits from the lower interest rates caused by the capital inflow. The capital inflow from China to the United States boosts U.S. capital investment by lowering interest rates, leading to increased aggregate spending and expanding the economy. Chinese investment in U.S. Treasury securities helps fund federal budget deficits, but if the U.S. trade deficit with China were eliminated, the government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. An undervalued yuan allows the United States to increase consumption of goods through improved terms of trade, boosting purchasing power for U.S. consumers. This would lead to a decrease in capital inflow from China, potentially increasing U.S. government interest payments and budget deficit. The undervalued yuan increases U.S. consumers' purchasing power, impacting Chinese product prices in the U.S. Import prices from China rose by 4.1% in a year, leading to concerns about job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Critics argue that China's low yuan value has impacted the U.S. manufacturing sector, leading to job losses. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China, as manufacturing output has increased, and the trade deficit is growing overall. Long-term trends show a shift in U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector. The long-term trend in the U.S. is moving employment from manufacturing to the service sector due to changing technology and comparative advantage, leading to a decrease in the share of manufacturing jobs. This shift is driven by globalization and the production of knowledge- and technology-intensive goods in the U.S. for trade with countries like China, which excel in labor-intensive goods. Trade results in more manufacturing overseas and less in the U.S. The production of labor-intensive goods is shifting manufacturing abroad, away from the United States, due to trade with countries like China. Alan Greenspan stated that an undervalued yuan does not significantly impact manufacturing activity or jobs in the U.S. Instead, it leads to a shift in production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by China. An undervalued yuan does not affect aggregate demand in the United States but leads to a shift in production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by Chinese capital inflows. This shift does not have a significant impact on overall U.S. employment or unemployment rates. While the trade deficit with China has widened, the overall unemployment rate has decreased. However, the gains and losses in employment and production will not be evenly distributed across regions and sectors of the economy. The trade deficit with China has caused a shift in production towards firms benefiting from Chinese capital inflows. This shift may lead to temporary declines in aggregate spending and employment, with potential consequences on inflation rates. Uneven distribution of gains and losses in employment and production across regions and sectors is expected. A fall in aggregate spending due to the trade deficit with China may impact inflation rates. Government macroeconomic policy and market forces can offset output decline by boosting other elements of demand. Shifting U.S. output towards a higher capital base could lead to a larger economy in the long run. Chinese-owned capital in the U.S. may not benefit citizens directly, but workers using it could see higher productivity and wages. China accounts for a significant portion of U.S. imports, but only a fraction of the total trade deficit. The United States has a trade deficit with China, which has led to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment. This imbalance is due to low household and government saving rates, despite high rates of productivity growth and capital investment. China accounts for a significant portion of U.S. imports, but only a fraction of the total trade deficit. The United States has high rates of productivity growth and strong economic fundamentals conducive to capital investment, but low household and government saving rates. This leads to a trade deficit as foreigners finance profitable investments in the US. In contrast, China has a much higher saving rate compared to the US. China's gross national saving as a percent of GDP is significantly higher than the U.S., leading to a trade surplus for China and a trade deficit for the United States. China's higher rate of gross fixed investment and excess saving allow it to invest overseas, while the U.S. must borrow from abroad to fund its investment needs. This results in a current account balance of 9.0% for China compared to -6.2% for the United States. Both countries would need to make fundamental changes to their saving/investment patterns to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. China's higher gross national saving compared to the U.S. leads to a trade surplus for China and a trade deficit for the U.S. This is reflected in the current account balances as a percent of GDP, with China at 9.0% and the U.S. at -6.2%. Both countries would need to make significant changes to their saving/investment patterns to address the trade imbalance in the long run. Some analysts believe China is moving towards boosting consumer spending, while others argue that it will take time for China to shift its reliance on exports and domestic investment. China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth includes modernizing the financial sector. It will take time for China to shift from reliance on exports to consumption for GDP growth. Economists are more concerned with overall trade deficit than bilateral balances. The US has a trade deficit with some partners and a surplus with others due to comparative advantage. Low US saving rate makes it reliant on imports. The United States has a trade deficit with Austria and a trade surplus with the Netherlands, despite both countries using the euro. The US is heavily reliant on foreign financing for its investment opportunities, with a significant amount coming from China. The dollar has depreciated against various currencies, which could stimulate US exports and reduce demand for imports. Some economists fear a sudden plummet in the value of the dollar due to the unsustainably large trade deficit, which could cause severe dislocations for the U.S. economy. This adjustment may happen rapidly if investors realize significant dollar depreciation is inevitable and flee dollar assets. The dollar may shrink through further depreciation, causing concerns about sudden adjustment and dislocations in U.S. financial markets. Central banks in China and other developing countries have slowed the dollar's depreciation by accumulating foreign reserves. Central banks in China and other developing countries have accumulated foreign reserves to slow the depreciation of the dollar. This commitment to support the dollar's value may be why private investors feel secure investing in U.S. assets despite the large trade deficit. If these countries were to stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could significantly decline, potentially triggering a currency crisis. The United States could pressure China to reform its exchange rate policy by various means, such as making the yuan fully convertible, allowing gradual currency appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, widening the fluctuation band, and implementing financial sector reforms. This has sparked a policy debate on the best approach to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime. Options to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime, including proposed legislation, have sparked a lively policy debate. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator since 1994, believing that such a designation would increase pressure on China to reform its currency. Treasury is already negotiating with China to end such practices. The Treasury Department is already negotiating with China to end currency manipulation practices. Proposed legislation aims to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" and increase pressure on China to reform its currency. Some bills would require Treasury to cite a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent, potentially pushing China to boost reform efforts. The proposed legislation aims to increase pressure on China to reform its currency policy. The U.S. government could persuade China through direct negotiations to change its exchange rate policy. President Bush and Administration officials believe China's currency policy is detrimental to its economy and world growth. The U.S. has been assisting China in financial sector reform to support further currency reforms. The United States has been assisting China in financial sector reform to support further currency reforms and encourage policies to promote greater domestic consumption. China's currency policy has been a major topic in G-7 finance meetings, with the U.S. pressuring China to make the currency more flexible. The United States has been pressuring China to reform its currency policy in G-7 finance meetings, seeking to build consensus and potentially linking China's future G-7 membership to such reforms. Alternatively, the US could persuade China to engage in talks with other East Asian economies to reach a consensus on exchange rate policy. The United States could persuade China to participate in talks with other East Asian economies to reach a consensus on exchange rate policy. This approach aims to address concerns about China's impact on the competitiveness of other East Asian countries' exports. Additionally, the US could urge the International Monetary Fund to work with China on understanding the risks of over-relying on exports and domestic investment for growth, promoting policy tools for more balanced economic growth. The key in negotiations would be to convince China that liberalizing its exchange rate system aligns with its long-term economic interests. The U.S. government could pressure China to reform its exchange rate system by threatening trade sanctions or imposing tariffs on imports unless China appreciates its currency to fair market levels. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese imports to push for currency appreciation. Proponents believe that past threats have successfully influenced China to reform its currency policy and should be used again. Opponents argue against such measures. Some argue that threats of tariffs on Chinese goods have pushed China to reform its currency policy in the past and should be used again. Opponents fear sanctions would violate WTO rules and could backfire by reducing China's willingness to reform under political pressure. Proposed measures include denying certain countries access to U.S. government procurement and cutting off financing from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Some critics have charged that China's currency policy violates WTO rules. The United States could file a case before the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) against China's currency peg. If the DSB ruled in favor of the United States, it would direct China to modify its currency policy to comply with WTO rules. If China refused to comply, the DSB would likely authorize the United States to impose trade sanctions against China. The advantage of using the WTO is that it involves a multilateral approach, although there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the United States. The United States could use the WTO to address China's currency policy, potentially leading to trade sanctions. The advantage of the WTO is its multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the United States. If the US fails to use WTO procedures and imposes unilateral sanctions, China could file a WTO case. The Bush Administration rejected Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy in 2004, and in 2007, 42 House Members filed a petition over China's currency practices. The USTR declined the petition, expressing doubts about winning a case in the WTO. The Bush Administration rejected petitions on China's currency practices, expressing doubts about winning a WTO case. Legislation like H.R. 321 and S. 796 aim to address currency manipulation through the WTO. The Commerce Department pursued a countervailing case against Chinese products in 2006, imposing duties ranging from 11 to 20%. China is considered a non-market economy for U.S. trade laws, but economic reforms have made some sectors relatively market-oriented. The Commerce Department imposed countervailing duties (11 to 20%) on Chinese products. China, a non-market economy for U.S. trade laws, has some sectors that are market-based. Legislation like H.R. 782 and S. 796 aims to apply countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency manipulation. Critics argue it would be challenging to determine the impact. Several Members argue for legislation allowing countervailing duty procedures for currency misalignment or manipulation, citing the impact of China's undervalued yuan on U.S. industries. Critics raise concerns about determining subsidy levels and potential WTO challenges. Proposed bills like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 seek to factor in misaligned currencies when determining export prices. The impact of China's undervalued yuan on U.S. industries is a major factor affecting export prices. Proposed bills like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 aim to address this issue by factoring in misaligned currencies when determining antidumping duties. Critics question the feasibility of accurately assessing currency undervaluation and its compatibility with WTO rules. Other options include utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws related to China's WTO accession. The United States could use safeguard provisions to restrict Chinese imports causing market disruption. The Bush Administration invoked textile safeguards to limit Chinese exports until 2008. The Bush Administration used textile safeguards to limit Chinese exports until 2008. H.R. 782 and S. 796 propose considering China's exchange rate misalignment in determining market disruption under the safeguard. Some analysts caution against pressuring China too much on its currency policy, arguing it may not serve U.S. economic interests. Some analysts caution against pressuring China too much on its currency policy, arguing it may not serve U.S. economic interests. U.S. policymakers should address China's currency policy as part of a more comprehensive trade strategy to accelerate economic reforms and address U.S. complaints over trade practices. The Administration's policy in the SED talks includes urging China to boost domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible for a long-term solution to global trade imbalances. The immediate focus of U.S. trade policy should be on pressing China to comply with WTO commitments, including market access and protection of intellectual property rights. The immediate focus of U.S. trade policy should be on pressing China to comply with its WTO commitments, including market access and protection of intellectual property rights. Supporters argue that China is more likely to respond to international rules than direct U.S. pressure. China's leaders may be more responsive to international rules than direct U.S. pressure. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential for it to be used as a political tool. Recent reports suggest that China could make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries if pressured to revalue the yuan. This has sparked worry among U.S. policymakers. China could potentially collapse the dollar by selling off its U.S. Treasuries if pressured to revalue the yuan, sparking worry among U.S. policymakers. Senator Charles Grassley sought clarification from the Chinese government, which responded that they do not have plans to drastically adjust their foreign reserves. China's foreign exchange reserve investment portfolio includes dollar-denominated assets, but it is unlikely to liquidate a large portion of them. Such a move could lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, resulting in capital loss for China and lower value of its remaining U.S. assets. It could also increase the cost of exports to the United States and potentially reduce economic growth in the country. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage foreign exchange reserves, potentially diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities. This move could impact U.S. economic growth and demand for imports from China. China's state-owned funds may diversify away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities, potentially affecting U.S. interest rates. If the Chinese allow their currency to be market-driven, a stronger yuan could boost U.S. exports and reduce the trade deficit. However, this shift would require U.S. borrowers to find new lenders, leading to higher interest rates in the United States. If China stops purchasing U.S. assets to influence the exchange rate, U.S. borrowers will need new lenders, leading to higher interest rates. This could reduce spending on interest-sensitive purchases and potentially destabilize the U.S. economy. If China were to move to a floating exchange rate, it could potentially destabilize the U.S. economy by causing a drop in the value of the dollar. This could lead to inflationary pressures as import prices rise. China's current capital controls prevent a large private capital outflow, which is why they oppose a floating exchange rate. China opposes a floating exchange rate due to fears of large private capital outflow caused by unsafe deposits in state banks. This could lead to a depreciating exchange rate, reducing output of U.S. exporters and expanding the trade deficit. China may attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls temporarily. China could attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls, eliminating the possibility of currency depreciation due to private capital outflow. This may make imposing effective capital controls more challenging, as a fluctuating currency would incentivize evasion. Another option is to maintain the status quo, where the nominal exchange rate rises slowly, but the real rate adjusts over time as inflation rates diverge. The exchange rate may rise slowly over time as inflation rates diverge between countries. The central bank exchanging yuan for U.S. assets would lead to rising prices in China until the real exchange rate aligns with the market rate. This adjustment could reduce the U.S. trade deficit but may not eliminate it due to China's high saving rate and the U.S.'s low saving rate. Persistent imbalances in bilateral trade are not uncommon. China's high saving rate and the United States' low saving rate contribute to their trade balances being in surplus and deficit, respectively. Despite the significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005, China's exports to the U.S. continue to grow. The debate over China's currency policy is linked to concerns about the growing U.S. trade deficit, decline in manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. The current debate among U.S. policymakers over China's currency policy is strongly linked to concerns about the growing U.S. trade deficit with China and the impact on U.S. manufacturing employment. China's exchange rate has appreciated slowly since 2005, but the bilateral trade deficit has not fallen in response, suggesting other factors are at play. There is considerable debate over the potential effects of further yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy. The trade deficit with China has not prevented the United States from reaching full employment. It is unclear how much production has shifted to China from the United States compared to other low-wage countries. Foreign multinational corporations play a significant role in China's manufacturing sector. The debate over the extent of production shifting to China from the United States, compared to other low-wage countries, is complicated by the involvement of foreign multinational corporations in China's exports. The impact of an appreciating yuan on the U.S. trade deficit with China and concerns about the falling dollar are also significant factors in the discussion. China's accumulation of U.S. assets is affecting the value of the dollar, leading to debates on policy options to promote U.S. economic interests. Chinese officials plan to make the yuan more flexible in the short term and eventually adopt a floating currency. However, gradual reforms are preferred to avoid disruptions, such as implementing banking system reforms and reducing non-performing loans. The current currency policy may be expanding the money supply, undermining reform efforts. China's currency policy may be expanding the money supply, promoting easy credit policies by banks, and hindering efforts to reduce non-performing loans. The policy also acts as a de facto subsidy, benefiting some export industries while undermining others and preventing efficient resource distribution in the economy. Loans are extended to ventures with high returns. China's currency policy acts as a subsidy for some export industries but hinders resource distribution. US officials criticize China's cautious exchange rate reforms, which they believe are preventing global trade balance adjustments and could harm world economic growth. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms to boost domestic consumption and savings levels. China's economy relies heavily on exports. China and U.S. officials agree on the need for major economic reforms. China plans to boost economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, healthcare, and education. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address China's currency policy through tariffs and WTO cases. The bill H.R. 782/S. 796 aims to impose additional tariffs on Chinese products if currency manipulation is determined. It also calls for filing a WTO case against China over its currency policy and modifying rules on currency manipulation within the WTO. The bills apply U.S. countervailing laws to products from non-market economies like China and establish a methodology for estimating government subsidy benefits. Exchange rate misalignment would be actionable under U.S. countervailing law, and the Treasury Department would determine misaligned currencies in semi-annual reports to Congress. The bills aim to address currency manipulation by China through various measures, including imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods, making exchange rate misalignment actionable under U.S. countervailing law, and prohibiting the Department of Defense from purchasing certain products from China if currency misalignment disrupts U.S. defense industries. H.R. 1002 would impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless China stops manipulating its currency, while H.R. 2942 would apply countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and consider undervalued currency in determining antidumping and countervailing duties. The President certifies that China is no longer manipulating its currency. H.R. 2942 would apply countervailing laws to nonmarket economies, consider undervalued currency in determining antidumping and countervailing duties, and require Treasury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies for priority action. S. 364 would apply U.S. countervailing laws on non-market economies and make exchange rate manipulation actionable under such laws. S. 1607 would require the Treasury Department to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies for priority action in its semi-annual reports to Congress on exchange rates. If consultations fail to resolve currency issues, the USTR would be required to take action in the WTO. The U.S. would take action against countries with fundamentally misaligned currencies, including imposing antidumping duties, banning federal procurement, and opposing multilateral financing. If necessary, the USTR would file a case in the WTO and the Treasury Department could intervene in international currency markets. A modified bill passed the Senate Finance Committee in 2007. The USTR would file a case in the WTO, and the Treasury Department could intervene in international currency markets. Senate Finance Committee passed a modified bill in 2007 requiring Treasury to identify currency manipulators and submit action plans. Several bills introduced in the 109th Congress address currency manipulation. In the 109th Congress, several bills were introduced to address foreign exchange rate policies. One bill proposed a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. Despite a failed Senate vote, a similar bill was scheduled for a vote later in the year. In the 109th Congress, a vote on S. 295 (similar to S.Amdt. 309) was scheduled for July 27, 2005, but was delayed after Senator Schumer learned about expected currency reforms in China. Despite disappointment over China's currency reforms in July 2005, the bill was considered for a vote by November 16, 2005. Senators Schumer and Graham later decided to delay the bill further based on their assessment of China's seriousness in reforming its currency policy. In the 109th Congress, Senators Schumer and Graham delayed the vote on S. 295 multiple times due to their assessment of China's currency policy. Despite initial optimism, Senator Schumer expressed disappointment with China's lack of progress on currency flexibility. President Bush convinced them not to pursue a vote to allow more time for negotiations with China. H.R. 3283 (English) aimed to apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and required the Treasury Department to define \"currency manipulation.\" H.R. 3283 (English) would apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and require the Treasury Department to define \"currency manipulation.\" The bill passed on July 27, 2005, with a similar bill introduced in the Senate, S. 1421 (Collins)."
