    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act.\" It aims to facilitate access to speedy transmissions for networks, e-commerce, and telecommunications. Congress finds that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets nationwide. The Act recognizes the unique abilities of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, who are positioned to accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less densely populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines will accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives in less densely populated regions, benefiting consumers. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. This will benefit consumers in all regions, especially in less densely populated areas. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources to increase investment in initiatives and improve flexibility. SEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\nSection 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines.\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATORY RELIEF FOR TWO PERCENT CARRIERS.\n\nTitle II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to provide regulatory relief for these carriers. SEC. 4. REGULATORY RELIEF FOR TWO PERCENT CARRIERS. Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to provide reduced regulatory requirements for two percent carriers. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced against two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. This does not apply if the rules adopted do not pertain to two percent carriers. The Commission is not required to conduct a separate evaluation if rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Differentiation based on carrier size is allowed by law. These provisions apply to rules adopted after the enactment of this section. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224 compliance. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services or maintain separate operations. SEC. 284 addresses participation in tariff pools and price cap regulation. The text discusses the participation of a two percent carrier in a common line tariff administered by NECA or price cap regulation by the Commission for study areas. The carrier can choose to participate or withdraw from the tariff for specific study areas with a 60-day notice requirement, and the election is binding for one year. A two percent carrier may elect to be regulated by the Commission under price cap rate regulation for specific study areas, with the election binding for one year from the date of the election. The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for rate structures. This includes services not previously offered that expand options for customers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under specific regulations. Two percent carriers can adjust their interstate rates quickly and file contract-based tariffs with one day's notice upon certifying competition in their service area. This pricing flexibility allows carriers to compute their interstate rate of return based on the nondiscounted rate for the service. The Commission will regulate a two percent carrier as non-dominant and not require tariffing of their interstate service offerings if they certify competition in their service area. Additionally, the carrier can participate in the common line tariff if they meet certain requirements. A two percent carrier meeting certain requirements can participate in the common line tariff by including its study areas. Definitions for facilities-based entry and contract-based tariff are provided. The term 'contract-based tariff' refers to a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and its customers, outlining the contract terms, services provided, volume commitments, and prices. The term 'contract-based tariff' refers to a tariff based on a service contract between a carrier and its customers, detailing volume commitments, prices, volume discounts, and other regulations affecting the contract rate. SEC. 287 of the Act provides savings provisions regarding the authority of the Commission, rights of rural telephone companies, and state authority. SEC. 5 imposes limitations on merger review. Amendment to Section 310 of the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline of 60 days for the Commission to make public interest determinations for mergers involving two percent carriers.

Additionally, two percent carriers are allowed to make an election regarding local exchange facilities acquired through a merger or acquisition subject to the review deadline. The amendment to Section 310 of the Communications Act of 1934 establishes a 60-day deadline for the Commission to make public interest determinations for mergers involving two percent carriers. Two percent carriers can elect regarding local exchange facilities acquired through a merger or acquisition subject to the review deadline. The provisions apply to applications submitted after the enactment date, and pending applications are subject to the new requirements. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being deemed granted. The Commission must issue an order on petitions within 90 days, failure to do so results in relief being granted. Any order issued is final and can be appealed. The Commission must issue an order on petitions within 90 days, failure to do so results in relief being granted. Any order issued is final and can be appealed. The provisions of this section apply to petitions for reconsideration or waiver submitted after the enactment date. Petitions pending on the enactment date are subject to these requirements as if filed on that date. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS.\n\nExceptions to the 60-day and 90-day time periods under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 can be made if an Executive Branch agency with national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns advises the FCC in writing."
