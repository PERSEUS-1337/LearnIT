FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds the need to increase the number of high school students prepared for STEM education, emphasizing the importance of hands-on laboratory experiences in science programs.\" The National Research Council found that the quality of laboratory experiences in high schools is poor for most students, with disagreement among educators and researchers on defining labs' purpose. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate lab facilities. The Government Accountability Office reported that schools with a majority minority student population often do not meet functional requirements for laboratory science. Research shows that schools with a high minority student population often lack proper laboratory facilities, leading to issues in meeting functional requirements for laboratory science. Additionally, college students who left the science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including a lack of laboratory experience and exposure to theoretical or analytical modes of thought. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in projects to enhance the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The grant program aims to enhance the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' under a grant program to enhance teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The Director will establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants can be used for purchasing equipment and scientific educational materials. The pilot program 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' awards grants for improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants may be used for purchasing, rental, or leasing of equipment, maintenance, renovation, improvement of laboratory facilities, professional development for teachers, and development of instructional programs integrating laboratory experience with classroom instruction. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of training in laboratory safety for school personnel and designing hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in math, science, engineering, and technology among students. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act aims to support individuals in math, science, engineering, and technology fields for postsecondary studies through funded activities and partnerships with higher education institutions or community colleges. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act supports partnerships for postsecondary studies involving higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of grant-funded activities should not exceed a certain cost. The Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act limits the Federal share of grant-funded activities to 50 percent for community-based organizations. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate the effectiveness of pilot projects funded by the grant program in improving student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation results, including best practices and materials developed by grant awardees, must be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees within 5 years. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act and its amendments includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
