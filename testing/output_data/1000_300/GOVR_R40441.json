The Navy's environmental assessment concluded minimal harm to marine mammals. Petitioners sought relief, and the district court initially granted an injunction. The Navy scheduled training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar. Environmentalists claimed harm to whales, leading to litigation. The district court initially granted a preliminary injunction barring conduct of the exercises. On remand, the court modified the injunction to allow the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, citing a \"possibility\" of irreparable injury and favoring the plaintiffs in the balance of hardships. The Supreme Court ruled in November 2008, finding the Ninth Circuit's \"possibility\" test for injunction issuance too stringent. The Supreme Court ruled in November 12, 2008 that the Ninth Circuit's \"possibility\" test for preliminary injunctions was too lenient. The majority opinion, by conservative justices, stated that plaintiffs must show that irreparable injury is \"likely\" in the absence of an injunction. The Court found that the Navy's interest in effective training outweighed the potential harm to marine mammals, leading to the reversal of the decision below and vacating the preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, citing national security interests in Navy training exercises. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding potential violations of environmental laws. The Supreme Court reversed a decision and vacated a preliminary injunction due to national security interests in Navy training exercises. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding potential environmental law violations. On June 4, 2003, the Forest Service issued regulations under the ARA that limited public input and appeals for projects covered by categorical exclusions. A timber sale project was approved under these regulations, leading to a legal challenge and a nationwide injunction against the regulations. The Ninth Circuit invalidated 2003 regulations limiting public input and appeals for a timber sale project on post-fire forest land. Plaintiffs had standing due to procedural rights deprivation and reduced recreational enjoyment. The court found the appeal prohibition ripe and ruled that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA. The Ninth Circuit invalidated 2003 regulations limiting public input and appeals for a timber sale project on post-fire forest land. The court found that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA and affirmed the nationwide scope of the district court's injunction against the regulations' enforcement. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address questions regarding the Forest Service's promulgation of the regulations and the standing of environmental groups. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether the subject of judicial review in a timber sale case is valid, if environmental groups have standing, if challenges to specific regulations are still relevant after the sale was withdrawn, and if the Ninth Circuit was correct in affirming a nationwide injunction. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for broader reform, making the outcome significant. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, with the Supreme Court potentially ruling against nationwide remedies. The case involves industrial water intake structures harming aquatic organisms. The Clean Water Act requires cooling water intake structures at power plants to use the best technology available to minimize harm to aquatic organisms. In 2004, the EPA issued a rule allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology. In a 2007 case, the Second Circuit invalidated this approach. EPA issued a rule for cooling water intake structures at power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology. In Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. EPA can consider cost in other ways, such as determining industry affordability and conducting cost effectiveness analysis for BTA selection. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008, to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for cooling water intake structures. In the 1970s, there was resistance to cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws. In the 1970s, federal environmental laws faced resistance to cost-benefit analysis. Recently, there has been a shift towards greater acceptance of this analysis. The Supreme Court case will test if conservative justices will continue this shift, potentially legitimizing cost-benefit analysis in the Clean Water Act and other pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation and costs are also under scrutiny. The case involves Coeur Alaska proposing to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest, with plans to dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake, causing significant harm to aquatic life. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation and costs are also being scrutinized in this context. The Coeur Alaska gold mine planned to dispose of 210,000 gallons of wastewater daily, containing 1,440 tons of tailings, into a nearby lake, which would kill all aquatic life and raise the lake bottom by 50 feet. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, but conflicting regulations led to a legal challenge in Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The court ruled that Coeur Alaska's gold mine discharge must comply with EPA's new source performance standard under the Clean Water Act, despite having a 404 permit. The CWA requires the performance standard to be incorporated into the mill's NPDES permit, with no implied exemption under Section 404. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act requires Coeur Alaska's gold mine discharge to comply with EPA's new source performance standard through an NPDES permit, despite having a 404 permit. The court found that there is no implied exemption under Section 404 for waste products subject to performance standards to be regulated as fill material. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to EPA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008, to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to EPA under the Clean Water Act. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The consequences of a potential reversal could be significant, as it may give the Corps wide latitude to remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" EPA and California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. The state of California spent a significant amount on cleaning up toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical storage facility. EPA and the state sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA, holding past and present owners and operators liable. The defendants included the defunct facility operator, two railroads, and Shell Oil Co. The district court found the railroads liable. The district court found two railroads and Shell Oil Co. liable for a percentage of total cleanup costs at a contaminated site. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the apportionment of cleanup costs among the defendants. The court addressed the liability of railroads and Shell for cleanup costs at a contaminated site. The court ruled that apportionment of costs is possible but neither party provided a reasonable basis for it. Additionally, the court discussed the broader definition of \"arranger\" liability under CERCLA case law. The court ruled on Shell's liability as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA case law, stating that arranger liability is not limited to direct disposal transactions. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of responsibility and the standard of review. The Ninth Circuit erred in reversing the district court's apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA and adopting a standard of review that conflicts with common law principles. The case questions whether liability for arranging disposal of hazardous substances can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells a product that later causes contamination, and if joint and several liability can be imposed on multiple parties even when divisibility is reasonable. This case raises significant Superfund Act issues that the Court has previously denied certiorari on. The case questions liability under CERCLA for arranging disposal of hazardous substances and joint and several liability for multiple parties even with reasonable divisibility. It raises significant Superfund Act issues that the Court has previously denied certiorari on. The heart of the Superfund statute is its expansive liability scheme designed to ensure solvent responsible parties reimburse the government for cleanup costs. The Supreme Court case questions liability under CERCLA for arranging disposal of hazardous substances and joint and several liability for multiple parties. The legislative history shows that parties made liable under the act are jointly and severally liable unless there is a reasonable basis for apportioning liability. Burlington Northern's impact on defining a reasonable basis could affect the government's ability to recover costs. A lax standard could lead to the federal treasury absorbing more cleanup costs, while a tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability could reduce potential defendants, increasing the likelihood of the treasury covering some costs. The Supreme Court case questions liability under CERCLA for arranging disposal of hazardous substances and joint and several liability for multiple parties. A tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability could reduce potential defendants, increasing the likelihood of the treasury covering some costs. The cases accepted by the Supreme Court are important for their individual programs and may reveal the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. Industry views these cases with optimism. The Supreme Court cases accepted are important for their individual programs and may reveal the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. Industry views these cases with optimism, while the environmental community is apprehensive. The environmental side won in the decision below in all five cases, suggesting potential reversals in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court cases accepted are significant for their programs and may indicate the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. The environmental community is concerned as the Court has a high reversal rate in the Ninth Circuit and has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases. The current Supreme Court is less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns compared to previous decades. The increase in environmental cases this term could be due to random selection or conservative justices anticipating future appointments. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random selection, conservative justices anticipating future appointments, or eminent Supreme Court practitioners showing interest. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, with the majority of petitions for certiorari being turned down. The justices' continuity from previous decisions may play a role in the rejection of certain cases. The Supreme Court continues to reject petitions for certiorari, including cases related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The nonacceptance of cases like Rapanos may be due to the same justices on the Court since 2006, leading to confusion in lower courts regarding the rule of law."
