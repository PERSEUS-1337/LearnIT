    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has allowed Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges, resulting in benefits such as paying only for success, setting ambitious goals without predicting success, involving a broader group of people, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has enabled Federal agencies to utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science, granting them direct authority to do so. This allows for the removal of ambiguity, encourages appropriate use, and stimulates broader public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits, including improving government service delivery with lower resource investments. Citizen science offers benefits such as improving government service delivery, connecting citizens to federal agency missions, acquiring data at a greater extent, and enabling citizens to address community concerns through data gathering and sharing. Citizen science enables citizens to address community concerns by gathering, analyzing, and sharing data. It also accelerates scientific research, improves science literacy, furthers science diplomacy, and builds trust between citizens and scientists. Citizen science fosters worldwide collaboration between scientists and citizens, building trust and understanding. Participants engage for various reasons, such as receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving problems. Citizen science participants engage in learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving problems for the benefit of society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" refers to open collaboration in the scientific process, including formulating research questions, conducting experiments, and making discoveries. \"Crowdsourcing\" is a method to obtain services or content by soliciting contributions from a group, especially online. In this section, \"crowdsourcing\" is defined as obtaining services or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from a group, especially online. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" excludes legislative branch agencies. A \"participant\" is defined as any individual involved in the process. The term \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, and detailees of a Federal agency. The head of each Federal agency or multiple agencies working together may authorize crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. The head of a Federal agency or multiple agencies working together may utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches to advance their mission. Voluntary services from participants can be accepted for authorized projects under this section. Personnel Management, voluntary services from participants under this section must be part of authorized projects, uncompensated, and not displace federal employees. Federal agencies must advertise and promote projects for broad participation, determine consent levels, and registration terms. Each Federal agency can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment required from participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. The agency must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms of use clearly to participants. Federal agencies can obtain consent electronically or in written form from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations, and agencies should prioritize data security and privacy. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must comply with regulations outlined in part 46 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations. They are required to make data collected from these projects open and available to the public in machine-readable formats. Participants must be informed about the expected uses of the data, ownership rights, availability for public use, and authorization to publish the data. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must comply with regulations to make data and results available to the public. Participants must agree to assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government. Technologies and applications developed through these projects should be open and accessible to the public. Citizen science projects must agree to assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct. Federal agencies must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity policies. In crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, Federal agencies can form partnerships with private or public entities for administrative duties and may use appropriated funds for funding. In carrying out crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, Federal agencies can use funds appropriated by Congress and accept funds or in-kind support from other Federal agencies, private sector entities, government agencies, and public institutions of higher education without giving special consideration in return. The General Services Administration will provide assistance to develop products and services for crowdsourcing and citizen science activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Federal agencies will follow OSTP guidance for implementing these activities. The Federal agencies will carry out activities to further the policy objectives of the Federal Government. The heads of each agency engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science are encouraged to consult OSTP guidance. The Director will report on these activities every 2 years after the Act's enactment. Each report will include a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies, including goals, participation rates, and project descriptions. The Director will report on participation rates, resources used, and project descriptions for crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies. The Director will report on how resources were allocated among Federal agency accounts for crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, including descriptions of project advancements, results, data quality methods, and any savings or costs incurred by the Government. The report will include details on resource allocation for crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, project advancements, results, data quality methods, savings or costs incurred by the Government, challenges faced by Federal agencies, steps taken to address challenges, and recommendations for future action. The report will also cover the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods by Federal agencies, including partnerships, and any other relevant information deemed important by the Director.
