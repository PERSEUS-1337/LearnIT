Static and dynamic analysis are commonly used approaches in Android malware detection. In Android malware detection, static analysis involves collecting permissions by unpacking or disassembling the app, while dynamic analysis looks at runtime execution characteristics. Commercial systems often use a combination of both approaches. Static analysis is preferred in Android devices for its advantages like low computational cost and resource utilization, while dynamic analysis can detect metamorphic and polymorphic malwares. Traditional machine learning classifiers have been evaluated for android malware detection using permissions, API calls, and a combination of both.

Artificial neural networks represent a directed graph of interconnected artificial neurons. The section discusses the concepts of deep neural networks (DNNs) architecture and promising techniques for training DNNs. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are represented as a directed graph with interconnected artificial neurons, influenced by biological neural networks. A feed forward network (FFN) is a simple type of ANNs, with a subset called multi-layer perceptron (MLP) consisting of input, hidden, and output layers. Increasing the number of hidden layers is possible for complex data. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a subset of feed forward networks (FFN) with 3 or more layers of artificial neurons. The number of hidden layers can be increased for complex data, forming an acyclic graph that passes information forward. MLP can be represented as O: Rp \u00d7 Rq, with hidden layer computation mathematically formulated.ReLU units have been effective in MLP networks with multiple hidden layers. The hidden layers in a neural network can be defined mathematically. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are efficient for training with large datasets, speeding up the process compared to traditional activation functions. TensorFlow and Keras are used as software frameworks for deep learning architectures.

Unified Threat Management is a real-time system for UniteCloud server in New Zealand, with log files containing operational measurements from 9 sensors. The dataset for Fraud Detection was anonymized using a rule-based approach, and experiments were conducted to find the optimal learning rate, with the highest accuracy achieved at 0.1. The experiments involved testing different learning rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 over 500 epochs. The highest accuracy of 10-fold cross validation was achieved at a learning rate of 0.1, with fluctuations in accuracy observed at rates of 0.2, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.5. Despite considering more complex architectures, a learning rate of 0.1 was chosen for subsequent experiments to balance performance, training time, and computational cost.
