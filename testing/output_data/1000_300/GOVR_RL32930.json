    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, establishes the framework for labor-management relations in the private sector. It aims to improve workers' bargaining power and eliminate obstacles to commerce by encouraging collective bargaining. Workers have the right to join unions and negotiate wages, hours, and working conditions. The NLRA allows workers to join unions, bargain collectively, and protects their rights. It requires employers to negotiate in good faith with chosen unions and defines unfair labor practices. The act does not apply to certain industries or exclude unauthorized workers from engaging in union activities. The NLRB enforces the NLRA independently. The NLRA allows various types of workers to engage in union activities, including unauthorized workers. The NLRB, an independent federal agency, administers and enforces the NLRA through a five-member board and General Counsel. The board resolves election disputes, determines bargaining unit composition, and handles unfair labor practice appeals. Bargaining units are groups of employees represented by a union based on shared interests. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union based on shared interests in wages, hours, and working conditions. The composition of a bargaining unit can include employees of one employer, establishment, or occupation. Guards cannot be included in the same bargaining unit as other employees, and the appropriate unit is determined by agreement between the union and employer or by the NLRB. In August 2011, the NLRB reviewed a case where CNAs at a healthcare center in Mobile, AL, petitioned to be represented by the USW. The employer argued that the bargaining unit should include all nonprofessional service and maintenance employees, not just CNAs. The CNAs assist residents with daily tasks and help move them within the facility. The CNAs at the healthcare center in Mobile, AL assist residents with daily tasks, move them within the facility, and wear nursing uniforms. They work one of three eight-hour shifts and must maintain certification from the state of Alabama. The employer argued that other employees like resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, and a maintenance assistant should be included in the bargaining unit. The board voted in favor (3-1) of including CNAs in the bargaining unit, along with other employees like resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks. These employees have similar educational requirements as CNAs and receive similar benefits. Unlike CNAs, they are not part of the nursing department and do not work one of three eight-hour shifts. The board voted (3-1) in favor of including CNAs in the bargaining unit, agreeing that they shared a community of interest due to distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. Rules for union organizing campaigns differ for employers, employees, and union organizers, including soliciting union support and distributing union literature. Rules for union organizing campaigns differ for employers, employees, and union organizers. Employers may campaign against unionization, hold captive audience meetings, and provide written information to employees. Employees can campaign for union support during work hours in various areas. Exceptions to basic rules may apply in specific organizing campaigns. Employees can campaign for union support from coworkers during work hours in both work and nonwork areas. Distribution of union literature is allowed in nonwork areas if not permitted in work areas. Using employer's e-mail for union activities may be restricted, depending on the employer's policy on using work e-mail for other causes or organizations. Employees can engage in union activities such as organizing and bargaining, using their work e-mail for soliciting support for causes or organizations if allowed by the employer. Union organizers may not campaign on company property but can distribute literature in nonwork areas. Nonemployee union organizers may be permitted in inaccessible workplaces or with employer permission. Organizers can meet with employees on union property, solicit support on public property, and contact employees at home by phone or mail. The NLRA allows nonemployees to solicit on company property, meet with employees on union property, hand out literature on public property, contact employees at home, and visit employees at home. Employers cannot interfere with employees' rights to form or join a union, threaten job loss or benefits for union support, or use wage increases to discourage unionization. Employees have the right to form or join a union without fear of employer retaliation. Employers cannot threaten job loss, close plants, or discriminate against union activities. Both employers and unions must bargain in good faith regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. Unions cannot coerce employees to join or not join, or threaten job loss for lack of support. A union cannot coerce employees to join or not join, threaten job loss, or discriminate against employees. Unfair labor practices can be filed by employees, employers, or unions. The NLRB investigates and may seek a voluntary settlement or hold a hearing if a violation is found. The NLRA aims to prevent and address unfair labor practices. If a violation is found, the regional director seeks a voluntary settlement, or the case goes to an NLRB administrative law judge. The act allows for cease-and-desist orders and remedies for violations. Employers may have to reinstate fired employees with back pay for union activities, while unions may be responsible for back pay if they cause a worker to be fired. In FY2011, $60.5 million was allocated for these purposes. If an employer improperly fires an employee for engaging in union activities, they may be required to reinstate the employee with back pay. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay was awarded for workers fired or discriminated against for union activities. Estimates suggest 1,000 to 3,000 workers are illegally fired for union activities annually. Kate Bronfenbrenner found that workers are fired for union activities in 25% of union campaigns. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY2012. In 1998 and 1999, Kate Bronfenbrenner found that 25% of union campaigns resulted in workers being fired for union activities. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and stood at 21,629 in FY2012, with 36.4% found to have merit. The NLRA states that a union may be designated for collective bargaining by a majority of employees through elections or signed authorization cards. The NLRA allows for a union to be certified through a secret ballot election or recognized by an employer before collective bargaining can begin. The NLRB may order an employer to recognize and bargain with a union if unfair labor practices have occurred. A union can also be voluntarily recognized by an employer if a majority of employees in a bargaining unit have signed authorization cards. Certification through a secret ballot election offers advantages over employer recognition without an election. The NLRB conducts elections upon petition from a union, worker, or employer. A petition can be filed if 30% of employees sign authorization cards. An employer can request an election if a union claims majority representation and seeks to bargain. If a majority of employees vote for union representation in an NLRB election, the union is certified as the bargaining representative. The NLRA does not specify a timeline for elections. When employees in a bargaining unit choose a union through an NLRB election, the union is certified as their bargaining representative. The NLRA does not set a specific timeline for elections. Certification does not require an initial contract agreement between the union and employer. If no agreement is reached on the election details, a hearing may be held at the NLRB regional office, and the regional director may order an election. Employees in a secret ballot election decide on union representation. If multiple unions are on the ballot and no choice gets a majority vote, further steps may be taken. The regional director may order an election, which can be appealed to the board. In a secret ballot election, employees choose union representation. If no union receives a majority, a runoff election is held. Challenges to voting rights can be made by the employer or union. Objections to the election can be filed, with decisions appealable to the board. Alternatively, a third party can conduct a secret ballot election. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for decertification of unions. A decertification petition must be signed by at least 30% of employees in the bargaining unit. A union certified after a secret ballot election is protected from decertification for a year. In June 2011, the NLRB published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. After winning a secret ballot election, a certified union is protected for a year from decertification and election petitions by another union. The NLRB proposed changes to union representation procedures in June 2011, with a final rule issued on December 22, 2011. Implementation was suspended in response to a court decision in May 2012. The NLRB proposed changes to union representation procedures in December 2011, allowing hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to relevant matters. Implementation was suspended in May 2012 due to a court decision. The NLRB proposed changes to union representation procedures in December 2011, allowing hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to relevant matters. Currently, pre- and post-election requests for review are filed before and after the election respectively. Under the new rule, both types of requests will be filed after the election. The final rule only allows special permission for review of pre-election rulings in extraordinary circumstances. The NLRB proposed changes to union representation procedures in December 2011, allowing hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to relevant matters. Currently, pre- and post-election requests for review are filed before and after the election respectively. The December 22, 2011 rule eliminated the 25-day waiting period for board review of pre-election decisions, making it discretionary. In FY2010, the NLRB conducted 1,823 secret ballot elections, with unions winning 62.3% of them. Most elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the employer and union. The NLRA does not specify a timeline for elections, but they are typically held within two months of petition filing. In FY2011, post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases. For objections resulting in an investigative hearing, it took a median of 62 days to issue a decision; for those resolved without a hearing, it took a median of 21 days. The NLRB does not track the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an election. The NLRB does not collect data on the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an election. A recent study estimated that within two years of winning an NLRB election, a contract had not been reached in over two-fifths of cases. This is a higher percentage than found in estimates from previous studies. The NLRA does not require secret ballot elections, as an employer may voluntarily recognize a union through a \"card check\" process. An employer may voluntarily recognize a union through a \"card check\" process, where authorization cards signed by a majority of employees in a bargaining unit are presented. A card check agreement may require a supermajority of signatures and be validated by a neutral third party. Employees under voluntary recognition have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition for representation by another union. Under voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition for representation by another union. A neutrality agreement may include a card check arrangement where the employer remains neutral during a union organizing campaign. This agreement allows for communication between the union and employees, access to company property, and sharing of employee names. A neutrality agreement allows managers to provide information to employees, give union access to company property, and share employee names. Unions may engage in corporate campaigns to gain employer agreement for a card check campaign. This may involve consumer boycotts, rallies, public relations campaigns, and support from leaders to be recognized by the employer. The final way a union may be recognized by an employer is through a bargaining order issued by the NLRB if unfair labor practices have occurred. Each case is based on specific facts, and bargaining orders may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The NLRB issues bargaining orders based on specific facts, which can be appealed to higher courts. Winning a secret ballot election certifies a union as the bargaining representative, providing advantages like protection from decertification for a year. Certification can only be obtained through an NLRB election, not voluntary recognition or bargaining orders. Winning a secret ballot election certifies a union, providing advantages like protection from decertification for a year. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on certification by the board or voluntary recognition. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain for a year; under voluntary recognition, bargaining is required for a reasonable period. Under voluntary card check recognition, the employer must bargain in good faith for a reasonable period of time. If no contract agreement is reached after one year, the employer can withdraw recognition of the union if there is doubt about majority employee support. This can be based on objective information like a petition signed by a majority of employees. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. An employer could withdraw recognition if they believed authorization cards were obtained through misrepresentation or coercion. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required employers to recognize a union supported by a majority of employees or face a bargaining order. The NLRB abandoned this doctrine in 1969, allowing employers to voluntarily recognize a union or request an election if a majority of employees signed authorization cards. In a 1974 ruling, the Supreme Court stated that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. The NLRB has since considered cases of voluntary recognition. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. The NLRB has recently reviewed cases involving voluntary recognition, such as instances where employees filed decertification petitions after the employer recognized a union under a card check agreement. Examples include agreements between the UAW and Metaldyne Corporation in 2002 and the UAW and Dana Corporation in 2003. In December 2003, maintenance workers at the St. Marys, Pennsylvania plant and employees at the Upper Sandusky, Ohio plant were recognized by their employers after card check and neutrality agreements with the UAW. Decertification petitions were filed by employees in both cases, but were dismissed by regional NLRB directors citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. The NLRB granted a request to review decertification petitions following voluntary recognition of a union. Employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union, and a rival union has the same timeframe to file an election petition. The NLRB granted a request to review decertification petitions following voluntary recognition of a union. Employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union, and a rival union has the same timeframe to file an election petition. The board reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases in August 2011. In July 2003, Lamons Gasket and the United Steelworkers (USW) entered into a card check agreement, and in November 2009, Lamons Gasket voluntarily recognized the USW as the sole representative of a unit of employees. In November 2009, Lamons Gasket voluntarily recognized the United Steelworkers (USW) as the sole representative of a unit of employees. Following a 3-1 decision, the NLRB established a rule that after voluntary recognition, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period of time, defined as at least six months but not more than a year after the first bargaining session between the employer and union. The NLRB established a rule that after voluntary recognition, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period of time, defined as at least six months but not more than a year after the first bargaining session between the employer and union. The Chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested information on cases related to the Dana decision and Lamons Gasket. The committee requested information on cases related to the Dana decision and Lamons Gasket, including dismissed cases and election petitions filed under the Dana decision. Once a union and employer have a collective bargaining agreement, election petitions are subject to a \"contract bar\" for up to three years. In August 2007, the board allowed an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. In January 1999, Shaw's Supermarkets entered into a five-year contract with the UFCW. After three years, a majority of employees requested a decertification election. Shaw's withdrew recognition of the union, leading to an appeal to the NLRB. Current rules prevent the employer or incumbent union from initiating an election petition during a contract. Employees or another union can file after three years of a contract exceeding three years. The NLRB ruled that Shaw's Supermarkets could withdraw recognition of the union during the five-year contract, as the employer had evidence of a loss of majority support. The dissenting member argued for a decertification election to be held. Once a union is certified, an initial contract agreement is not required. The NLRB ruled that Shaw's Supermarkets could withdraw recognition of the union due to a loss of majority support. If a union and employer cannot reach a collective bargaining agreement, it is called an impasse, which may lead to a work stoppage. A neutral third party can help them reach a contract agreement through mediation. When mediation is used to resolve a collective bargaining impasse, a mediator assists the union and employer in reaching an agreement by defining issues, suggesting solutions, and promoting compromise. In arbitration, an arbitrator decides on resolving disputes over existing collective bargaining agreements (grievance arbitration) or determining terms for initial or successor contracts (interest arbitration). Interest arbitration can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer. In interest arbitration, an arbitrator determines contract terms and conditions, which can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer. Final-offer arbitration allows the arbitrator to choose between complete final offers from the employer and union. The law requires parties to use arbitration, which can be conventional or final-offer. In conventional arbitration, the arbitrator can decide on a final contract agreement, while final-offer arbitration requires choosing either the union's or the employer's final offer. Arbitration can also be package-based or issue-by-issue, and can be binding or nonbinding. Different forms of arbitration can be combined. In arbitration, there are different forms such as binding and nonbinding. Med-Arb combines mediation and arbitration, where a neutral party facilitates an agreement and becomes the arbitrator if no settlement is reached. Interest arbitration is used in the public sector to resolve bargaining impasses. Interest arbitration is commonly used in the public sector to resolve bargaining impasses, where the right to strike is limited. In the private sector, parties may voluntarily use interest arbitration to reach a contract agreement. It can deter strikes or lockouts but may also change negotiating behavior. If a union and employer reach an impasse, they can turn to mediation or arbitration. Interest arbitration is utilized to resolve bargaining impasses and avoid strikes or lockouts. However, it may alter negotiating behavior and have a \"chilling\" effect on negotiations. Strikes can lead to permanent replacement of workers, imposing costs on both parties. Interest arbitration can impose costs on workers and employers, with a \"chilling\" effect on negotiations. It may lead to extreme positions and a reliance on arbitration, hindering serious bargaining for future contracts. Final-offer arbitration is proposed as a solution to the chilling effect of conventional arbitration, where parties may be more willing to compromise if an arbitrator is limited to selecting the last offer of either the union or employer. This approach aims to encourage both sides to make offers that they believe will be acceptable to the arbitrator, potentially leading to a contract settlement without arbitration. Final-offer arbitration allows the arbitrator to choose between the complete final offer of either the union or employer, or between the final offers of each party on each issue. This approach gives the arbitrator more discretion in crafting the agreement and may encourage bargaining and concessions. The NLRA does not exempt small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low revenues. The NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low revenues. The board requires more than one employee for collective bargaining and statutory jurisdiction over employers affecting interstate commerce. Administrative standards are based on annual sales or gross revenue for NLRB jurisdiction. The NLRB has administrative standards based on annual sales or gross revenue for asserting jurisdiction over questions of union representation. These standards have been in effect since August 1, 1959, and were established by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The NLRB has jurisdictional standards based on annual sales or gross revenue for asserting jurisdiction over union representation, established by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. Section 14(c)(1) of the NLRA allows the board to decline jurisdiction over labor disputes not affecting commerce substantially, but must assert jurisdiction if the employer meets the standards in effect on August 1, 1959. The NLRB has jurisdictional standards based on annual sales or gross revenue for asserting jurisdiction over union representation, established by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The board must assert jurisdiction over a labor dispute if the employer meets the standards in effect on August 1, 1959, but may decline jurisdiction if the dispute does not substantially affect interstate commerce. Smaller employers may unionize through other means if the board does not assert jurisdiction. The NLRB has jurisdictional standards based on annual sales or gross revenue for asserting jurisdiction over union representation. A report by the Government Accountability Office estimated that 5 million employees of small employers do not have collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. The dollar amounts for the jurisdictional standards are not adjusted for inflation, affecting which employers meet the standards today. The 5 million estimate of employees without collective bargaining rights could be higher or lower today due to inflation. Recent legislation has proposed changes to union certification procedures, including secret ballot elections or card check certification. These changes may impact unionization levels in the United States. Recent legislation has proposed changes to union certification procedures, including secret ballot elections or card check certification. Supporters and opponents of card check certification argue about potential coercion and access issues during unionization campaigns. Proponents of secret ballot elections argue for privacy and confidentiality, while unions argue that card check certification is less costly. Research suggests that changes in union recognition procedures could impact unionization levels in the United States. Research suggests that changes in union recognition procedures, such as requiring secret ballot elections, could impact the level of unionization in the United States. Studies show that unions have a higher success rate with card check certification compared to secret ballots, and they undertake more unionization drives under this method. Evidence from Canada indicates that automatic card check recognition leads to higher union success rates than secret ballots. In Canada, union recognition procedures vary among provinces. Some provinces require secret ballot elections for union recognition, while others use card check recognition. Under mandatory voting, a union must win a majority of votes in a secret ballot election to be recognized. On the other hand, under card check recognition, a union is automatically recognized if a certain percentage of employees sign authorization cards. Studies show that unions have a higher success rate under card check recognition compared to secret ballots in Canada. In Canada, union recognition procedures vary among provinces. A study found that the union success rate is nine percentage points higher under card check recognition than under secret ballots. In British Columbia, union recognition based on card checks was allowed until 1984, then required secret ballot elections until 1992, and card checks were reinstated in 1993. The union success rate dropped almost 19 percentage points with mandatory voting in 1984 but increased when card check recognition was reinstated in 1993. The union success rate in Canada fell by almost 19 percentage points after mandatory voting was adopted in 1984 and increased by the same amount when card check recognition was reinstated in 1993. There were about 50% fewer attempts to organize workers during mandatory voting. In Ontario, card check recognition was allowed before 1995, but secret balloting has been required since then. A study showed that the certification rate was higher with card checks, but the union success rate fell from 72.7% to 64.3% under secret balloting. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check. After the change to secret ballots, the union success rate decreased from 72.7% to 64.3%. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. Elections are held within five working days after an application under secret balloting. The study included private and public sector employers but excluded the construction industry. The study on unionization in Canada found that a 1% increase in unionization raised short-term unemployment by 0.30 to 0.35 percentage points. Card check recognition combined with a neutrality agreement led to higher union success rates in organizing drives. The study found that unions had a 78.2% success rate in organizing drives with card check recognition and a neutrality agreement, compared to 62.5% with just a card check agreement. Card check recognition may lead to higher success rates due to less employer opposition, lower costs, and shorter timelines compared to secret ballot elections. Neutrality agreements may further reduce employer opposition, contributing to higher union success rates. Requiring card check certification along with a neutrality agreement may increase union success rates by reducing employer opposition. However, the impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization is uncertain. Americans generally support unions, as shown in a 2008 Gallup poll. According to polls, Americans generally support unions, with 59% approving and 31% disapproving. In March 2009, 53% favored a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 39% opposed it. Another poll showed 33% agreeing that Congress should change laws to facilitate union formation, while 40% disagreed. Sixty-one percent agreed that a secret ballot should be required for union formation. According to surveys, 61% of respondents agreed that a secret ballot should be required for union formation, while 32% believed a union should be formed if a majority of workers sign a card. 57% found it difficult to form a union. According to surveys, 75% believe a secret ballot election is the most fair way to decide on union membership, while 12% prefer card check recognition. Another survey found that 22% of workers felt pressure from management during a union organizing campaign, compared to 6% experiencing union pressure. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. It aims to improve workers' bargaining power. Governments intervene in labor markets to enhance competition. The economic rationale for protecting workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively is to improve competition in labor markets. Competitive markets lead to efficient resource allocation, resulting in greater output and consumer satisfaction. Wages in competitive labor markets reflect the value of workers' contributions, including compensation for unfavorable working conditions. Under perfect competition, wages reflect the value of workers' contributions and may include compensation for unfavorable working conditions. The theory of compensating wage differentials acknowledges individual preferences for various working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. In monopsony labor markets, unionization may raise wages and employment. However, in competitive labor markets, increasing employees' bargaining power could lead to a misallocation of resources and reduce total economic output. In monopsony labor markets, unionization can increase wages and employment. However, in competitive labor markets, higher union wages may reduce employment for union workers and lower the relative wages of nonunion workers. Determining the competitiveness of labor markets is challenging due to varying levels of local, regional, national, or international competition. The competitiveness of labor markets can be challenging to identify and measure, as they can be local, regional, national, or international. Governments may intervene to reduce earnings inequality through means like unionization, which can also provide workers with a voice in the workplace. Some economists argue that reducing earnings inequality during a recession can boost aggregate demand and lower unemployment. Some economists argue that unions can reduce earnings inequality by giving workers a voice in the workplace through collective bargaining. This can lead to higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions for unionized workers. The economic impact of union practices like card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' objectives and the level of competition in labor markets. Collective bargaining by unionized workers can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. The impact on economic efficiency depends on the level of competition in labor markets. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates, while secret ballot elections could decrease them. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates, potentially raising the level of unionization and reducing earnings inequality. On the other hand, secret ballot elections could lower union success rates, leading to a decline in unionization and potentially increasing earnings inequality. The impact on economic efficiency is dependent on the competitiveness of labor markets, with the effects of these changes being difficult to predict or measure accurately. Requiring secret ballot elections may increase earnings inequality if fewer workers are unionized, while card check certification may reduce inequality if more workers are unionized. The size of the effects is challenging to predict or measure accurately."
