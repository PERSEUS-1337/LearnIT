Factors such as reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives may have contributed to this decline. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its high social and economic costs. Despite the decline in the teen birth rate, Congress continues to be interested in the issue due to its high social and economic costs. Disparities persist in teen birth rates among racial and ethnic subgroups and across states. The report discusses Congress's current approach of supporting programs to prevent teen pregnancy. Teen birth rate refers to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, including live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data cover nearly every birth in the U.S., while pregnancy data are distinct. The teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, encompassing live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data cover nearly every birth in the U.S., while pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems and surveys. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates a year or two after birth data. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers, with approximately 3.8 million births in the U.S. in 2018. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. In 2018, about 180,000 births (4.7%) were to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The U.S. teen birth rate peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and then declined in most years from the 1960s through the 1980s. From 1991 to 2018, the teen birth rate dropped by 72%, with the greatest decline occurring in recent years. The teen birth rate in the US dropped significantly from 1991 to 2018, with a 72% decline. In 2018, the rate was at a historical low of 17.4 births per 1,000 teens. The decline was most significant in recent years, with a 58% decrease from 2007 to 2018. Repeat teen births also decreased by nearly 54% from 2004. In 2018, the birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births have declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015. The prevalence of repeat teen births was highest among Hispanic youth, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. Teen mothers have been less likely to be married in recent years. Unmarried teen birth rates decreased from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. Despite an overall decline, certain racial and ethnic groups still have relatively high teen birth rates. In 2018, the teen birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 was 16.0 per 1,000, compared to 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010. Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, had more than double the teen birth rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. Teen birth rates varied based on race and ethnicity, with a long-term decline starting in 1991 and a slight increase in 2007. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by race and ethnicity, with declines from 1991 to 2007. From 2007 to 2018, rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 58% for non-Hispanic black teens, 73% for non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander teens, and 65% for Hispanic teens. Despite greater declines for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens, their rates remained higher than white teens. Teen birth rates for ages 15 to 19 varied by state in 2018, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate at 7.2. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate at 7.2 and Arkansas the highest at 30.4. California, Colorado, Connecticut, and other states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens, while Alabama, Arkansas, and others had rates of 25 or higher. Teen birth rates in territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4. From 2007 to 2018, teen birth rates decreased in all states and territories by 19% to 67%. Rates in rural areas remain higher than in urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate, although declining, is still higher than in most industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom. The reasons for this disparity have not been fully explored. The U.S. teen birth rate of 18.8 in 2017 was 50% higher than the United Kingdom's rate of 12.6. Reasons for the high U.S. teen birth rate compared to other countries include economic conditions and income inequality. Research suggests that contraceptive use among teens is higher in other developed countries. Factors driving down U.S. teen pregnancy rates include improved contraceptive use, such as an increase in condom use. Research indicates that the risk of teen pregnancy decreased primarily due to improved contraceptive use, including an increase in condom use and the use of multiple contraception methods. The use of contraceptives among sexually active teens has also contributed to recent declines in teen pregnancy rates. Increased contraceptive use, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and the withdrawal method, among teens may be influenced by economic and social factors. Factors such as expanded educational and labor market opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology have driven behavioral changes. Some attribute the long-term decrease in teen birth rates to the recession that began in 2007, suggesting that economic downturns may lead teenagers to be more cautious. Despite this, the teen birth rate continued to decline. Teen birth rates have decreased during economic downturns, possibly due to teenagers being more cautious after witnessing their families' financial struggles. Factors like social media and shows like 16 and Pregnant have also influenced teens' knowledge about sex and birth control. Some attribute the decline in teen births to increased contraceptive use and teen pregnancy prevention programs. Teen birth rates have declined, potentially influenced by factors like social media and shows like 16 and Pregnant. Observers suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs may also play a role in the decreasing birth rate. Teen pregnancy has significant costs for families and society, with teenage parents facing lower education levels and higher poverty rates. Teen parents face challenges such as lower education levels and higher poverty rates. Nearly one-third of teen girls who drop out of high school cite pregnancy as a reason, and 7 out of 10 teen mothers living independently are below the poverty level. Over 60% of teen mothers receive public benefits within the first year after giving birth. These outcomes may be due to differences in background between teen mothers and those who delay childbearing. Teen mothers often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with parents receiving public welfare benefits and having lower education levels. Teen sexual activity can lead to STIs, affecting long-term health. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high STI rates. Children of teenage mothers have poorer outcomes, including chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness, poor academic performance, early childbirth (females), and incarceration (males). Teen mothers, especially those in their early 20s or later, are more likely to have chronic medical conditions, use public health care, have lower school readiness scores, perform poorly in school, give birth during their teen years (females), and be incarcerated (males). A study examined the societal impacts of teen childbearing, estimating cost savings to public programs from avoiding unintended pregnancies during the teen years. The analysis found a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015, considering costs to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care. The analysis estimated a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015 due to decreased teen fertility rates. This includes cost savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care, as well as benefits from programs like TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Further research on the impacts of decreased teenage pregnancy could provide valuable insights for teen parents, their children, and society."
