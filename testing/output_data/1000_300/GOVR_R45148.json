    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods they produce less efficiently, driven by comparative advantage. Trade allows for higher consumption levels and importing goods can boost consumer welfare. The United States imports goods for various reasons, including products that cannot be produced domestically in sufficient quantities or are more cost-effective to produce by foreign firms. Imports are necessary for various reasons, such as goods that cannot be produced domestically in sufficient quantities or are more cost-effective to produce by foreign firms. Through trade, consumers can access a greater variety of goods at lower cost, improving purchasing power and controlling inflation. Producers benefit from lower-cost inputs and improved global competitiveness through exports. Overseas markets provide opportunities for domestic firms to exploit economies of scale. Trade helps control inflation by providing access to lower-cost inputs for production and exports, improving global competitiveness. It also allows firms to exploit economies of scale in overseas markets, leading to increased productivity and economic growth. The concept of comparative advantage, introduced by economist David Ricardo in the 19th century, explains how specialization and trade benefit countries even if one is more efficient in producing all goods. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries benefit from specialization and trade. He argued that even if a country is more efficient in producing all goods, specialization and trade are still mutually beneficial. The key factor is the opportunity cost, not the absolute cost of production. By specializing in goods where they have a comparative advantage, countries can realize gains from trade. Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage states that countries benefit from specializing in goods they can produce well and trading for goods they produce less efficiently. Economic theories have expanded on this concept, examining how it applies to modern trade patterns with global value chains and digital trade. Differences in comparative advantage between countries can evolve due to varying factors abundance. The theory of comparative advantage explains how countries benefit from specializing in goods they can produce efficiently and trading for goods they produce less efficiently. This concept has evolved to consider modern trade patterns with global value chains and digital trade, where differences in comparative advantage arise due to varying factors abundance like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Countries are expected to have comparative advantage in activities that make intensive use of their relatively abundant factors of production. The United States has a relative abundance of high-skilled labor and scarcity of low-skilled labor, leading to a comparative advantage in goods requiring high-skilled labor. Differences in technology among countries can also impact efficiency and comparative advantage. Governments can influence comparative advantage through policies that indirectly or directly support specific industries. Policies can influence comparative advantage by either compensating for market failures or nurturing advantages in specific industries through industrial policy. Indirect influence includes measures like eliminating corruption and liberalizing trade, while direct influence involves subsidies or tariffs to promote strategic industries. Debate exists on the effectiveness of targeted policies, with concerns about potential distortion of trade and investment flows. Some economists debate the impact of protectionist policies on a country's trade and investment flows. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies, suggesting trade based on economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. Trade patterns can be driven by economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. Countries tend to specialize in producing and trading a subset of goods due to limited productive capacity. Trade impacts employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living positively overall. Trade is a key force driving changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living in the U.S. economy. Overall, trade has a positive effect on economic well-being by promoting resource efficiency, competition, economies of scale, and consumer welfare. Increased trade can boost GDP and reduce extreme poverty globally. However, the benefits of trade may not be evenly distributed, leading to disruptions in certain sectors and regions, with costs such as job losses and stagnant wages. Trade has reduced poverty by half over the past 25 years, but benefits are not evenly distributed. Job losses and stagnant wages may be concentrated in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the impact of trade on jobs and wages, with policies needed to help those affected by market forces. Adjustment assistance is seen as a more economically viable solution than protective policies. Trade has reduced poverty by half over the past 25 years, but benefits are not evenly distributed. Job losses and stagnant wages may be concentrated in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the impact of trade on jobs and wages, with adjustment assistance seen as a more economically viable solution than protective policies. Policymakers continue to debate the effectiveness of existing policies to help communities affected by trade, with many experts concluding they have been inadequate. Trade \"creates\" and \"destroys\" jobs in the economy, just as other market forces do, leading to disruptions in different occupations and even through domestic trade. Trade liberalization can lead to job shifts within and between industries, causing disruptions in different occupations. Estimates show that job loss due to trade is a small share of overall job losses, with one study finding that expanded trade in manufactured goods led to the loss of 150,000 U.S. net jobs annually between 2001 and 2016. Between 2001 and 2016, expanded trade in manufactured goods led to the loss of 150,000 U.S. net jobs annually. Some workers may be reemployed elsewhere, but switching occupations due to trade liberalization can result in substantial costs, including reduced wages. Import competition from China has negatively impacted U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Economists argue that equating a trade deficit with unemployment is questionable due to underlying drivers. Most economists argue that linking a trade deficit with unemployment is questionable, as economic growth often leads to an increased trade deficit. International trade can impact worker wages and income inequality, with no clear consensus on the overall effect of trade agreements on U.S. workers. Trade and trade agreements can impact worker wages and income inequality in the United States. Studies show no consensus on the overall effect, with factors like technological change playing a larger role in wage trends. Increased imports, especially from countries like China with abundant low-skilled labor, could negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. A large increase in imports, particularly from countries like China with abundant low-skilled labor, could negatively impact wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. U.S. workers face competition from lower-cost producers in developing countries, leading some multinational corporations to shift production overseas. However, workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average, with a 16% earnings premium estimated by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Economic globalization involves increasing integration of national economies through trade, financial flows, technology transfer, and labor migration. U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average, with a 16% earnings premium in export-intensive manufacturing industries and a 15.5% premium in services. Scholars have identified periods of economic globalization and deglobalization. The most recent period of economic globalization began after World War II, with global trade increasing from 25% to 57% of global GDP from 1960 to 2017. Foreign direct investment also grew significantly during this time. Technical advances in transport and communication have reduced barriers to international exchange, aided by policies that have lowered man-made barriers since World War II. Globalization, facilitated by advances in transport and communication, has reduced natural and man-made barriers to international exchange. Economists debate the inclusivity and impact on inequality of economic integration. Global value chains, organized by multinational corporations, involve interrelated organizations and processes to create and deliver products to consumers. Global value chains (GVCs), organized by multinational corporations (MNCs), involve interrelated organizations, resources, and processes to create and deliver products to consumers. Products are now produced by assembling parts and components from multiple countries, with a significant portion of global imports being intermediate goods and services. GVCs have driven globalization and are crucial for international trade. The growth of Global Value Chains (GVCs) has increased the foreign value-added share in U.S. exports, driving globalization and facilitating lower trade barriers. This has blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign activities, making it challenging to understand who benefits from global trade and interpret bilateral trade balances. The growth of Global Value Chains (GVCs) has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it difficult to determine who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates has made imports essential for exports, shaping the latest wave of globalization. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a major driver of trade, influencing cross-border capital flows. Foreign direct investment (FDI) drives trade by creating global value chains through multinational corporations (MNCs) sourcing production globally. This leads to increased inter- and intra-firm trade between parent companies and their foreign affiliates. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services. Foreign direct investment (FDI) drives trade by creating global value chains through multinational corporations (MNCs) sourcing production globally. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets, maintaining operations close to customers to understand preferences. In 2016, 11% of sales of U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, 59% to the host country's market, and 30% to other foreign countries. Some firms establish operations abroad to replace exports, access raw materials, or cheaper labor. Greater global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development, while outsourcing production to countries with lower labor costs. Multinational corporations (MNCs) focus on high-end activities like R&D, outsourcing production abroad. Globalization may impact U.S. employment and income volatility. Wealth distribution affected by lower wages for lower-skilled workers and higher returns to capital. Globalization impacts wealth distribution by dampening wages for lower-skilled U.S. workers facing foreign competition and increasing returns to capital. Studies show globalization contributes to rising wage inequality in the U.S. by 10-20%. Most-favored-nation treatment is a key principle in the World Trade Organization. Wage inequality is impacted by globalization, with studies showing a 10-20% increase. Most-favored-nation treatment in the WTO requires equal treatment among member countries, with exceptions for trade agreements and special treatment for developing nations. National treatment is also a key principle. In the WTO, countries grant additional preferences to each other outside the organization, with special treatment for developing nations. National treatment ensures non-discrimination between domestic and foreign products, services, and intellectual property rights. Most-favored nation status guarantees equal treatment of trading partners, known as permanent normal trade relations in the US. Cuba and North Korea do not have this status with the US. Most-favored nation (MFN) trade status, known as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) in U.S. law, ensures nondiscriminatory treatment of trading partners. Cuba and North Korea do not have PNTR with the United States. Countries may receive temporary or conditional NTR status before transitioning to PNTR. Imports from countries with NTR status face lower duty rates. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving such treatment in January 1975. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR status to countries restricting freedom of emigration. The U.S., as a WTO member, must extend MFN treatment to all WTO members immediately and unconditionally. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR status to countries restricting freedom of emigration. Upon accession to the WTO, countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia had to establish PNTR under U.S. law to receive full benefits. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification developed by the World Customs Organization. The Harmonized System (HS) groups products into 96 chapters with detailed subheadings at the 6-digit level. Each chapter represents a specific category, with higher digits indicating more detailed product descriptions. HS codes are standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level, while the U.S. further subdivides them into unique 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The Harmonized System (HS) categorizes products into 96 chapters with detailed subheadings at the 6-digit level, identified by 6-digit HS code 0805.10. The U.S. further subdivides HS codes into unique 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Rules of origin (ROO) determine the \"nationality\" of imported products, impacting duty rates and eligibility for trade programs. Determining a product's origin can be complex in today's global economy. In today's global economy, determining a product's origin can be complex due to parts sourced from multiple countries. The United States negotiates rules of origin (ROO) within its FTAs to ensure tariff benefits for eligible trading partners. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners. Some argue it is strict, while others say it is crucial for U.S. survival. Global trade is a significant driver of the economy, with trade as a share of global GDP increasing from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. Trade openness and reforms have been linked to higher growth in productivity, real incomes, and reduced poverty worldwide. However, recent years have seen weakened trade growth, with 2016 marking the slowest pace since 2009. Various factors have been attributed to this slowdown, including the global economy's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Trade growth has fluctuated in recent years, with 2016 being the slowest since 2009. Factors such as weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices have contributed to this slowdown. However, trade growth rebounded in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. The IMF and WTO projected a further rebound in trade growth for 2018 and 2019, despite risks such as rising trade tensions. Global trade growth rebounded in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. However, due to rising trade tensions and uncertainty, the IMF and WTO now expect a slowdown in global trade growth. Restrictive trade policy measures imposed by the United States and its major trading partners are affecting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors. Analysts warn that recent policy announcements have harmed businesses' outlooks and investment plans. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if its 28 members are treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017 due to increased global trade among developing countries and emerging markets. In 2017, the United States was the largest importer and exporter in services trade. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017 due to increased global trade, especially among developing countries and emerging markets. The U.S. export share of global services is 14%, and in 2017, U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index in 2017. U.S. exports have grown over 40% in the past decade, while imports have grown over 20%. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with exports as a percent of GDP expanding from 5% to 12% in 2017. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States when considering the 28 member states as a single trading partner. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without free trade agreements. Multinational corporations produce worldwide using inputs from various countries, leading to complex value chains that make interpreting trade data challenging. The growth of global value chains and trade in intermediate goods has made interpreting trade data challenging for the U.S. economy. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the true source of resources used in production. For example, products like iPhones, developed by U.S. firm Apple, are assembled in China using components from various countries. When the U.S. imports iPhones, the full value is attributed to China, even though the value added there is small. Apple benefits the most from the profits generated by its products. In China, the value added is small, but Apple benefits the most from profits. U.S. imports from China actually come from many countries, leading to an inflated trade deficit. \"Trade in value-added\" (TiVA) measures the origin of value added in goods and services. TiVA estimates show the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 using this measure. The trade deficit is the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services. The U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if measured by the origin of value added. A deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports, indicating that the nation consumes more than it produces. The United States has a trade deficit, consuming more than it produces. In 2017, the deficit was $552.3 billion, driven by goods trade. The U.S. usually runs surpluses in services, with a surplus of $255.2 billion in 2017. The current account includes trade in goods, services, net income, and government flows, with the U.S. experiencing an annual deficit. The United States had a $449.1 billion current account deficit in 2017, down from its peak of $806 billion in 2006. The deficit was due to reduced demand for imports after the 2008 financial crisis and lower commodity prices. The trade deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports. The U.S. global trade deficit is mainly attributed to an imbalance between domestic savings and total investment, leading to borrowing from countries like China. This borrowing allows for higher economic growth, increasing consumption and demand for imports, resulting in a trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by factors like domestic savings, economic growth differences between countries, and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Foreign investors contribute to the deficit by loaning funds to finance the lack of savings in the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit can continue if foreign investors loan funds to finance the lack of savings in the U.S. economy. The U.S. current account deficit relative to GDP has declined since reaching a historic high in 2006, consistent with trends in the mid-1980s. Countries with a ratio below 100 of gross domestic savings to total investment, like the United States, are net borrowers and typically run current account deficits. The United States, along with the United Kingdom and Canada, had the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP in 2017. Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had the largest current account surpluses. Some policymakers believe that U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China are a result of unfair trade practices, such as trade barriers and subsidies, affecting specific products and countries. These policies have less impact on the overall global U.S. trade deficit. The impact of market-distorting trade policies, such as trade barriers and subsidies, on bilateral trade may not significantly affect the global U.S. trade deficit, which is mainly influenced by low U.S. savings. Reduction of protectionist measures in certain countries could boost U.S. exports, but without changes in consumption and savings behavior, the overall trade deficit would remain unchanged. Trade diversion could occur if protectionist measures are altered in one country, shifting trade to another country. The U.S. trade deficit remains relatively unchanged despite market-distorting trade policies. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Complex supply chain relationships with certain trading partners, like China, contribute to bilateral trade deficits. The U.S. trade deficit, particularly with countries like China, is influenced by complex supply chain relationships. A trade deficit leads to adjustments in the economy, affecting exchange rates. The surplus of U.S. dollars flowing abroad can lower the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. The U.S. trade deficit, especially with countries like China, is impacted by supply chain relationships. The surplus of U.S. dollars abroad can devalue the dollar, making imports costlier and exports more competitive. Foreign countries, like China, invest in U.S. Treasury securities, causing the dollar to appreciate and making U.S. exports pricier. Some countries (like China) have intervened to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar by buying dollars and reinvesting them in the U.S. This intervention has hindered the global trade balance realignment. Trade deficits indicate a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the U.S. borrowing from abroad and accumulating debt. The impact of borrowing to finance imports depends on whether the funds are used for productive investments or current consumption. Borrowing to finance new technology and productivity-enhancing products can lead to higher economic growth in the long run. However, borrowing for consumer purchases may burden future generations without improving the ability to repay. A rising U.S. trade deficit could potentially cause a sharp decline in the value of the dollar, risking financial instability domestically and internationally. Foreign investors may lose confidence in the U.S. as a reliable debtor or investment destination. The rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a significant drop in the dollar's value, potentially causing financial turmoil domestically and internationally. Economists suggest reducing the deficit by increasing domestic savings or limiting foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates and preventing currency manipulation by other countries are also viable solutions. Trade policies play a crucial role in addressing these issues. The United States trade deficit in 2017 was $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for 56% of exports and 70% of imports. The share of U.S. exports from manufactures has decreased over the past decade, while the share of imports has increased. Top exports and imports include transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, and chemicals. The share of U.S. exports fell 4 percentage points over the past decade, while the share of U.S. imports from manufactures increased by 4 percentage points. Top exports and imports include transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have transformed U.S. manufacturing, with advanced technology driving production and labor-intensive activities moving abroad. Reports of factory closings and layoffs have reinforced the perception of a shrinking U.S. manufacturing sector. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a decline in employment but an increase in output due to increased productivity. Despite the sector's relative decline compared to services, it remains a significant component of the economy. From 1980 to 2017, manufacturing real output increased by over 80%, and since 2009, it increased by about 20%. Reports of factory closings and layoffs have contributed to the perception of a shrinking manufacturing sector. Despite a decline in employment, U.S. manufacturing has seen an increase in output. From 1980 to 2017, manufacturing real output rose by over 80%, with a 20% increase since 2009. However, the share of manufacturing in GDP decreased from 21% in 1980 to 11% in 2017, while services increased from 55% to 70%. Employment in manufacturing fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising since 2010. Manufacturing now accounts for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment has led to a decrease in its share of total nonfarm employment, dropping from 20.7% in 1980 to 8.5%. The shift towards services has increased by 20 percentage points over the same period. Various factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and trade have contributed to these changes in the manufacturing sector. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment was influenced by factors such as trade, automation, and a fundamental restructuring of the sector. Despite challenges in measuring manufacturing activity, it remains a significant component of the U.S. economy, accounting for a large portion of private-sector research and development and exports. While the U.S. share of global manufacturing value-added has decreased, manufacturing still plays a crucial role in the economy. Manufacturing is a significant part of the U.S. economy, accounting for a large portion of research and development and exports. The U.S. remains a top global manufacturer, with a trade surplus in agricultural goods. Agriculture exports make up 6% of total U.S. exports, while imports account for 4%. Foreign markets play a major role in the agricultural sector, with exports representing about 20% of total farm production by value. Over the past decade, U.S. agricultural exports account for about 20% of total farm production by value, with foreign markets playing a significant role. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices have a large share in U.S. food consumption. \"Services\" encompass various economic activities that not only serve as end-use products but also facilitate the economy. Services play a crucial role in the economy, including construction, computer services, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, financial services, retail, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications. They not only serve as end-use products but also facilitate the economy by moving products along global value chains, opening e-commerce channels, and providing credits for manufacturing. Barriers to trade in services are different from those faced by goods suppliers, often occurring within the importing country rather than at the border. Barriers to trade in services are often within the importing country, favoring domestic providers over foreign ones. In 2017, the US had a $255 billion trade surplus in services, with exports totaling $798 billion and imports at $542 billion. In 2017, the United States had a $255 billion trade surplus in services, exporting $798 billion and importing $542 billion. Services trade accounts for 79% of U.S. GDP and 82% of U.S. private sector full-time employment, playing a significant role in the economy. Unlike goods trade, the U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports, helping to offset deficits in goods trade. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to measurement methods. Trade in services has helped offset U.S. trade deficits in goods. Conventional trade data may underestimate services trade, as it does not measure on a value-added basis. Intermediate services within a value chain include transportation, R&D, design, and business services. Digital trade not only includes end-products but also enhances productivity and competitiveness. Digital trade encompasses a wide range of value-added services that enhance productivity and competitiveness. Examples include online shopping, communication channels like email, and financial services used in e-commerce. Trade barriers in digital trade can be classified as tariff or nontariff barriers, with the latter imposing restrictions on what firms can offer in a market or how they operate. Nontariff barriers in digital trade, such as data localization requirements, restrict cross-border data flows and can limit the type of services a firm can offer or how it can communicate with subsidiaries abroad. Data localization barriers can restrict data flows and limit services that a firm can offer internationally. The United States has historically focused on supporting economic growth through trade agreements and enforcing trade commitments. The United States aims to overcome trade barriers, enforce trade commitments, and provide relief to companies facing unfair competition. U.S. trade policy also focuses on supporting economic development, strengthening alliances, and advancing strategic goals. The current Administration's trade objectives include promoting national security, negotiating better trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. Key trade functions of the U.S. government include formulating trade policies and negotiating agreements. The U.S. government's trade policy focuses on promoting national security, negotiating better trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. Key trade functions include formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. Congress plays a significant role in trade policy through legislative and oversight authority, working with the executive branch to implement agreements. The USTR and multiple U.S. agencies are involved in implementing trade policy, requiring interagency coordination. The USTR and multiple U.S. agencies work together to implement trade policy, with interagency coordination being crucial. The USTR serves as the President's main trade policy advisor and negotiator. Other agencies, like the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture, have specific roles in trade programs. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution designates Congress as the primary authority over trade policy, granting them the power to regulate commerce and make necessary laws. Congress exercises this power through tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and trade agreements. U.S. trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress, governing areas such as tariffs, nontariff barriers, and import/export policies. Congress plays a crucial role in trade policy by passing laws governing areas such as tariffs, nontariff barriers, and trade remedies. They also set trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority and oversee trade programs and agreements to ensure compliance with U.S. law and congressional intent. The President is delegated certain powers to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action on trade policy. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to enter into agreements to reduce tariffs within preapproved levels. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded this authority to open markets and negotiate international trade norms. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have primary responsibility for trade matters. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee are key in trade agreements and policy changes. They have subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees may also be involved if trade matters fall under their jurisdiction. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. During trade agreement negotiations, Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs) provide advice to USTR. Separate CAGs are established for both houses, chaired by key committee members. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting, committee participation, testimony, written letters to USTR, and informal influence over other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA) streamlines the process for approving trade agreements. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by ensuring a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments in Congress. This process requires that the trade agreement meets specific negotiating objectives and is notified to Congress during the TPA period. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by ensuring a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments in Congress. To be eligible for expedited consideration, a trade agreement must be negotiated, concluded, and notified to Congress during the TPA period, reflecting specific negotiating objectives. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and gives the President negotiating credibility. Congress first enacted TPA in 1974 and has renewed it four times, with the most recent legislation signed into law in 2015. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expedites trade agreement approval in Congress with no amendments. TPA was first enacted in 1974 and renewed four times, with the latest law signed in 2015. The executive branch is responsible for executing trade policy, including negotiating treaties, implementing trade agreements, customs enforcement, and budget proposals for trade programs. The President directs overall trade policy and specific trade functions. The USTR, a Cabinet-level appointment, is the chief adviser on trade policy to the President. They are responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to enhance the focus on trade and provide balance between competing interests. The USTR, established in 1962, plays a key role in advising the President on trade policy, negotiating agreements, and enforcing trade laws. Various government agencies are involved in trade functions, coordinating positions through an interagency process. The USTR plays a key role in advising the President on trade policy, negotiating agreements, and enforcing trade laws. Various government agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, State, and the Treasury, are involved in trade policymaking and enforcement. The USTR has primary responsibility for trade negotiations, but decisions often involve other Cabinet-level departments, requiring a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by the USTR, to facilitate this process. The USTR advises the President on trade policy and negotiates agreements. Various government agencies are involved in trade policymaking. The President influences trade legislation and makes decisions on U.S. trade policies. Trade advisory committees provide advice to the executive branch. The President plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. trade policy by directly participating in key trade decisions and influencing trade relations with foreign leaders. The private sector and stakeholders contribute through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress. The advisory system established by Congress consists of 28 committees with citizen advisors, overseen by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement. It includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, general policy advisory committees, and technical advisory committees in industry and agriculture. These committees ensure that U.S. public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs, providing information and advice on negotiating objectives for trade agreements. The private sector, NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders also influence U.S. trade policy in various ways. The advisory system, consisting of 28 committees overseen by USTR, provides information and advice on trade agreements. Private sector, NGOs, and other stakeholders shape U.S. trade policy by testifying before congressional committees and government bodies, providing assessments of trade negotiations' impact, and submitting comments on trade initiatives through Federal Register notices. The executive branch seeks comments from stakeholders on trade initiatives through Federal Register notices. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups lobby Congress and the executive branch on U.S. trade policies. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, with various goods and services being tradeable. Trade policy decisions can impact a wide range of interests in the United States. Trade policy decisions in the United States can have a significant impact on various industries, firms, and workers, influencing employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for consumers. Stakeholders, including businesses, farmers, workers, consumers, and public interest groups, strive to ensure their views are represented in trade policy decisions. Legal challenges may arise in federal court from importers and exporters regarding trade agreements and rulings on antidumping cases. Groups representing businesses, farmers, workers, consumers, and public interest groups strive to ensure their views on trade policy decisions are represented. Legal challenges in federal court may involve customs classification, antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, national security investigations, and enforcement of customs laws. Some trade statutes may prevent judicial review. The federal government enforces customs laws and trade restrictions through legal proceedings against individuals and firms. Court decisions, particularly in the U.S. Court of International Trade, can have a significant impact on U.S. trade policy by reviewing agency actions and interpreting statutory mandates. Judicial review may be limited in cases involving AD and CVD proceedings, WTO agreements, and free trade agreements. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. Formerly known as the Customs Court, it was renamed in 1980 and consists of nine judges. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City, formerly known as the Customs Court, has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters. It consists of nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trade liberalizing agreements are negotiated by the United States for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons, aiming to reduce tariffs and nontariff barriers. The United States negotiates trade liberalizing agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons. Objectives include reducing tariffs and nontariff barriers, gaining competitive advantages for U.S. firms, increasing market access for exporters, and encouraging trading partners to liberalize their trade and investment regimes. The United States participates in various trade agreements to integrate with the global economy, strengthen alliances, and increase influence in different regions. These agreements include multilateral agreements in the World Trade Organization, free trade agreements negotiated outside the WTO, and bilateral or regional agreements involving multiple countries. Plurilateral agreements focus on specific sectors and involve more than two countries. The United States has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, with the majority of its FTA partners being small developing countries. While some major trading partners like Canada and Mexico are covered, only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners. Over 99% of U.S. trade is with WTO member countries, with 65% of trade being with WTO members without an FTA. The Trump Administration has brought a shift in trade negotiation approach. The Trump Administration has shifted U.S. trade policy by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and focusing on bilateral trade deals. They have renegotiated two FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the USMCA agreement signed in November 2018. The Trump Administration has shifted U.S. trade policy by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and focusing on bilateral trade deals. They have renegotiated two FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the USMCA agreement signed in November 2018. The renegotiation of the USMCA was conducted under TPA procedures, allowing for expedited consideration by Congress. Amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA were also negotiated, with the most significant being the delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff on imports from South Korea. Additionally, USTR notified Congress of its intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom in October 2018. The United States has pursued new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with negotiations set to begin in early 2019. U.S. FTAs are known for their comprehensive coverage of tariffs, enforceable commitments, and rules that go beyond WTO standards. These agreements typically include the elimination of tariffs on goods, reduction of services trade barriers, rules on foreign investment, intellectual property protection, government procurement market access, and provisions on labor and environmental standards. The U.S. has also focused on establishing new trading rules in recent negotiations, such as digital trade and state-owned enterprises. The United States has more than 50 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries, allowing for consultations on mutual economic interests to promote trade and investment. TIFAs are nonbinding agreements that do not require congressional approval but can lead to further negotiations such as Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) leads TIFA talks and can establish joint ministerial-level councils and issue-oriented working groups with TIFA partners. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 as part of the post-WWII effort to create an international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the World Trade Organization (WTO) was formed in 1995. The core principles of GATT focused on lowering tariffs and applying them in a nondiscriminatory manner. The GATT, established in 1947, aimed to lower tariffs and apply them in a nondiscriminatory manner. Despite its ineffective enforcement mechanism, it led to a significant reduction in trade barriers. The WTO, formed in 1995 with 164 member countries including the US, administers trade rules to eliminate barriers and facilitate trade negotiations and dispute resolution. The WTO, established in 1995 with the US as a key player, governs trade rules and agreements resulting from negotiations like the Uruguay Round. It encompasses agreements for goods, services, intellectual property, and oversees negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda. The WTO oversees multilateral and plurilateral negotiations among members, including the Doha Development Agenda which has been stalled since 2015. The latest Ministerial Conference in 2017 did not yield major results, with ongoing talks in fisheries subsidies and e-commerce. Several members are committed to progressing ongoing talks in fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, as well as pursuing new plurilateral negotiations. The effectiveness of the WTO in broad-based trade liberalization and resolving trade disputes has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round. Reforms are being considered to maintain the WTO's role in the global trading system, including improvements to the dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, raising concerns about judicial overreach. If new appointments are not made, the dispute settlement system could cease to function by late 2019. The WTO Appellate Body is facing approval delays due to concerns over judicial overreach and procedures. Without new appointments, the dispute settlement system may cease to function by late 2019. Members can challenge trade practices through dispute settlement proceedings, starting with consultations and potentially leading to a panel decision and appeal to the Appellate Body. If a violation is found, the defending member must remove the measure or face temporary retaliatory action. Since 1995, 575 dispute settlement complaints have been filed in the WTO. The United States has been actively involved in the WTO dispute settlement system, being the complainant or respondent in the most cases. Pending disputes include challenges to recent tariff measures by the Trump Administration. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, so findings of inconsistency with U.S. WTO obligations may not be implemented. The WTO decisions on challenges to recent tariff measures imposed by the Trump Administration may not have a direct impact on U.S. law. If a U.S. statute, policy, or practice is found to be inconsistent with U.S. WTO obligations, USTR may decide on compliance actions, including amending regulations or issuing new determinations. The United States generally aims to comply with WTO decisions, which may involve paying compensation to complainant countries. The United States generally aims to comply with WTO decisions by paying compensation to complainant countries. U.S. FTAs also have procedures to resolve disputes through consultations or panels, with possible trade benefit suspensions for non-compliance. State-state dispute settlement under U.S. FTAs is not frequently used. The United States aims to comply with WTO decisions by paying compensation to complainant countries. Disputes under U.S. FTAs are usually resolved through consultations, with possible trade benefit suspensions for non-compliance. State-state dispute settlement is not commonly used in U.S. FTAs, with most disputes adjudicated under WTO rules. NAFTA has a unique binational panel system for reviewing trade remedy laws, and there is a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions in most U.S. FTAs. The US complies with WTO decisions by compensating complainant countries. Disputes under US FTAs are resolved through consultations, with potential trade benefit suspensions for non-compliance. NAFTA and proposed USMCA maintain a binational panel system for reviewing trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the US market for selected exports from eligible developing countries, including GSP, APTA, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. GSP covers 120 countries and territories. In 2016, Congress passed country-specific trade preferences for Nepal under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity Through Partnership Encouragement Act (HOPE). The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is the largest U.S. trade preference program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. In 2017, $21 billion imports entered the United States under the GSP program. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including protections for intellectual property rights and worker rights. The USTR is currently conducting eligibility reviews of several GSP beneficiary countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance, such as funding, training, and technical expertise. The USTR is conducting eligibility reviews of GSP beneficiary countries like India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries in international trade. The U.S. invested $1.2 billion in TCB activities in FY2016 across 134 countries. TCB helps countries negotiate trade agreements, implement customs reforms, improve labor and environment protections, and meet export standards. The U.S. provides assistance for trade capacity building (TCB) to developing countries, including implementing customs reforms, improving labor and environment protections, and meeting export standards. Various U.S. agencies are involved in TCB activities, with USAID receiving the most funding. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. Developed countries like the U.S. now rely on other means for revenue generation. Tariffs are customs duties on imports and exports, with the power partially delegated to the President. Developed countries like the United States now use other methods for revenue generation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs at ports of entry, amounting to $32 billion in 2016, just 1% of federal revenue. The U.S. has used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization, reduce or eliminate tariffs through trade agreements, and authorize the President to negotiate reciprocal reductions since 1934. The United States has reduced tariffs through trade agreements since 1934, with global tariffs falling to less than 7% by 2012. U.S. tariffs average 3.3% across all products, with 70% entering duty free. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. The Trump Administration has criticized low-tariff policies and increased tariffs on certain goods imported from key U.S. trading partners. U.S. trade laws include antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices, administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. trade laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are enforced by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, patent infringements, and counterfeit goods, all in compliance with U.S. WTO obligations. Supporters argue that these laws are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers from unfair competition. The U.S. trade laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are enforced to protect industries and workers from unfair competition. Antidumping is a common practice where exporters sell goods at lower prices in one market to gain market share or deter competition. AD duties are imposed to address this issue. The U.S. trade laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are enforced to protect industries and workers from unfair competition. Antidumping involves selling goods at lower prices to gain market share or deter competition. AD duties are imposed when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the U.S., causing material injury to a U.S. industry. AD orders are subject to annual review and sunset review every five years. The U.S. had 354 AD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with over one-third against China. Countervailing duty (CVD) is another commonly used trade remedy law to offset injurious competitive advantages of foreign manufacturers or exporters. As of mid-December 2018, the United States had 113 countervailing duty (CVD) orders in place, with nearly half against China. CVD laws aim to offset the competitive advantage foreign manufacturers gain from government subsidies. These duties are imposed on imports of subsidized goods to the U.S. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to temporarily restrict imports that cause or threaten harm. The United States had 113 CVD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restrict imports causing harm. Safeguard actions provide temporary relief to domestic industries without requiring allegations of unfair trade practices. The ITC conducts investigations based on petitions and makes recommendations to the President for final action. The ITC conducts safeguard investigations initiated by petitions from trade associations, companies, or unions representing U.S. industries. If imports are found to cause serious injury, recommendations are made to the President for final action. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration, resulting in safeguard measures on solar cells and large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 34 cases affirmatively determined. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 is known as the \"national security\" provision. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, also known as the \"national security clause,\" allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies to investigate the impact of imports on national security. The President can then impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures based on the findings. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department conducts investigations based on specified factors, and the President can impose tariffs or quotas as needed. Recently, tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum imports due to national security concerns. Investigations are ongoing for uranium, autos, and auto parts imports. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is another means to enforce U.S. trade rights. The Administration is currently conducting Section 232 investigations of uranium imports and autos. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is used to enforce U.S. trade rights by addressing unfair barriers to U.S. exports, including inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. USTR can initiate cases based on violations of trade agreements or unjustifiable practices, seeking negotiated settlements with trading partners. USTR enforces U.S. trade rights by addressing unfair barriers, seeking negotiated settlements with trading partners. If no resolution is reached, USTR may retaliate with tariffs. The \"Special 301\" provision requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR protection. Countries can be designated as a \"Priority Foreign Country\" and subject to Section 301 investigations. Since 1974, USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases, retaliating in 16 instances, with almost half occurring in the 1980s. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation of China's IPR technology policies. In March 2018, USTR found certain Chinese policies to be discriminatory, leading to increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China. China responded with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products, and both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO. China responded to increased tariffs on U.S. imports by imposing tariffs on $110 billion worth of American products. Both countries pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China had not changed its unfair practices. Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate structural changes in IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make substantial purchases of U.S. products, and the U.S. agreed to suspend tariffs. China and the United States agreed to negotiate changes in IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make substantial purchases of U.S. products, and the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair acts in importing goods to the U.S., including infringement of patents, copyrights, and trademarks. The import or sale of infringing products is illegal under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 if U.S. industry is producing a covered article. The ITC conducts investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs provide federal aid to workers and firms affected by trade. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs offer federal aid to workers and firms impacted by trade, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974. TAA for Workers (TAAW) is the main program, providing assistance to workers affected by foreign competition through job loss or relocation. Administered by the Department of Labor, TAAW offers benefits like career services, training, and income support. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) provides various benefits and services to workers affected by foreign competition, including funding for career services, training, and income support. TAA programs aim to offset the challenges faced by firms and workers due to trade liberalization, offering a less disruptive option for adjustment. The justification for TAA lies in promoting economic efficiency and equity by facilitating the adjustment process and compensating those impacted. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is seen as a less disruptive option for offsetting policy-driven trade liberalization. Justification for TAA includes arguments for economic efficiency, equity, and generating support for international trade. Critics argue that TAA is costly, inefficient, and may not be equitable for all affected groups. Despite differing opinions, Congress has consistently supported TAA programs. Several federal agencies, including the Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency to succeed OPIC, with varying mandates emphasizing U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency to succeed OPIC, focusing on U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. U.S. trade financing aims to level the playing field for U.S. firms against foreign competitors with subsidized financing. The Ex-Im Bank provides financial support for U.S. exports to developing economies. The Ex-Im Bank, the official U.S. export credit agency, provides direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance to help finance U.S. exports to developing economies. Despite its reauthorization, the Ex-Im Bank has been constrained in its operations due to unfilled positions on its board of directors, limiting approval of medium- and long-term export financing above $10 million. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over the role of government in financing exports. The Ex-Im Bank's approval of medium- and long-term export financing above $10 million has been constrained. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over government's role in export financing. Export controls are controversial due to balancing national security goals with export competitiveness. The United States restricts exports through various acts for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, nuclear materials, and items related to weapons proliferation through various authorities. Export controls are administered by multiple departments and require licenses. The Export Control Act of 2018 provides broad authority for implementing dual-use export controls, replacing the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Control Act of 2018 replaced the expired Export Administration Act of 1979 and authorizes the Department of Commerce to establish controls on the export of dual-use goods and technologies essential to U.S. national security. Examples of dual-use goods include nuclear materials, electronics, and lasers. Licenses for exports are issued by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security based on technical characteristics, destination, and end use. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) licenses exports of dual-use goods and technologies, such as microorganisms, electronics, and lasers. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets in another country, while foreign portfolio investment (FPI) includes purchasing foreign equities or bonds. FDI stimulates direct employment, while portfolio investments are highly liquid. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from $4 trillion to $23 trillion between 1990 and 2017. Gross capital flows also expanded from $1 trillion to $4 trillion during the same period, with a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007. Foreign direct investment involves long-term commitments and stimulates direct employment, while portfolio investments are highly liquid and can be withdrawn easily. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes. The global trade in goods and services grew significantly from $4 trillion to $23 trillion between 1990 and 2017. Capital flows, including direct, portfolio, and other official investments, expanded to about $4 trillion annually, with a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007. There was also significant growth in foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives markets, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods and services. Foreign currency trading exceeded $5.1 trillion daily in 2016, with firms investing abroad to increase profits. The latest survey of the world's leading central banks indicated that the total daily trading of foreign currencies was more than $5.1 trillion in 2016. Multinational corporations invest abroad to increase profits, driven by factors such as competitive advantages, low-cost resources, and intra-firm relationships. FDI is motivated by more than just access to resources, with a focus on improving efficiency and market share. Multinational corporations (MNCs) invest abroad to improve efficiency, market share, and access resources. FDI supports global value chains and allows firms to operate close to customers with different preferences. Foreign markets provide access to skilled workforce and R&D opportunities. Some FDI transactions involve mergers and acquisitions to enhance global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion according to UNCTAD. According to UNCTAD, global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion. The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI, with developing Asia leading in FDI inflows. FDI transactions can involve mergers and acquisitions to enhance global competitiveness. The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI, with Europe being the largest destination for U.S. FDI outflows. Nearly 60% of U.S. direct investment abroad is in Europe, while 68% of FDI in the United States comes from Europe. The largest sources of cumulative FDI inflows for the United States include the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, and Ireland. U.S. outward FDI is mainly in high-technology, finance, and services sectors, while inward FDI is primarily in manufacturing, especially chemicals and transport industries. Economists advocate for unrestricted international capital flows like FDI, as it benefits both home and host economies by enhancing firms' competitive advantages and skills in foreign markets. Direct investment benefits firms by allowing them to exploit competitive advantages and acquire skills in foreign markets, leading to a strengthened competitive position and higher incomes. Host countries benefit from inward FDI by adding to the capital stock, bringing technological advances, boosting capital formation, and contributing to a more competitive business environment. FDI also promotes international trade and global economic integration through established MNCs operating within global value chains. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) contributes to capital formation, a competitive business environment, and productivity growth. In 2016, foreign firm affiliates in the United States employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods, adding $894.0 billion in value-added to U.S. GDP. Concerns exist that U.S. firms invest abroad, leading to job outsourcing and reduced employment and wages domestically. U.S. firms investing abroad raise concerns about job outsourcing and reduced employment and wages domestically. Most data on shifting plants or jobs abroad is anecdotal. Outward FDI is mainly in high-income developed countries with similar markets. Economists argue there is no conclusive evidence that U.S. direct investment abroad leads to fewer jobs or lower incomes for Americans. Most economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad does not necessarily lead to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. The loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs is attributed to sector restructuring and domestic economic forces. International investment agreements establish rules on investment protections, with over 2,600 agreements in force globally aiming to reduce FDI restrictions and ensure nondiscriminatory treatment. IIAs have become the primary vehicle for promoting investment rules globally, with over 2,600 agreements in force. They aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors, and safeguard a government's right to regulate in the public interest. U.S. IIAs, such as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs), involve reciprocal commitments for foreign investors in the United States and U.S. investors in partner countries. The negotiation of U.S. IIAs is conducted by USTR and the State Department. The United States has bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with 40 countries, mostly developing nations. The latest BIT ratified with Rwanda in 2012. BIT negotiations with China and India have stalled. The U.S. also has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most including investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host governments for alleged violations before an international arbitration panel. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments for alleged violations of investment agreements before an international arbitration panel, such as ICSID. The number of ISDS cases has increased with global FDI growth, with U.S. investors accounting for about one-fifth of claims worldwide. Despite monetary penalties, countries cannot be forced to change laws based on ISDS decisions. The U.S. has not lost any of the 16 cases brought against it by foreign investors. ISDS provisions are common in U.S. BITs. The use of ISDS in recent U.S. trade negotiations has sparked debate over investor protections and government regulation. The Trump Administration made significant changes to ISDS under the NAFTA renegotiation, with the proposed USMCA aiming to eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada and impose limits with Mexico. The proposed USMCA would eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada, with specific limits for Mexico. ISDS has been a point of contention in trade negotiations, with the EU pushing for an investment court system. Foreign investment, especially by government-controlled firms, raises national security concerns. CFIUS oversees foreign investment transactions affecting U.S. national security. CFIUS, composed of nine Cabinet members, oversees foreign investment transactions affecting U.S. national security. Established in 1975, its authority was formalized in 1988 and expanded in 2007. The Secretary of the Treasury chairs CFIUS, conducting risk-based analysis on foreign investments in U.S. firms. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees foreign investment transactions impacting U.S. national security. The Secretary of the Treasury chairs CFIUS, which conducts risk-based analysis on mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers of U.S. firms by foreign investors. The President has the authority to block transactions, with recent examples including the blocking of acquisitions by Chinese and Singapore-based firms. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to CFIUS review. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands CFIUS review to include non-controlling investments in critical technology or infrastructure, raising concerns about the impact on open investment climate. OPIC supports U.S. private investments abroad, while the BUILD Act aims to enhance development through investments. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 establishes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to facilitate U.S. private investments abroad. SelectUSA, a Department of Commerce program, promotes foreign direct investment in the United States by providing information and advocating for investments."
