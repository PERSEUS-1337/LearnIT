    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms including \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" \"Federal entity,\" and \"Spectrum Relocation Fund.\" The \"Spectrum Relocation Fund\" refers to the fund established under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. \"Unlicensed operations\" involve using spectrum on a nonexclusive basis without protection from interference. The Federal Communications Commission is responsible for the allocation and allotment of spectrum. The Federal Communications Commission ensures a balance between exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, the Commission must establish rules for future allocation, including considering unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. These rules will be included in the service rules for spectrum auctions. The Federal Communications Commission establishes rules for spectrum allocation, including unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. The Commission ensures that these rules are included in service rules for spectrum auctions and reflected in reports submitted to Congress. The Federal Communications Commission establishes rules for spectrum allocation, including unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. SEC. 4. NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR UNLICENSED SPECTRUM. The United States aims to maximize spectrum utility, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The FCC will develop a national strategy within a year to make more radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for such use. The FCC will develop a strategy to clear radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations, ensuring access to low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum. Spectrum sharing rules will be considered to expand available ranges for unlicensed operations. The FCC will develop a strategy to clear radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations, including spectrum sharing rules to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations in various bands. This includes implementing a model for spectrum between 3550 and 3650 megahertz, allowing underlay unlicensed operations in allocated spectrum, examining ways to improve existing databases for spectrum access, and considering additional bands for unlicensed operations. The FCC will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of enacting the Act, detailing the strategy for clearing radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations and any legislative recommendations. The report will also be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund and ensuring its solvency will be considered in the report. The curr_chunk discusses sharing radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations, ensuring the solvency of the Spectrum Relocation Fund, permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without interference, and exploring other spectrum sharing techniques for access to Federal spectrum."
