    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The bill, H.R. 3962, would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The net cost of the coverage provisions would be $891 billion over 10 years, offset by other spending changes and increased federal revenues. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, would save $427 billion through spending changes and increase federal revenues by $574 billion. The bill aims to reduce the number of uninsured, restructure the private health insurance market, set minimum health benefit standards, provide financial assistance, and require individuals to maintain health insurance. H.R. 3962 aims to reduce the number of uninsured by requiring individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue would be implemented, with acceptable coverage including plans offered through the Exchange, employer plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Exchange, established under a new federal agency, would offer private plans alongside a public option. Subsidies for premium costs and cost-sharing would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely if no changes were made. The bill also includes a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to create not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange. It would not affect plans for specific services like dental or vision care. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The report provides background information on the private insurance market and summarizes key provisions of H.R. 3962, which includes altering how current private health insurance markets function. The bill establishes a CO-OP program and modifies tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to change private health insurance markets, focusing on individuals buying coverage directly or through small employers. Insurers would be required to cover pre-existing conditions and not charge based on them, aiming to prevent adverse selection. Insurers use tools like excluding pre-existing conditions to guard against adverse selection, which could lead to higher premiums and more uninsured individuals if eliminated by reform. Insurers guard against adverse selection by excluding preexisting conditions to prevent higher premiums and more uninsured individuals. AHIP suggests requiring individuals to purchase coverage to avoid only the sick enrolling. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical and market reforms possible. The government and/or employers must provide practical means for individuals to obtain health insurance, which is necessary for market reforms. Premium subsidies without cost-sharing may offer unaffordable health insurance. Private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, market reforms, immediate reforms, and a Health Insurance Exchange with a public option. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for employers to provide health insurance or pay into the Exchange, along with private health insurance market reforms. It also mentions different ways Americans obtain health insurance, such as through employment-based coverage or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fitting into one of three segments: the large group market, the small group market, and the nongroup market. Large employers, who make up more than 95% of the market, can obtain lower premiums for health insurance packages compared to small employers and individuals in the nongroup market. Large employers can obtain lower premiums for health insurance packages compared to small employers and individuals in the nongroup market due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Employers offer subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers. States have experimented with creating a single site for comparing insurance plans and pooling risk, learning from past failures like California's PacAdvantage. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance help individuals and small employers compare and obtain health insurance plans. Less than half of small employers offer coverage due to cost concerns and limited risk pooling ability. Insurers view small firms as less stable than larger pools. Employers often cite cost as the main reason for not offering health benefits. Small groups have limited ability to spread risk, making insurers view them as less stable than larger pools. Small firms face disadvantages in negotiating benefits and rates, lack economies of scale, and are more likely to be medically underwritten. Allowing these firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for those with high-cost employees. Allowing small firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or higher premiums based on health status in the nongroup market, affecting premiums for healthy and sick individuals. Reforms in premium ratings could increase or decrease premiums based on age, health, and behaviors. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with some federal regulations applying to employer-sponsored health insurance. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations applying to employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups and self-employed individuals in some states. Premium rating rules are imposed by most states. In the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in their nongroup markets. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for other factors like age or gender. In the small group market, only New York imposes pure community rating rules, while adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law requires group health plans to limit the exclusion period for preexisting conditions. As of January 2009, 21 states had preexisting condition exclusion rules exceeding the federal standard in the small group market. In January 2009, 21 states in the small group market had preexisting condition exclusion rules exceeding the federal standard. In the individual market, 42 states limit the period for excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions. Congressional attention is focused on the debate over offering a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of insurance market reform. A public option in health insurance reform could offer a less expensive alternative to private plans by not needing to generate profits or pay brokers. Proponents argue it could increase competition and choice, but opponents fear it could give the government an unfair advantage and drive private plans out of the market. The performance of health insurance organizations by profit status has also been a topic of discussion. Non-profit health insurance organizations have been found to perform better in key areas such as quality compared to for-profit organizations. Studies have shown that non-profit health maintenance organizations scored higher on quality measures. This has raised concerns that advantages of non-profit plans could drive private plans out of the market. A 2006 study of 272 health plans found that non-profit health insurance organizations, including health insurance co-operatives, performed well. Non-profit plans invest earnings back into the plan or enrollees for lower premiums, cost-sharing, and benefits. Congressional attention has focused on incentivizing the creation of more health insurance co-operatives. The creation of new health insurance co-operatives is being advocated for, with proponents arguing that co-operatives reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, and benefits. However, opponents claim that co-operatives have not been successful nationwide and may not make health insurance more affordable. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits and establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program. Health insurance issuers would need to provide rebates if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level. The bill includes provisions for insurance coverage in the small or large group market to provide rebates if the medical loss ratio falls below a specified level, with a minimum of 85%. This provision ends once plans are offered via the Exchange. It also applies to the individual market unless destabilization is a concern. Health insurance issuers must justify premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. The bill allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' plans. Pre-existing condition lookback period is reduced to 30 days in both markets. The bill would reduce the pre-existing condition lookback period from 6 months to 30 days and shorten coverage exclusions for certain benefits. It prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition and mandates coverage for a dependent child's congenital or developmental issues. Lifetime benefit limits are prohibited, and guidance would limit insurer rescissions. A temporary reinsurance program would be established to assist in the markets. The guidance in H.R. 3962 limits insurer rescissions and establishes a temporary reinsurance program to assist employment-based plans with providing health benefits. The bill also includes a mandate for individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes various health plans like QHBP, Medicare, Medicaid, and military coverage. Individuals who did not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage could face an additional tax, prorated based on income. Subsidies would be provided to some individuals to help with premium and cost-sharing expenses. H.R. 3962 would require individuals to file a tax return or pay the national average premium for health coverage. Subsidies would be available for some to help with costs. Exemptions from the individual mandate include nonresident aliens, those with religious exemptions, and dependents for tax purposes. Employers would need to offer coverage or contribute to the Exchange. Employers under H.R. 3962 must offer health coverage or contribute to the Exchange. They can offer employment-based coverage or coverage through an Exchange plan. Current plans are grandfathered for five years before needing to meet essential benefits package requirements. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan offered. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current employment-based plan they offer, prorated for part-time employees. They would automatically enroll employees in the plan with the lowest premium unless the employee opts out or chooses a different plan. Employers must provide written notice about auto-enrollment and show compliance with health participation requirements. Employers must provide a notice detailing employees' rights and obligations regarding auto enrollment in a QHBP or current employment-based plan. They must certify offering enrollment to full-time employees, provide monthly premiums, employee information, and other required details. Noncompliance could result in termination of health insurance election. Employers with wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would face an 8% excise tax. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer health coverage would be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees can opt out of employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with the employer facing payroll assessments for those who decline coverage. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer health coverage would be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees can opt out of employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with the employer facing payroll assessments for those who decline coverage. The payroll assessment for employees opting for Exchange coverage would not apply towards their premium, and full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer would generally not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. Small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. Small businesses could receive a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. The credit would phase out as employee compensation increased and would not apply to highly compensated employees. Adjustments for inflation would be made starting in 2013. The credit would be part of the general business credit and only available to businesses with a tax liability. H.R. 3962 introduces new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions or health status. The small business credit for employee health coverage would be limited to businesses with a tax liability and exclude highly compensated employees. The provisions in H.R. 3962 prohibit coverage exclusions for pre-existing health conditions and require coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. The provisions in H.R. 3962 require health coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis, with premiums determined using adjusted community rating rules. Premiums would only be allowed to vary based on age. Under H.R. 3962, health insurance premiums can only vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers are imposed, along with mental health parity rules. The policyholder has the option to keep qualified dependent children on the family's policy up to the age of 27. H.R. 3962 imposes new standards for health insurance premiums, non-discrimination, and adequacy of provider networks. It requires coverage to allow dependent children under 27 to stay on the family policy and mandates notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing. QHBPs must cover specific benefits, limit out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy and essential benefits package standards. Individual policies issued after 2013 can only be offered through an Exchange plan. H.R. 3962 sets new standards for health insurance plans, including network adequacy, essential benefits, and premium regulations. It mandates that individual policies issued after 2013 must be offered through an Exchange plan. Existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards by 2018, while nongroup policies can be grandfathered with certain conditions. States can form Health Care Choice Compacts to facilitate the sale of individual health insurance across state lines. The Health Care Choice Compacts allow the sale of individual health insurance plans across state lines, with coverage subject to the laws of one primary state. States can receive grants for regulating coverage in secondary states. QHBPs must cover essential benefits and can offer additional benefits. The essential benefits package for QHBPs must cover specified items and services, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit out-of-pocket spending, comply with network adequacy standards, and be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. It includes hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, and rehabilitative services. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes emergency department services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, maternity care, well baby and well child care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit is $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted for inflation. The Secretary establishes cost-sharing levels using copayments. The annual out-of-pocket limit for equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments, covering an average of 70% of health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans would have flexibility in offering different plan options. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, including cost-sharing levels and updates to the essential benefits package. Employer plans could offer plans with lower employee cost-sharing than specified for the essential benefits package. The Committee would align cost-sharing structures with actuarial values for different plan tiers in the Exchange. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, aligning cost-sharing structures with actuarial values for different plan tiers. The Committee would consider innovation in healthcare, reduce health disparities, and allow for public input. The Secretary must adopt benefit standards within 18 months, either by adopting HBAC recommendations or proposing alternatives. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans similar to online travel booking platforms. Additionally, the Exchange would have additional responsibilities beyond facilitating plan purchases. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established as a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, to provide individuals and small businesses access to insurers' plans. The Exchange would negotiate with plans, enforce requirements, determine eligibility for credits, and be funded by taxes on individuals without coverage and penalties for non-compliant employers. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund would be funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants. Only one Exchange could operate in a state, with the Commissioner approving state-based Exchanges meeting specified criteria. State-based Exchanges would be funded through federal matching grants, with the Commissioner approving those meeting specified criteria. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange, along with the public health insurance option and income-based premium and cost-sharing credits for certain individuals. The public health insurance option, income-based premium and cost-sharing credits, and coverage through the Exchange would be available. By 2019, 30 million people would have Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in certain plans like Medicare or Medicaid. Individuals eligible for Exchange coverage can enroll unless they qualify for Medicare, Medicaid, or other specified circumstances. Enrollment is continuous once individuals are enrolled, with an annual open-enrollment period from September to November lasting at least 30 days. Special enrollment periods are available for certain situations like loss of coverage or changes in dependent status. Employers can meet mandates by offering and contributing to employees' Exchange enrollment. Employers can meet the requirements of the employer mandate by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Exchange-eligible employers can enroll their employees through the Exchange, allowing them to choose from available plans. The eligibility criteria for employers to participate in the Exchange vary by year, with 25 or fewer employees eligible in 2013, 50 or fewer in 2014, and 100 or fewer in 2015. Larger employers may be permitted to participate in the Exchange starting in 2015, based on the Commissioner's discretion. Beginning in 2015, larger employers could be permitted to participate in the Exchange based on the Commissioner's discretion. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options into four tiers: Basic and Enhanced plans with varying levels of cost-sharing for essential benefits. The Exchange plans offer Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus options with varying levels of cost-sharing for essential benefits. Premium-Plus plans provide additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. A Premium-Plus plan is a Premium plan with extra benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans must follow cost-sharing levels set by the Secretary for each benefit category in the essential benefits package, with some flexibility allowed. States can require additional benefits for Exchange plans, but must reimburse the Commissioner for any increase in premium credits. H.R. 3962 establishes a public health insurance option through the Exchange, available to all individuals eligible to purchase insurance through the Exchange. The Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange under H.R. 3962. Any individual eligible for insurance through the Exchange could enroll in the public option and receive income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet requirements for benefits, provider networks, consumer protections, and cost-sharing. It would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with the possibility of Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set to cover expected costs, with limited start-up funding available and to be repaid within 10 years. The public option under H.R. 3962 would have geographically adjusted premiums to cover expected costs, with limited start-up funding available. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare providers, subject to limits, ensuring rates are not lower than Medicare and not higher than average rates paid by other qualified entities. Medicare-participating providers would also serve the public option, unless they opt out through a rule-making process. The public option in H.R. 3962 would have geographically adjusted premiums and payment rates negotiated by the Secretary for healthcare providers. Physicians could participate as preferred or non-preferred providers, with restrictions on balance-billing. Non-physician providers would be prohibited from balance-billing, and the Secretary could implement innovative payment methods. The Secretary would have the authority to use innovative payment methods under the public option, implement successful payment and delivery system reforms, enter into no-risk contracts for administration, and collaborate with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for cost collection. The Secretary would be required to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the collection of costs associated with nonservice-connected care provided in VA facilities to public health insurance enrollees. Enrollment in the public option would be voluntary, allowing individuals, including Members of Congress, to choose health insurance through any Exchange plan. Those who reject employer-sponsored insurance and opt for an Exchange plan would be responsible for 100% of the premium. The bill also mandates the Commissioner to establish a Consumer. Members of Congress who choose an Exchange plan would pay 100% of the premium. The bill includes a $5 billion CO-OP program for member-run health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with grants and loans for start-up and solvency. Conditions must be met for grants and loans to be approved. The CO-OP program for member-run health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange includes grants and loans with specific conditions for approval, such as being a not-for-profit organization, incorporating ethical standards, not being sponsored by a state government, and issuing QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange. The cooperative, not state-sponsored, issues QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange. It operates in all states it offers insurance, governed by member majority vote. Emphasizes consumer focus, using profits to lower premiums or improve benefits. Priority given to statewide cooperatives with integrated systems or strong financial support from non-governmental sources. The Commissioner prioritizes grants and loans for cooperatives that operate statewide, use integrated delivery systems, or have significant financial support. Violations of the CO-OP program require repayment of funds with interest. Premium credits may be available for some individuals based on income to help with health insurance costs, including cost-sharing subsidies. Integration across state lines is permitted for cooperatives. Under H.R. 3962, individuals eligible for premium credits can also receive cost-sharing credits to help with health insurance costs. These subsidies are available for Basic plans in 2013 and 2014, and for Enhanced or Premium plans starting in 2015. Exchange-eligible individuals must be lawfully present in the United States to receive credits. Under H.R. 3962, Exchange-eligible individuals can receive a credit if they are lawfully present in the U.S., have a MAGI of less than 400% of the FPL, and meet certain criteria. Premium credits are based on an \"affordable premium amount.\" The premium credit under H.R. 3962 is based on an \"affordable premium amount\" for individuals with a MAGI of less than 400% of the FPL. The Commissioner adjusts percentages to ensure the government's share of premiums remains consistent. The reference premium is calculated based on the three Basic plans with the lowest premiums in the area. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40878. The premium credit in H.R. 3962 is based on an \"affordable premium amount\" for individuals with a MAGI of less than 400% of the FPL. The reference premium is calculated based on the three Basic plans with the lowest premiums in the area. Premium percentage limits are established based on income tiers, with credits calculated monthly. Assistance is also provided for cost-sharing. The affordable premium credit amount in H.R. 3962 is calculated monthly based on income tiers, with percentage limits increasing on a sliding scale. Those eligible for premium credits also receive assistance for cost-sharing, with reductions specified by the Commissioner to align with actuarial values. Out-of-pocket maximums for cost-sharing are outlined in Table 3, with flexibility for adjustments by the Commissioner, and doubled for family coverage. The House bill includes provisions to limit employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modify tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Out-of-pocket limits for cost-sharing would be doubled for family coverage, with adjustments based on premium growth for Basic plans. The Commissioner would provide additional payments to insurers for reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. The House bill includes provisions related to health insurance coverage, limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidy payments, which are excludible from gross income and allow for business deductions. The House bill includes provisions related to health insurance coverage, limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidy payments, which are excludible from gross income and allow for business deductions. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the deduction by the amount of the federal subsidy received. This provision is estimated to raise $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. The revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 would affect tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health spending accounts (HSAs), health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), and Medical Saving Accounts (MSAs) allow workers to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. FSAs are funded through pre-tax salary reductions, with employers setting contribution limits. In 2008, the average FSA contribution was $1,350. H.R. 3962 proposes to limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation. This provision is estimated to generate $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs, unlike FSAs, allow for rollovers and accumulation of funds over time for qualified medical expenses. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to tax-advantaged health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible spending accounts (FSAs). HSAs allow for rollovers and accumulation of funds over time for qualified medical expenses. Distributions from HSAs used for qualified medical expenses are not taxable, but non-qualified distributions are subject to taxes and penalties. The bill increases the penalty on non-qualified distributions to 20%. Additionally, the proposal modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses affecting all tax-advantaged accounts. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 would modify tax-advantaged health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible spending accounts (FSAs), including changing the definition of qualified medical expenses. It would restrict coverage of over-the-counter medications in these accounts unless prescribed by a physician, increasing revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. The bill also addresses state laws on abortion coverage and federal conscience protection laws. H.R. 3962 would prohibit discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. It would also restrict the adoption of standards related to abortion as part of essential health benefits. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities for not providing, paying for, or referring for abortions. It restricts standards related to abortion in essential health benefits. The Stupak Amendment adds further restrictions on using funds for abortions. The Stupak Amendment, passed by a vote of 240-194, imposes restrictions on using funds for abortions unless a woman's life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. The Stupak Amendment allows nonfederal entities to purchase separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962, but it cannot be paid for with premium payments eligible for affordability credits. Premiums and administrative costs for the coverage must be paid for entirely with nonfederal funds. The Stupak Amendment allows nonfederal entities to purchase separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. The coverage must be paid for entirely with nonfederal funds, and administrative costs and services must be covered by premiums collected for the plan. Additionally, Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. H.R. 3962 allows states to receive incentive payments for implementing alternative medical liability laws that meet certain requirements. The law must improve the medical liability system, encourage error disclosure, and maintain access to affordable insurance. It should include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and cannot limit attorneys' fees or impose damage caps. The state law under H.R. 3962 must include an \"early offer\" system, a \"certificate of merit\" program, and cannot limit attorneys' fees or impose caps on damages. The early offer system allows a defendant to offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. If the offer is declined and litigation proceeds, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. The bill under H.R. 3962 includes provisions for an \"early offer\" system and a \"certificate of merit\" program for medical malpractice cases. If an early offer is declined, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. Incentive payments received by states must be used to improve healthcare, but the bill does not provide funds for these payments. The Act does not modify state laws governing legal standards or procedures in medical malpractice cases. The bill clarifies that it does not provide funds for medical malpractice payments and does not modify state laws. QHBPs must offer end-of-life planning information and options for advance directives, but are prohibited from promoting suicide or hastening death."
