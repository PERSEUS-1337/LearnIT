    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and the final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 was signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights personnel-related issues of congressional and constituent interest, with contact information for CRS analysts provided. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act. Background: The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were set before the September 11 terrorist attacks, with increases made for the Army and Marine Corps due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, recent years have seen decreases in personnel strength for the Army and Marine Corps, as well as declining end-strengths for the Air Force and Navy since 2001. In recent years, Congress has been reversing increases in military personnel due to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. The FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House approving higher numbers than the Administration's request, particularly for the Army. The House provision increased Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force end-strengths, while reducing Navy end-strength slightly. The final bill set minimum end-strengths equal to authorized levels for FY2017. Authorized end-strengths for Selected Reserves have declined by about 6% over the past 15 years. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two. The Senate bill proposed end-strengths identical to the Administration request, while the House bill differed for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000, aligning with the Administration's request for most components. This is in response to concerns about military personnel costs and the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel. The military pay raise is a topic of concern due to the overall cost of military personnel and the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel. The increase in basic pay for 2017 is set at 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. Congress has not specified an increase in basic pay for the past three years, with the President invoking alternative pay adjustments. The military pay raise for 2017 was initially proposed at 1.6% by the President, but Congress ultimately approved a 2.1% increase, effective January 1, 2017. The enacted bill for the 2017 military pay raise increased by 2.1%, effective January 1, 2017, waiving the automatic adjustment specified in 37 U.S.C. \u00a71009. Reference(s): CRS In Focus IF10260, Defense Primer: Military Pay Raise. Under current law, servicemembers are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). BAH is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status to provide suitable housing options. BAH rates vary by location but aim to ensure comparable housing for servicemembers of similar rank and family status. The Senate bill proposed changes to how BAH is calculated. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependency status. It aimed to base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade and adjust payments for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The new formula for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) would adjust payments for servicemembers who share living quarters, limiting the allowance based on the number of occupants. It would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting on January 1, 2018, including those who first become entitled to basic pay on or after that date and servicemembers who lose eligibility for BAH after December 31, 2017. The Senate provision aimed to adjust Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers who lose eligibility after December 31, 2017. The Secretary of Defense was required to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017. The enacted bill mandates a report by March 1, 2017, on transitioning to a new pay structure for recruiting and retaining a high-quality All-Volunteer Force, eliminating BAH and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The conference report proposed a new pay structure to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force by eliminating Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The intention of BAH was to provide a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas where government-provided quarters were not available, reflecting the transient nature of military service. The housing allowance was intended as a housing benefit for military members, shown by its tax-free nature and dependency status differentiation. The Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning the allowance with compensation rather than its original purpose. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce retired pay, adding a 401k-type element and continuation pay. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for eligible servicemembers. The military retirement system changes, effective January 1, 2018, include a reduction in the retired pay multiplier and the introduction of continuation pay as a retention incentive for servicemembers with 12 years of service. Active duty military and veterans' groups closely monitor these changes for their impact on retaining career military personnel. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the mid-career point, allowing flexibility to pay between 8 to 12 years of service in return for a 3-year commitment. This provision aims to manage personnel through targeted continuation pay based on retention trends for specific military specialties. Additionally, Section 633 of the bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. The enacted bill adopts an amended House provision that adjusts procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. It ensures that reserve component members on active duty receive the same minimum pay as active duty members when accepting continuation pay. The calculation of maximum pay remains unchanged. The Senate bill's provision regarding default contributions to the TSP being to a Roth plan was not adopted. A Roth plan, which is taxable at the time of contribution but allows tax-free earnings accrual, is considered beneficial for young, low-income individuals. The Senate bill's provision for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan, allowing tax-free earnings accrual, was not adopted. Section 631 of the Senate bill was adopted, allowing cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system. Background: Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. The law also permits certain former spouses to retain military benefits. The USFSPA has been amended multiple times. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases, with up to 50% of disposable military retired pay divisible. Proposed changes would base the division on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order. Cost-of-living adjustments are included in spousal payments. The enacted bill authorizes changes in the definition of disposable retired pay, including cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. This provision will not affect divorce settlements prior to the enactment date. Military retirees may have a portion of their retired pay withheld for Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) to provide a monthly survivor benefit after their death. A military retiree may have a portion of their monthly retired pay withheld for the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) to provide a survivor benefit to a surviving spouse or eligible recipients after their death. The survivor's payment is typically 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, for servicemembers who died on active duty, the base amount was 75% of their basic pay, while reservists who died during inactive-duty training had their base amount calculated based on years of service, resulting in a lower SBP payment. This issue was addressed in the FY2017 NDAA. Surviving spouses may receive annuities from both DOD as SBP beneficiaries and from the VA's Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. The FY2017 NDAA addressed the disparate treatment in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments for surviving spouses. Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) offsets reductions in SBP payments due to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). The enacted bill includes provisions to eliminate differential treatment under SBP for reserve and active component members who die from duty-related injuries or illnesses. Section 642 of the enacted bill eliminates differential treatment under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for reserve and active component members who die from duty-related injuries or illnesses. Section 643 allows the Department of Defense to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) when retired pay is insufficient. Section 646 extends authority to pay Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) until May 31, 2018 and requires a report on affected individuals within 90 days of enactment. Section 648 of Title 10, United States Code extends authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018. It requires an independent assessment of the SBP and a report on its effectiveness for survivors of servicemembers. The report will compare SBP benefits with those of other government and private sector employees, and explore alternative survivor benefit options. The SBP provides survivor benefits for servicemembers dying on active duty or in reserve active-status. A comparison of SBP benefits with other government and private sector employees is required, along with exploring alternative survivor benefit options. TRICARE is the DOD-administered health benefits program for active duty servicemembers, retirees, family members, and survivors. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to health care enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to the TRICARE health benefits program, including replacing current options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred, introducing new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. The proposal also included increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, with a focus on reducing TRICARE for Life expenditures. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. It also included increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, aiming to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures. The proposal would impact TRICARE for Life funding and contributions from uniformed services. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. The MERHCF for each uniformed service member is $4,252 for active duty and $1,723 for reserve component members. The CBO analysis estimated savings and costs for DOD over a 10-year period. Section 701 of the enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, replacing TRICARE Standard and Extra options, and modifies TRICARE Prime. The bill proposes changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. It establishes tables for TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime, sets enrollment periods, limits pre-authorization requirements, and requires a plan for access criteria by June 1, 2017. The bill proposes changes to TRICARE health benefits, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays. It requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017, and establishes a pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program. In its FY2017 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health benefits, including consolidating plan options and increasing co-pays. The enacted bill includes cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime options. Cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime options will be annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions will be provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors. TRICARE for Life beneficiaries' cost-sharing will remain unchanged. A new \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. Retired TRICARE beneficiaries eligible before 2018 will be subject to a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. The report will review changes in health care coverage, access to appointments, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries without a required referral must obtain a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if care is obtained without a required referral. Access to a pharmacy program is available for TRICARE beneficiaries through various outlets. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required refills for maintenance drug prescriptions. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required refills for maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual co-payment increases to save money. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. The House-passed bill for fiscal years 2017 to 2021 did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to continue receiving drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing amounts for certain groups. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would authorize the Secretary of Defense to exclude low-value drugs from coverage and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. This could reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021. Implementing Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would reduce DOD's net discretionary pharmacy costs by about $640 million over the 2017-2021 period. Additionally, it would decrease net health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over the 2017-2026 period. This section would also lower accrual payments into the DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund by approximately $1.5 billion from 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established on October 1, 2013, as a joint combat support agency to ensure Armed Forces medical services are ready for combat. It manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and serves as the market manager for the National Capital Region enhanced Multi-Service Market. Service surgeons general are involved in its operations. Contact: Don Jansen, x[phone number scrubbed]. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) currently manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs). A single agency responsible for all MTFs is believed to improve operational medical force readiness, beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and lower management costs. The conferees propose restructuring the military health system to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the experience of care for beneficiaries. This involves combining provisions from different bills to streamline management under the Defense Health Agency. The conference bill combines provisions to restructure the military health system under the Defense Health Agency, with Section 702 assigning responsibilities to the Director of the Defense Health Agency for the administration of Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) starting October 1, 2018. This includes budget, information technology, healthcare administration, and the establishment of a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency for oversight and direction. Surgeons General of each service will serve as principal advisors to the Secretary and senior uniformed officer. Section 702 assigns responsibilities to the Surgeons General of each service for the oversight and direction of Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). The Surgeons General will serve as principal advisors to the Secretary on health and medical matters, and are required to recruit, organize, train, and equip medical personnel. The Secretary must develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees by specified dates. The Government Accountability Office will also review the implementation plan. Section 703 of the enacted bill adds a new Section 1073d \"Military medical treatment facilities\" to Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code. This requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical centers, hospitals, ambulatory care centers, and satellite centers to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian health care facilities are unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. An exception is provided when a change in facilities or services eliminates access to care for covered beneficiaries. The provision in the enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the health care needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries, with an exception when access to care is eliminated for beneficiaries. Current law specifies eligibility criteria for active and reserve component enlistees. The Senate bill aimed to amend the citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees to align with those of the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. The current law requires reserve component enlistees to be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previous military service. Citizenship requirements can be waived if enlistment is deemed vital to national interest. The Senate bill did not include the provision to amend citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees. The Department of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. The Department of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently authorized for a maximum of 10 days. Servicemembers who adopt a child are eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. Section 521 of the enacted bill authorizes up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of the child and 6 weeks of leave for a primary caregiver in the case of an adoption. The provision authorizes up to 12 weeks of leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers could get up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense must define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event and is for active duty members or those on active duty recall or mobilization orders exceeding 12 months. The provision allows up to 12 weeks of parental leave for the primary caregiver and 6 weeks for adoption, with secondary caregivers eligible for up to 21 days. Leave must be taken within a year of the event and is for active duty members or those on active duty recall or mobilization orders exceeding 12 months. The Secretary of Defense may require servicemembers to extend their service obligation or reduce existing leave when taking parental leave. Section 521 of the final bill explicitly prohibits any leave beyond what is authorized by statute for military servicemembers. The conference report clarifies that military leave is established by law and may not be created without congressional authority. Paid parental leave is supported for recruitment and retention, benefiting military families. Opponents fear negative impacts on military readiness. Opponents of extending military maternity and parental leave are concerned about potential negative impacts on military readiness due to lost duty time and undermanned units. Congress has shown interest in improving the Defense Commissary system, with $1.4 billion authorized in FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retirees, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians overseas. Authorized patrons for the Defense Commissary system include active duty military members, retirees, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required a report for budget neutrality, which stated that privatization would not match the benefits and savings provided by DeCA. Critics argue that privatization poses too many uncertainties. The DOD report from June 7, 2016, acknowledges that privatization would not replicate the benefits and savings provided by DeCA. Critics argue that there are too many unknowns and call for further evaluation by DOD and Congress before initiating a pilot program. The Comptroller General was directed to assess DOD's plan in Section 651, subpart (d), which was published on November 9, 2016. The assessment highlighted that DOD's report lacks a plan to achieve budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018 without taxpayer dollars or impacting benefits. The DOD report from November 9, 2016, did not provide a plan for achieving budget neutrality in the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018 without taxpayer dollars or impacting benefits. The report addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks but lacked specific metrics for each benchmark and only partially discussed the other four mandated elements. Additionally, Section 652 of the FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program. Sections 661 and 662 of the bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card at commissaries. These reforms aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, provide value for taxpayers, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. The conference report highlights reforms to the commissary system, including congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. DeCA is expected to implement a variable pricing program for private label goods to offset operating costs. The CBO estimates that DeCA will implement a variable pricing program for private label goods to offset operating costs, reducing direct spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade. DOD is required to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and the military exchange network to reduce reliance on appropriated funds while maintaining commissary benefits. If established benchmarks are met, DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity. The DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for at least six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no DeCA employee incurs a loss in pay. DOD can contract with grocery industry experts to improve the commissary system. Military Star Card can be used at commissary stores. The Military Star Card can be used at commissary stores, as authorized in the conference report. Additionally, the DOD has plans to achieve budget neutrality for the commissary and exchange system. The DODIG Memorandum and GAO report highlight the importance of programs supporting servicemembers and veterans in education and employment opportunities. Key programs include TAP, COOL, and DOD Skillbridge. The final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation of credentialing programs for servicemembers and veterans. Sections 567 and 568 mandate DOD reports on transition initiatives for maritime operations. Section 3590 sets deadlines for processing TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, while sections 562 and 563 require DOD to provide notification about recoupment of separation payments and counseling on substance abuse during TAP training. The House bill requires DOD to provide information and application for ID cards to separating servicemembers as part of TAP. Sections 562 and 563 mandate notification about recoupment of separation payments and counseling on substance abuse during TAP training. Section 566, not adopted, would have authorized a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members. The most senior officers in the military are general officers (Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps) or flag officers (Navy), holding important positions in the DOD. Their ranks range from general or admiral (\"4-star\") to brigadier general or rear admiral\u2014lower half (\"1-star\"). The total number of general and flag officers in each grade is limited by statute. The number of general and flag officers in each grade is limited by statute, with Congress periodically reviewing and revising their number, duties, and compensation. Proposed legislation aimed to restrict the rank of service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders and establish a new unified combatant command for cyber operations led by an admiral or general. The Senate bill proposed reducing the number of authorized active and reserve general and flag officers by 25%, with a focus on higher-ranking officers. It also aimed to establish a new unified combatant command for cyber operations led by an admiral or general. Additionally, certain statutory grade requirements in various fields would be eliminated. The Senate bill aimed to reduce the number of authorized general and flag officers by 25%, with a focus on higher-ranking officers. It also proposed eliminating certain statutory grade requirements in various fields. The enacted bill requires a reduction of 110 general and flag officers by December 31, 2022, amounting to about an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The enacted bill requires a reduction of 110 general and flag officers by December 31, 2022, amounting to about an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The reductions in authorized positions will be distributed among the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and joint pool, with the possibility of alterations by the Secretary of Defense in the interest of national security. The enacted bill mandates a reduction of 110 general and flag officers by December 31, 2022, amounting to an 11% decrease in authorized positions. The Secretary of Defense can adjust the distribution of reductions for national security reasons, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Additionally, a global manpower study on general and flag officer requirements is required, with a 10% reduction in authorized positions and submission of results by April 1, 2017. Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. addresses the management of active duty officers trained in joint matters. There is ongoing debate about whether current qualification requirements produce officers with the right mix of service and joint experiences. Joint matters refer to achieving unified action by integrated military forces in operations. The debate revolves around the qualification requirements for officers to have a balance of service and joint experiences. Joint matters involve achieving unified action in military operations across different domains. To be a joint qualified officer, individuals must fulfill specific joint professional military education requirements and complete a full tour of duty in a joint setting. The debate focuses on the qualification requirements for officers to have a balance of service and joint experiences. To become a joint qualified officer, individuals must meet specific joint professional military education requirements and complete a full tour of duty in a joint setting, with assignments lasting at least two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers. The proposed changes aim to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers. The proposed changes aim to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers, expanding the definition of joint matters to include various duties and positions under unified command. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense would have the authority to designate other joint matters in regulation, with a modification to the definition of joint duty assignment to require the preponderance of duties to involve joint matters. The enacted bill modified joint duty assignments for officers, requiring the preponderance of duties to involve joint matters. The bill also expanded the definition of \"joint matters\" under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7668. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) requires most males between 18 and 26 in the US to register with Selective Service. Failure to register can result in criminal penalties and loss of certain benefits. Women in the US have never been required to register for the draft. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. The Senate bill proposed expanding registration requirements to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. Failure to register for the draft can lead to criminal penalties, loss of benefits, and denial of citizenship for immigrants. The final bill did not include the provision to expand selective service registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018. Questions have been raised about the necessity of the Selective Service System and alternative mechanisms for emergency manpower needs. The bill requires the DOD to conduct a detailed review of the Selective Service System and establishes an independent commission to examine military and public service issues. The final bill did not include the provision to expand selective service registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018. An independent commission, the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service, will be established to examine military and public service issues over 36 months with $15 million in funding in FY2017. In 2005, DOD issued sexual assault policies following recommendations from the Joint Task Force. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was established as DOD's primary oversight body. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was established in 2005 as DOD's primary oversight body for sexual assault prevention. DOD has implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, victim services, and reporting. The office is required by law to report statistics and analysis of sexual assault in the military annually. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) is mandated by law to report statistics and analysis of sexual assault in the military annually. The Senate bill aimed to extend reporting requirements to 2025, while the conference bill set the deadline for reports to be submitted to Congress by April 30. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted concerns about retaliation for reporting instances of sexual assault. Feedback from focus groups and surveys show servicemembers fear retaliation when reporting sexual assault. Both House and Senate bills aimed to increase training for investigators, but only the Senate provision was adopted. Concerns remain about confusion in defining retaliation and burden of proof requirements. The House bill did not adopt provisions to align burden of proof requirements with other retaliation investigation laws. The conferees are concerned about reports of retaliation against military personnel for protected communications. Sections 543 and 545 of the enacted bill require DOD to report on efforts to prevent and respond to retaliation in connection with military sexual assault. Congress is also addressing concerns about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma in the military. The enacted bill addresses concerns about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma in the military. Servicemembers with PTSD or TBI in connection with sexual trauma will have additional medical assessments and enhanced discharge review board consideration. DOD handles sexual harassment under the Military Equal Opportunity Program, while SAPRO oversees sexual assault policies. The enacted bill amends the law to apply to servicemembers and veterans who experienced PTSD or TBI in connection with sexual trauma. Concerns were raised about the definition of sexual harassment in the military, leading to modifications in the definition for investigating complaints by commanding officers. The bill modifies the definition of sexual harassment in the military for investigating complaints by commanding officers. There are approximately 1.1 million dependent children of active duty military servicemembers, with 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in FY2014 according to DOD statistics. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, raising concerns about prevention, management, and reporting of abuse in the Armed Forces. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) implements child and domestic abuse prevention initiatives and responds to suspected instances of abuse. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) responds to instances of domestic abuse and collects data on child abuse and neglect involving military families. The enacted bill requires DOD personnel to report suspected abuse to state child welfare agencies and mandates an annual report to Congress on abuse cases. This provision aims to enhance reporting and oversight of abuse within the military. The program report to Congress includes data on child abuse and domestic abuse, with the first report due on April 30, 2017. Proponents believe it will improve reporting and oversight of abuse in military families. The Senate bill required DOD schools to establish procedures for employee background checks, but this provision was not included in the final bill. Instead, the conference report urged DOD to collaborate with local school districts to share best practices for comprehensive employment. The conference report urged DOD to work closely with local school districts educating military family members to improve employment screening policies for the safety of military children. DOD is directed to provide a report to Congress within a year on identifying and addressing any employee screening process shortfalls in these school districts. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) at the recommendation of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey. This review aimed to address shortfalls in the implementation of the UCMJ through the Manual for Courts-Martial. Chuck Hagel directed a review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation through the Manual for Courts-Martial. The General Counsel established the Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) to propose legislative changes to the UCMJ and implementing rules in the MCM. On December 28, 2015, the results of the MJRG's work were released. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) proposed legislative changes to the UCMJ and MCM, resulting in the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress. The House bill included revisions to various aspects of military justice, such as courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. For example, the House bill would allow the government to appeal a sentence if it violated the law or was plainly unreasonable. The House bill proposed changes to the UCMJ and MCM, including revisions to courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. It granted the government the ability to appeal sentences that violated the law or were plainly unreasonable. The bill also reorganized punitive articles, creating new offenses like prohibited activities with military recruits and fraudulent use of credit cards.
