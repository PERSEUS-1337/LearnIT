    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or public health and safety risks. Protection for IC whistleblowers is crucial due to the involvement of classified information. Whistleblowing can lead to cost savings, promote ethical work environments, and prompt corrective actions. Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) can save taxpayers' dollars, ensure an ethical working environment, and enable timely corrective actions. Protections for IC whistleblowers only apply to lawful disclosures, not leaks to the media or foreign governments. The protections do not cover differences of opinion unless there are concerns over legality or constitutionality. Adverse personnel or security clearance decisions are not protected if the agency can prove they would have taken the same action without the disclosure. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) do not cover leaks to the media or foreign governments, only lawful disclosures. Adverse personnel or security clearance decisions can be taken if the agency proves they would have done so regardless of the disclosure. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has established procedures for IC whistleblowers, but there are concerns about transparency and adequacy of protections for IC contractors. IC whistleblower protections have evolved over time, with the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 being the first legislation specific to the IC. The protections were limited initially, but provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers were included in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 in 2012 provided more specific protections in response to concerns about reprisals against whistleblowers. IC whistleblowers have received evolving protections over time, with PPD-19 in 2012 and subsequent legislation like the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and P.L. 115-118 addressing gaps in protections for IC contractors. Military whistleblower protections are outlined in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 and DOD Directive 7050.06. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. It allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. The ICWPA, enacted in 1978, allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, ensuring protection of classified information. The IG must report credible complaints to the CIA Director or agency head within 14 days, who then reports to congressional intelligence committees within 7 days. If the IG fails to report accurately, the employee or contractor can submit the complaint to Congress. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, who must report credible complaints to the CIA Director or agency head within 14 days. If the IG fails to report accurately, the employee or contractor can submit the complaint to Congress. The ICWPA provides a process for whistleblowers to report complaints to Congress, but lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal or punishment. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 included provisions for whistleblower protection, allowing lawful disclosures to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. However, it lacked specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal or punishment. The Inspector General is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety within the intelligence community. The identity of the employee making the complaint must be kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice. No reprisal or threat of reprisal should be taken against the employee for making a complaint. The Inspector General can investigate complaints of violations within the intelligence community. The identity of the employee must be kept confidential unless necessary for the investigation. No reprisal should be taken against the employee for making a complaint. Section 405 covers contractors as well as federal employees in the intelligence community. The Inspector General can investigate complaints of violations within the intelligence community, including those made by employees or contractors. Protections against reprisals for whistleblowers are in place, with specific provisions for CIA employees and executive branch protections under PPD-19. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, protects IC whistleblowers with access to classified information from reprisals for lawful disclosures. It defines protected disclosures as information shared with specific officials within the employee's chain of command or designated by the agency for receiving such disclosures. PPD-19 protects Intelligence Community whistleblowers from reprisals for disclosing violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health or safety. It prohibits reprisals that could impact access to classified information or involve personnel actions against the whistleblower. IC elements must certify a process for employees to seek review of retaliatory personnel actions. PPD-19 requires IC elements to certify a process for employees to seek review of personnel actions believed to be in reprisal for lawful disclosures. The IC Inspector General determines if reprisal occurred and recommends corrective actions, which the agency head considers but is not obligated to accept. Agencies must also certify a review process for employees to appeal actions related to access to classified information. PPD-19 allows for whistleblower appeals through an IG panel, with agency heads not required to accept recommendations for corrective action. The IGIC reports annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Training is mandated for employees with access to classified information. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against reprisal for protected disclosures, including disclosures to designated officials. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against reprisal for lawful disclosures, including to designated officials and congressional intelligence committees. It defines lawful disclosure as reporting violations of federal law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. Contractors are not specifically mentioned in the legislation. Section 602 of Title VI of the FY2014 IAA protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It also requires the development of appeal policies for whistleblower cases. The provision does not allow for judicial review or a private right of action and does not mention contractors. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, signed in 2014 and updated in 2016, provides guidance for PPD-19. It includes protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures, appeals for security clearance decisions, and covers contractors and Armed Forces members. The provision in ICD-120 includes protections for IC employees, contractors, and Armed Forces members against reprisal for making lawful disclosures. It requires each IC element to have a review process for appeals on security clearance decisions. Employees alleging reprisal can request an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliation for protected communications. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliation for protected communications, allowing communication with various entities and participation in investigations involving Congress or an Inspector General. The curr_chunk specifies prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for a member of the Armed Forces making a protected communication, enables the DOD to mitigate hardship for an Armed Forces member following an alleged reprisal, requires periodic updates during investigations, and mandates uniform standards for investigations and training for Inspectors General staff. The curr_chunk discusses inconsistencies in whistleblower protection legislation for contractors in the intelligence community, with recent efforts by Congress to address gaps in coverage. This includes the passage of P.L. 115-118 in 2018 to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and provide protections for IC contractors. Congress passed P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018, amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 and S. 794 to provide protections for IC employees against discrimination for making protected disclosures. On March 18, 2015, Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 to extend protections for contractor employees on contracts with IC elements who make whistleblower complaints. Congress later passed P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018, amending the National Security Act to provide protections for IC contractor whistleblowers. Section 110 of the National Security Act of 1947 amended existing whistleblower protections to allow IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to specified entities, including the head of the contracting agency, inspector general, DNI, IGIC, and congressional intelligence committees. These protections mirror those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014, but previously did not include provisions for contractors. The amendment provides clear safeguards for IC contractors against retaliatory personnel actions. Section 110 of the National Security Act of 1947 amended whistleblower protections for IC contractors, allowing them to make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions. These protections cover a wide range of actions, including violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, and dangers to public health or safety. Contractors of the FBI, including those in the Intelligence Branch, are also covered by these protections. Section 110 of the National Security Act of 1947 amended whistleblower protections for IC contractors, allowing them to make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, including violations of federal laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. Contractors of the FBI, including those in the Intelligence Branch, are also covered by these protections. H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC, enhancing their ability to investigate fraud. The H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC. This funding supported hiring investigators and support staff to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse, enhancing the IGIC's capabilities to address whistleblower complaints."
