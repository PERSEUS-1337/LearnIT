    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the main title and findings of a section. The Act titled \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" highlights the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive health care for women throughout their lifetime. This includes care beyond the reproductive system, with 60 percent of office visits for preventive care. Obstetrician-gynecologists also reduce the need for referrals to other physicians, saving time and costs. Gynecologists provide preventive care and manage women's health beyond the reproductive system. They refer patients to other physicians less frequently, saving time and costs. Some states promote access to obstetrician-gynecologists, but patients in other states or federally-governed health plans may face access restrictions. SEC. 2. ASSURING ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. This section introduces standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services in group health plans and insurance coverage. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for coverage of obstetric and gynecologic care without prior authorization. Ordering gynecologic care by the obstetrician-gynecologist is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. Requirements for medical necessity and appropriateness still apply to coverage of gynecologic care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot deny women eligibility based on avoiding coverage requirements, offer incentives to accept less protection, or penalize providers for giving care in accordance with the section. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must not penalize providers for giving care in accordance with the section, comply with notice requirements, and can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. Group health plans and health insurance issuers can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers for care provided in accordance with the section. State laws that offer greater protections to enrollees than this section are not preempted. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 related to sections 2704 and 2706. These amendments are made to Subpart B of part 7 of the Act. SEC. 713. STANDARDS RELATING TO ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES. In connection with a group health plan, a female enrollee can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as her primary care provider without prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. The group health plan allows a female enrollee to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as her primary care provider for coverage of obstetric and gynecologic care without prior authorization. The plan also requires the ordering of other gynecologic care by the participating physician to be treated as prior authorization by the primary care provider. There are no waivers for coverage requirements related to medical necessity or appropriateness for gynecologic care. The group health plan must not deny women eligibility based on avoiding coverage requirements for gynecologic care. It is prohibited to offer monetary incentives to accept less coverage or penalize providers for giving care according to the plan. The group health plan cannot deny women eligibility based on coverage requirements for gynecologic care. Providers cannot be penalized for providing care in accordance with the plan. Imposition of the requirements is considered a material modification in the plan terms, requiring notice within 60 days. Nothing in this section can prevent the plan from determining the level and type of reimbursements. The group health plan cannot deny women eligibility for gynecologic care. Providers cannot be penalized for following the plan. Notice of any modifications must be given within 60 days. The plan can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees are not superseded by this section. The amendment continues to enforce additional protections for enrollees in group health insurance coverage, including changes to specific sections of the Act. Standards relating to access to obstetrical and gynecological services are outlined in the amendment to the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws that are more protective regarding health insurance issuers are not preempted. The section states that State laws providing greater protections for enrollees than federal law regarding health insurance issuers in group coverage are not preempted. Amendments are made to section 2762 of the Act, specifying effective dates for the changes. Amendments are made to section 2762 of the Act, specifying effective dates for changes in group health plans and health insurance coverage. The amendments apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998, and to individual market coverage on or after that date. Group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the Act's enactment have specific provisions regarding the application of the amendments. The amendments made by subsection (a) do not apply to plan years beginning before the later of the termination of collective bargaining agreements relating to the plan or January 1, 1998.
