    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section, SEC. 1260, in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding gains from constructive ownership transactions. The taxpayer's gain from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as short-term capital gain if it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. The capital gain rate applicable is based on the rates that would have applied to the net underlying long-term capital gain. An interest charge may apply if any gain is treated as short-term. The taxpayer's gain from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as short-term capital gain if it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. The capital gain rate applicable is based on the rates that would have applied to the net underlying long-term capital gain. An interest charge may apply if any gain is treated as short-term, increasing the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year. The taxpayer's gain from a constructive ownership transaction is subject to an interest charge if treated as short-term capital gain, increasing tax liability for the year. Any underpayments of tax for prior years due to this gain are calculated ratably. Any increase in tax cannot be used for determining tax credits or the tax imposed by section 55. Financial position is a key consideration for this section.

Any underpayments of tax for prior years due to this gain are calculated ratably. Any increase in tax cannot be used for determining tax credits or the tax imposed by section 55. Financial position is a key consideration for this section, defining positions related to stock, debt instruments, partnership interests, or investment trust interests. The taxpayer is treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction if they hold a long position under a notional principal contract, enter into a futures contract, are the grantor of a put and holder of a call with substantially equal strike prices, or engage in other transactions related to the same property. The taxpayer is considered to have engaged in a constructive ownership transaction if they hold a long position under a notional principal contract, enter into a futures contract, or participate in other transactions with substantially equal strike prices. This section does not apply if all positions in the transaction are marked to market. In a notional principal contract, a long position is held if the person has the right to receive investment yield and is obligated to reimburse any decline in value. The terms \"forward contract\" and \"related person\" are defined in specific sections. The term 'related person' is defined in section 1259(c)(4). In constructive ownership transactions, 'net underlying long-term capital gain' refers to the aggregate net capital gain based on deemed ownership. If no gains or losses result from the transaction, the gain is treated as zero. The net underlying long-term capital gain in constructive ownership transactions is considered zero unless proven otherwise. If a taxpayer elects the Mark to Market option, they must recognize gain or loss on open transactions as if the financial position was sold at fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year. The Mark to Market option requires recognizing gain or loss on open transactions at fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year. Any gain or loss from constructive ownership transactions is treated as ordinary income or loss. The Mark to Market option requires recognizing gain or loss on open transactions at fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year. Gain or loss from constructive ownership transactions before the close of the taxable year shall be treated as ordinary income or loss. An election under this rule can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and subsequent taxable years unless revoked. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this provision.
