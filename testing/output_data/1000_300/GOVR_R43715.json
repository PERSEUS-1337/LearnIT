Airlines need this insurance for aircraft loan agreements and to operate in certain countries. After 9/11, there was a global cancellation of war risk coverage, leading to increased costs. The U.S. government expanded the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. carriers could still get coverage. The U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to provide coverage for U.S. air carriers when the commercial market faced significant increases in war risk insurance costs. Private insurers now offer coverage for loss or damage to passengers and aircraft hulls in the event of a terrorist attack, but coverage for third-party damage caused by war or terrorism is limited. Airlines typically obtain liability and hull risk coverage from the same insurers in a single policy. The study found that airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion for basic insurance in 2011. Insurance prices vary depending on factors such as location, fleet age, safety record, and deductible levels. While the private market for aviation risk insurance is currently adequate, this could change in the event of a major terrorist incident. The private market for aviation risk insurance is currently adequate, but could be impacted by a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage to airlines, with availability and lower prices for non-war risk coverage in recent years. Airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to increased aviation insurance premiums. The aviation risk environment has been unsettled by recent losses, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, as well as attacks on airports. Some insurers predict a potential 50% increase in premiums and a tripling of war risk insurance premiums. However, it is still uncertain as major carriers have not renewed their policies yet. The uncertainty in the aviation risk environment following recent losses may lead to higher premiums for all-risk policies, including war risk insurance. The potential unavailability of private coverage could impact U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations due to regulatory requirements for aviation-specific liabilities. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates that carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory must have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. Overflights by non-EU air carriers or operators using aircraft registered outside the EU must have insurance against third-party liability. This regulation has made war risk insurance mandatory for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU. The federal government provided war risk insurance to the merchant fleet during World War I and World War II. Aviation war risk insurance was not available during these wars due to limited overseas commercial air operations. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance had 48-hour cancellation clauses, causing concerns for operators in the Korean War airlift. In 1951, a law was passed to allow the Secretary of Commerce to provide war risk insurance for air commerce when necessary for national defense. The Secretary of Commerce was given authority to provide war risk insurance for air commerce in the interest of national defense. Coverage could include U.S.- and foreign-flag aircraft, cargo, personal effects, baggage, and liabilities. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce, and a revolving fund was established to fund the insurance program. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established a revolving fund within the Treasury for war risk insurance in the aviation industry. The program allowed any authorized company to underwrite the insurance, with disputes resolved in federal court. Responsibility for the program was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. In 1966, responsibility for the aviation insurance program was delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation. The era of international terrorism began with hijackings in 1968 and 1969 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), leading to further attempts in 1970. The Dawson's Field hijackings occurred on September 6, 1970, involving the successful hijacking of three airliners. One hijacking attempt was foiled by an armed Israeli guard on an El Al Boeing 707. The hijacked Pan Am 747 was diverted to Beirut and Cairo, where a hijacker detonated an explosive upon landing in Cairo. All passengers managed to escape the resulting fire. The hijackers diverted the Pan Am 747 to Beirut and Cairo, where an explosive was detonated upon landing, destroying the jet. The commercial insurance industry was shaken, prompting federal action to maintain war risk insurance coverage in the Middle East. FAA expanded their war risk coverage following the Dawson Field hijackings. Following the Dawson Field hijackings, the FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage in response to growing concerns over terrorist hijackings. The government set the insurance rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, offered on a limited basis under the existing Aviation War Risk Insurance Program as an emergency response to the ongoing Middle East crisis. This new insurance was a temporary measure to cover hijacking and terrorist risks, mitigating the need for a long-term federal role in providing insurance. The federal government expanded aviation war risk insurance coverage in response to terrorist hijackings. A landmark 1973 court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed by hijackers in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard policy, not its war risk policies. The court defined \"act of war\" as an operation for military advantage, narrowing the definition of war to combatants with significant sovereignty attributes. The decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which noted that small terrorist groups lacked sovereignty and political power. The appellate court ruled that small terrorist groups lacked sovereignty and political power, making insurers liable for claims on destroyed aircraft. Prior to 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. In the 1990s, over 99% of war risk insurance issued by FAA for DOD charter flights was without premiums. Premium insurance was only provided for specific foreign policy interests, such as during the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. Airlines began cancelling flights to the Middle East due to high commercial war risk insurance rates before Operation Desert Storm in January 1991. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, air carriers started cancelling flights to the Middle East in response to soaring war risk insurance rates. Premiums for flights to Israel increased twentyfold to $125,000 per flight. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights to high-risk locations like Israel, Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. During the first Gulf War, air carriers canceled flights to high-risk locations like Israel, Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi due to soaring war risk insurance rates. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. After the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers canceled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines, leading to increased premiums. Congress responded by passing the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-42) amended the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) extended the program, which has been renewed multiple times, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). The current program authority expires on September 30, 2014. P.L. 107-296 expanded coverage to include losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at limits carried by air carriers. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was amended by P.L. 107-296 to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at limits carried by air carriers. The rates were set to match commercial rates in force on November 25, 2002, with the total premium not exceeding twice the premium paid to the Department of Homeland Security. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, amended by P.L. 107-296, capped rates to match commercial rates in force on November 25, 2002. Coverage would start from the first dollar of any covered loss. Congress also passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to address terrorism damage insurance issues post-9/11 attacks. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) created a reinsurance program for terrorism losses in commercial property/casualty insurance. Airlines leaving the FAA program may still be covered under TRIA. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers 44 U.S. air carriers with insurance ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. Premiums are collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, which had a balance of $2.2 billion as of July 31, 2014. 17 carriers switched to commercial coverage between April and August 2014, leaving 27 carriers insured by the FAA with coverage ranging from $100 million to $3 billion per occurrence. The FAA currently insures 27 air carriers, covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. The total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Premium collections during FY2015 are estimated to be $18 million, assuming Congress extends the existing program through FY2015. By statute, the coverage offered under the program begins with the first dollar of loss and reimburses 100%. Premium collections during FY2015 are estimated to be $18 million by the FAA, assuming Congress extends the existing program and no air carriers cancel their policies. The coverage includes hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability, with no deductibles or coinsurance. The term \"war risk occurrence\" encompasses various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The policy excludes coverage for various risks such as warlike hostilities, civil war, rebellion, terrorism, sabotage, and confiscation by foreign governments. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered. The policy excludes coverage for acts of sabotage, vandalism, confiscation by foreign governments, hijacking, and the discharge of weapons or explosives on the aircraft. The policy excludes coverage for acts of sabotage, vandalism, confiscation by foreign governments, hijacking, and the discharge of weapons or explosives on the aircraft. FAA bases premiums on risk assumed by the program, with a cap limiting premiums to no more than twice what air carriers were paying for third party policies in 2002. The program administration requires a small number of people, with four civilian full-time equivalent positions associated with the aviation war risk revolving fund in the FAA FY2014 budget justification. No claims were paid under the FAA. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program has paid over $10 million for losses related to claims from specific incidents since 9/11. These incidents were classified as \"war risk occurrences\" by the Secretary of Transportation. One incident involved an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, with claims totaling $205,600. Another incident in 2012 saw an unattended SkyWest aircraft seized by a fugitive, resulting in claims being filed with the FAA. In July 2012, an unattended SkyWest aircraft was seized by a fugitive who caused damage to airport facilities and personal vehicles before taking his own life. Claims paid to date total $9.6 million. In April 2014, FAA paid claims of $256,890 for repair of damage to an insured Boeing 767-223 aircraft allegedly caused by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a reform to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program in response to aircraft damage caused by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The proposal aims to provide war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons, offer full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days during market disruptions, and continue non-premium war risk insurance for carriers under Department of Defense contracts. The proposal aims to provide war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons, offer full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days during market disruptions, and continue non-premium war risk insurance for carriers under Department of Defense contracts. Additionally, there was a previous proposal in the President's FY2014 budget to shift 80% of the war risk insurance market to commercial insurers by FY2018. The FY2014 budget proposed shifting 80% of the war risk insurance market to commercial insurers by FY2018. The airline industry has opposed changes to the program, arguing that commercial insurance would be too costly. A4A President Nicholas E. Calio criticized the FY2014 budget for ending the War Risk Insurance program, stating it would harm the U.S. airline industry economically. A4A recommended maintaining the program for three more years. The Secretary of Transportation's March 2014 proposal argued against extending the current program due to budget concerns. The Senate proposed in March 2014 to end the War Risk Insurance program due to budget concerns, citing a cost of over $1 billion over 10 years. Ways to reduce costs include increasing premiums or seeking higher returns on funds, and reducing assumed risks to lower payouts. Premiums collected by the FAA totaled $165 million in FY2013. The FAA collected $165 million in premiums in FY2013. Increasing the statutory cap could raise premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies. Insurers invest premiums until claims are paid. Airlines with low risk profiles may seek private insurance or operate with less coverage if premiums increase. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical lows. Private insurers invest in a wider range of instruments, yielding higher returns than Treasury securities. Total net investment income for private insurers was $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in cash and investments in 2013. Private insurers invest in a wide range of instruments, historically yielding higher returns than U.S. Treasury securities. In 2013, private property/casualty insurers earned $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in investments. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently invested in Treasury securities, could have earned $91 million instead of $26 million in FY2013 with a similar return. Private insurance policies involve risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance to mitigate losses and discourage risky behavior. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program offers coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance since 2002, covering losses up to maximum limits. It also includes coverage for non-war risks like vandalism or labor disturbances. Placing more risk on airlines could lead to budgetary savings, depending on implemented changes. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers war risks and non-war risks like vandalism or labor disturbances. Placing more risk on airlines could result in budgetary savings, with potential significant savings achievable through risk sharing among insurers. Reinsurance is often used to spread risk among insurers, with contractual arrangements tailored to achieve desired risk sharing. Loss sharing typically occurs as a certain percentage of the loss or at a certain level of loss. Insurance or reinsurance contracts can be tailored for risk sharing among companies. Loss sharing may be a percentage of the loss or at a certain level. Parties may have expertise in different areas, allowing them to draw on strengths effectively. Sharing risk is not only for financial reasons but also for utilizing expertise and capacity. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a loss-sharing program where insurers benefit from sharing risks based on expertise and capital levels. The program starts covering losses at 20% of premiums, with the government covering 85%. The minimum losses for government coverage have increased over time, reducing the government's share of future losses. The program was intended to expire quickly, but has been reauthorized. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) program has seen an increase in applications, leading to a gradual decrease in the government's share of future losses. Improved international guidance on risk decisions for flights in conflict zones could impact private market war risk insurance. After the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in 2014, there is a focus on disseminating threat information for civilian flight operations in high-risk regions. Insurance underwriters are reassessing coverage for aircraft in these areas. Insurance underwriters are reviewing coverage for aircraft in conflict zones, considering withdrawing coverage in certain areas in the Middle East and Africa due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been involved in discussions on disseminating threat information and making informed decisions for civilian flight operations in high-risk regions. Airlines have been criticized for flying over conflict zones to save costs, a practice questioned after the Malaysia Airlines crash in 2014. In August 2014, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convened a task force to assess conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft. Countries are required to identify conflict zones, assess hazards, and establish policies to avoid risks. However, not all countries share information or take necessary precautions to protect civil aviation. In practice, countries may not always share information about conflict risks to civil aviation or take adequate precautions to mitigate risks to aircraft. This can lead to disparate views on risk and precautions among regulators, airlines, and insurers. For example, in July 2014, FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict after a rocket exploded near Ben Gurion Airport. In July 2014, FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict after a rocket exploded near Ben Gurion Airport. This prompted Israeli authorities to ask international air carriers to resume flights, highlighting the challenges of disseminating warnings and restrictions that may impact travel and tourism. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation are needed. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation, issuing warnings, and restricting flights could address concerns over private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage by potentially reducing uncertainties and ambiguities in assessing risk. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. Minimum insurance coverage of 250,000 SDRs is mandated. The insurance liability requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators include coverage for passengers, baggage, cargo, and third parties. Minimum coverage of 250,000 SDRs per passenger is mandated for passenger liability, higher than the Montreal Convention's requirement. Non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg have a lower minimum coverage of 100,000 SDRs per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs per passenger, and cargo liability requires 19 SDRs per kilogram in commercial operations. Third-party liability insurance is also specified. The minimum insurance coverage required for air carriers includes 1,131 SDRs per passenger for commercial operations and 19 SDRs per kilogram for cargo liability. The minimum coverage per accident varies based on the MTOM of the aircraft, ranging from 750,000 SDRs to 700 million SDRs. Sanctions for non-compliance with the regulation can include the withdrawal of operating licenses and refusal of landing rights. The federal government provides insurance programs similar to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, such as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program created after 9/11. Insurers excluded terrorism coverage, leading to the need for specialized insurance programs. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was established in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when the private sector was unwilling or unable to offer coverage. Initially authorized for three years, the program has been reauthorized multiple times due to the insurance industry's reluctance to cover terrorism risk. Several bills have been introduced to extend the program further as the 2014 expiration date approaches. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was established in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks. The program has been reauthorized multiple times, with the insurance industry supporting an extension. TRIA does not directly cover businesses at risk of terrorism losses but provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific commercial property/casualty coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) offers federal coverage for losses due to terrorism through private insurers. The program reimburses insurers for some losses, with no upfront premiums but a post-event recoupment fee. Coverage is limited compared to federal aviation war risk insurance. Losses covered by TRIA are paid from the government's general fund. TRIA coverage is limited compared to federal aviation war risk insurance. Private insurers administer TRIA, with limits and deductibles from the private insurance policy also applying to TRIA coverage. A minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act is required for federal funds to flow under TRIA. The acts certified for this threshold are narrower than those triggering federal aviation war risk insurance. There are no federal limits on terrorism coverage costs under TRIA. The criteria for triggering federal aviation war risk insurance are broader than those for counting towards the $100 million threshold under TRIA. While there are no federal limits on terrorism coverage costs under TRIA, state laws may regulate terrorism premiums."
