    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Civil Rights Center and Museum Commemorative Coin Act.\" The Congress acknowledges the significance of the Greensboro sit-in of 1960, which sparked nonviolent protests against segregation across the US. Over 70,000 people participated in similar demonstrations by 1961 in over 60 cities. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, located at the site of the original sit-in, serves as an educational facility and archive. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, located at the site of the original sit-in, will open on February 1, 2010, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the sit-in movement. It will serve as an archival center and teaching facility exploring the international struggle for civil and human rights. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $1 silver coins in commemoration of the opening of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins minted under this Act will symbolize the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, with specific design requirements including inscriptions of the year \"2010\" and words like \"Liberty\" and \"In God We Trust\".
