    "content": "The changing structure of U.S. agriculture has raised concerns about reduced competition in various agricultural markets, including dairy. The dairy industry faces issues of consolidation and industry concentration. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice will hold workshops to address competition issues in agriculture. A workshop on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry and discusses recent financial stress for dairy farmers. The report on the U.S. dairy industry in Madison, WI on June 25, 2010, discusses financial stress for dairy farmers, movements in farm and retail prices, industry consolidation, economic effects, and antitrust law. In 2009, federal programs spent over $1 billion to support the industry due to lower milk prices. In 2009, the dairy industry faced financial stress due to lower milk prices, leading to federal support programs totaling over $1 billion. Congress granted an additional $350 million in October 2009 for supplemental payments and government purchases of dairy products. Despite this assistance, the number of U.S. dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 farms by December 31, 2009. Milk production also declined, but a rebound in foreign demand for dairy products increased average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Financial stress in the dairy sector in 2009 led to a decline in dairy farms and milk production. Despite a rebound in foreign demand for dairy products, dairy farmers faced challenges with high feed prices. The industry and Congress are considering options to manage fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years due to advancements in milk marketing and government intervention. Congress is considering options to manage fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers, while also examining issues of consolidation and concentration in the industry. The early history of the dairy industry was shaped by government intervention and the growth of urban areas. Producers formed cooperative associations to bargain with milk handlers, leading to the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 providing limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives. By 1925, handlers were paying farmers based on milk use. During the Great Depression, demand for milk dropped sharply, causing the breakdown of the classified pricing system. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market and equalize the market power of dairy farmers with processors. Import quotas on dairy products were also enacted to ensure consumers had a reliable supply of milk at reasonable prices. During World War II, demand for farm commodities, including milk, increased. In the late 1940s, the government supported milk prices through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. Additional programs such as the Dairy Export Incentives Program and Milk Income Loss Contract were added to national dairy policy in later years. For more information on dairy programs, refer to CRS Report R40205, Dairy Market and Policy Issues. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. In the early 20th century, raw milk was transported to processing plants by truck or rail, with milk primarily bottled for home delivery. Home delivery characterized fluid milk marketing for decades, emphasizing the historical local production and consumption of milk. Advancements in milk marketing in the U.S. led to a shift from home delivery to retail sales in stores, facilitated by improved transportation infrastructure. This transition to a national market for milk and dairy products was driven by factors like the interstate highway system and larger tanker trucks for bulk transport. Retail milk is now primarily sold in lightweight containers, with bulk milk being shipped long distances to meet market demands. Dairy manufacturing plants also ship products like cheese and yogurt nationwide. The dairy industry has evolved from home delivery to retail sales in stores, with milk now primarily sold in lightweight containers. Bulk milk is shipped long distances to meet market demands, and dairy manufacturing plants distribute products like cheese and yogurt nationwide. There is a concern about the relationship between farm and retail prices, with some questioning if processors and retailers are contributing to economic stress for dairy farmers. In recent decades, the farm share of the retail food dollar has declined across the agricultural sector, including dairy products. Factors such as increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing have contributed to this decrease. In 1950, the farm share was 41%, but by 2006, it had dropped to 18.5%. The remaining percentage is attributed to various marketing factors like labor, packaging, profit, transportation, and energy. The USDA estimated that the average farm-value share of U.S. farm-origin food consumed was 18.5%, with the remaining 81.5% accounted for by marketing factors. The farm share for milk and dairy products is about one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average due to lower processing. The trend for milk and dairy products remained generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with slight variations in farm-share for different products. The farm-share trend for whole milk, butter, and ice cream remained flat, while there was a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. From July 2008 to December 2008, the farm price of milk fell by $0.33 per gallon, leading to a widening marketing margin. In January 2009, the difference between retail and farm milk prices reached a record-high of $2.43 per gallon. However, in 2009, retailers reduced prices due to lower costs, resulting in a decline in the difference to $1.69 per gallon. In 2009, retailers reduced milk prices due to lower costs, leading to a decline in the difference between farm and retail prices. The price spread dropped to $1.69 per gallon in December, below the recent five-year average margin. Retail prices respond slowly to farm price changes, with adjustments to higher farm prices happening faster than decreases. Retail prices adjust faster and more completely to increases in farm prices than to decreases, a phenomenon known as \"sticky\" retail food prices. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management can limit downward adjustments in retail prices. Competition effects of supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers. Recent economic research has shown that supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to a disconnect between farm and retail prices of agricultural products. Consolidation in the agriculture industry has resulted in fewer and larger operations, reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. Consolidation in the agriculture industry has led to fewer and larger operations along the production and marketing chain, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. This has led to a decline in the number of dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Firm size is a limiting factor for growth once economies of scale have been maximized. Operations at the farm, cooperative, and processor levels continue to decline, offsetting potential market power of large retailers. Concentration in the dairy industry has increased over time, with a sharp reduction in the number of dairy farms due to increased output and advances in technology. The annual drop in dairy farm operations has slowed in recent years, with operations totaling 65,000 in 2009. Despite the decline in farms, productivity has increased, resulting in a steady upward trend in total milk production. The drop in dairy farm operations has slowed to about 2,000 to 5,000 farms per year, totaling 65,000 in 2009. Productivity increases have offset declines in farm numbers, leading to a steady rise in milk production. Domestic milk demand has grown slowly, while cheese consumption has increased. Exports of dairy products have reached record levels. Farms with fewer than 500 cows decreased, while those with 1,000 or more cows increased by 20% due to lower production costs. In 2005-2009, dairy farms with fewer than 500 cows declined, while those with 1,000+ cows increased by 20% due to lower production costs. Large farms (1,000+ cows) produced 47% of U.S. milk output in 2009, up from 35% in 2005. In 2009, large dairy farms with 1,000+ cows accounted for 47% of U.S. milk output, up from 35% in 2005. These farms benefit from scale economies, modern facilities, and automated systems, leading to lower production costs and more efficient operations. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger farms and Wisconsin having many small farms. The average farm size varies by state in the dairy industry. Western states like California have large farms with 850 cows per farm, while Wisconsin has smaller farms with an average of 88 cows. Operating costs are affected by feed prices, with large farms in the west facing high costs due to purchasing feed. In contrast, farms in Wisconsin that produce their own feed have lower operating costs. Dairy cooperatives, owned and operated by farmers, manage milk distribution and product manufacturing. The number of cooperatives has decreased since the 1940s as they merged for economic benefits. In Wisconsin, farms with fewer cows have higher overhead costs, but lower operating costs when grain and feed prices rise. The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s, with consolidations and strategic alliances enabling them to serve large retail customers. By 2008, 79% of the milk produced in the United States was marketed by the 50 largest dairy cooperatives. In 2008, 79% of US milk was marketed by the top 50 dairy cooperatives, with the top four firms accounting for 40% of production. The National Milk Producers Federation highlights the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act for farmers to cooperate and improve bargaining power with milk handlers. The Capper-Volstead Act allows farmers to form cooperatives to improve their bargaining power with milk handlers and remain independent producers. Some producers believe cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry includes processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese. Recent decades have seen changes in demand, technological advancements, and plant sizes affecting dairy processors and manufacturers. In recent decades, changes in demand and technology have impacted dairy processors and manufacturers. The number of dairy firms has decreased, with larger plant sizes to meet the needs of high-volume retailers and large restaurant chains. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the US has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry mirror those in other food processing sectors. In 2002, the dairy processing industry had a four-firm concentration ratio of 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing. Compared to other food processing industries, dairy processing was less concentrated. However, local or regional markets could be more concentrated, raising concerns for farmers and policymakers. The level of industry concentration in dairy processing varies, with fluid milk processing just below the average level for selected food manufacturing industries. The retail sector for food products has seen significant changes due to price competition from nontraditional food retailers. The retail sector for food products has undergone substantial changes in recent years, with nontraditional food retailers like discount stores and supercenters causing traditional supermarkets to adjust pricing and product strategies. This has led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry, with the top four firms accounting for 36% of national sales by 2005. This concentration has implications for food product suppliers negotiating sales terms with retailers. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm concentration shares ranging from 63% to 85% in specific market areas. This high concentration means fewer choices for consumers among food stores at the individual level. The dairy industry has seen an increase in consolidation and market concentration, with dairy processors and manufacturers growing in size and market share to meet demands from food retailers for lower costs. Concerns about concentration include reduced competition and market power, potentially disadvantaging producers or consumers. However, concentration may also lead to efficiency improvements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing segment of the beef, pork, or dairy sectors, or the retail sector overall, may not adversely affect agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Most studies reviewed by GAO showed no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. The GAO found that concentration in the beef, pork, or dairy sectors, or the retail sector overall may not adversely affect agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Most studies reviewed showed no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. Experts predict concentration will increase in the future, potentially raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. Further increases in concentration could generate efficiency gains and be beneficial. Concentration in dairy processing had little impact on commodity or food prices, with efficiency benefits outweighing market power effects in some studies. The GAO found that concentration in dairy processing had little impact on commodity or food prices. Efficiency benefits were greater than market power effects, and market power of dairy processors could be offset by dairy cooperatives. Studies on regional retail milk markets suggested evidence of market power, with noncompetitive behavior in some metropolitan markets. The GAO found that concentration in dairy processing had little impact on commodity or food prices. Studies on regional retail milk markets suggested evidence of market power among retailers, leading to concerns about price transparency and potential consolidation in the industry. Concentration in the dairy industry affects price transparency in markets for dairy products and milk. Fewer transactions due to fewer buyers and sellers weaken market \"discovery\" of prices. The move towards a more integrated market with custom contracts results in fewer trades on the spot market, impacting price information. The primary spot market for dairy is at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The primary spot market for dairy products is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where prices are determined by buyers and sellers. However, some dairy producer groups believe that the CME is an inadequate pricing mechanism due to concerns about thin trading, lack of transparency, and market volatility. This market sets wholesale prices that are used to establish monthly minimum prices for farm milk under federal orders by the USDA. Some dairy producer groups criticize the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as an inadequate pricing mechanism due to thin trading, lack of transparency, and market volatility. The GAO found in a 2007 study that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants claim any manipulation would be short-lived as they monitor the market closely and are prepared to counteract any price discrepancies. Many large participants in the cheese and dairy industry closely monitor the market for any signs of price manipulation. In 2008, some industry participants were penalized for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through purchases of cheese on the CME in 2004. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for manipulation. The CME recently introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder to manage international dairy risk. In 2008, some industry participants were penalized for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through purchases of cheese on the CME in 2004. The CME recently announced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as an international dairy risk management tool. Some producers and policymakers aim to enhance dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's mandatory price reporting system for dairy products. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. U.S. antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, focus on competition in markets and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. These laws are enforced by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, and individuals can also allege economic injury from violations. The Sherman Act specifically prohibits concerted activity that restrains trade. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act prohibit anti-competitive conduct in economic transactions. The Sherman Act prohibits agreements among firms not to compete, while the Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition. Violations can result in fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations, or imprisonment up to 10 years. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition, with premerger notification allowing antitrust agencies to review transactions before completion. The \"Merger Guidelines\" are being updated to reflect current practices, with potential remedies including legal action to stop mergers or conditioning approval on modifications. The premerger remedies DOJ/FTC might seek for proposed mergers include legal action to stop the merger or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption for farmer cooperatives in agriculture. The Capper-Volstead Act grants antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. In 2009, Dean Foods acquired two plants from Foremost Farms, leading to a civil antitrust suit by the DOJ in 2010. The DOJ and several states filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods for acquiring plants from Foremost Farms, alleging a violation of the Clayton Act. The acquisition eliminated competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains in certain states. This led to a decrease in competition and hurt school milk and fluid milk purchases. Prior to the acquisition, Foremost Farms had been losing customers to other processors due to their inability to deliver milk to distant locations. The lawsuit against Dean Foods alleges a violation of the Clayton Act by eliminating competition in the market for school milk and fluid milk purchases. Dean Foods now holds a majority market share in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and upper Michigan. The company defends the acquisition, stating it benefits dairy farmers and consumers by providing cost savings and competition in the region. The acquisition by Dean Foods is believed to comply with antitrust laws and benefit dairy farmers by providing a stable outlet for their milk. The deal has resulted in cost savings for consumers and increased competition in the region. A class action antitrust complaint was filed against major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America. A class action antitrust complaint was filed on October 8, 2009, against major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges a conspiracy to control the supply of fluid milk in the region, leading to lower prices for farmers. The milk marketing system, once dominated by family-owned processors, has now shifted to affiliations with larger corporations. The lawsuit alleges that dairy producers must now affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood, leading to detrimental effects on independent producers and cooperatives in the Northeast. DFA claims to increase returns for farmers through cost-saving efficiencies and denies suppressing prices. Observers predict a lengthy legal process for resolution. The cooperative aims to increase producer returns by implementing cost-saving efficiencies in field services, hauling, and administration. Litigation involving multiple class action lawsuits against dairy companies like Dean Foods and DFA may take years to resolve. Determining the net effect of market concentration on prices is complex due to various factors influencing market power and efficiency gains. Market power and efficiency gains in the dairy industry are influenced by factors like product differentiation, market entry ease, technology changes, and government policies. Commodity prices are also affected by economic events, making it challenging to isolate the effects of market concentration."
