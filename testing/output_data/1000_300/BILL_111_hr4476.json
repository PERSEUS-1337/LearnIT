    "content": "The Act titled \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\" is cited as the short title. Congressional findings are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but publicly chartered government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the deepest economic decline since World War II and the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. In 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA placed the GSEs in conservatorship, a form of nationalization. In 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship. The government established a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock in the enterprises to cover losses, which was later raised to $400 billion in 2009. In 2009, the Obama Administration removed limits on the use of Federal funds to cover losses, resulting in over $110 billion in taxpayer funds being spent on senior preferred stock in the two enterprises. The government's actions have led to taxpayers owning at least 80% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are now used as instruments of Federal housing policy. The Congressional Budget Office considers them government entities, expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political factors. At the end of 2009, the Treasury Department and the FHFA approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including $2,000,000 in incentive pay each, which is significantly higher than the annual compensation of the President and a Cabinet Secretary. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved multi-million dollar compensation packages for top executives of the GSEs, payable in cash instead of stock options. FHFA determined no cash bonuses or long-term incentives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives in 2008. FHFA's five-year Strategic Plan includes a commitment to safe and sound operations for the GSEs. The FHFA's Strategic Plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac emphasizes safe and sound operations. Section 1318(c) of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act allows the Director of FHFA to withhold executive compensation for review. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, a new compensation system will be established based on government pay rates. Additionally, there is a provision for clawback of 2009 compensation for executive officers. The government will claw back 2009 compensation from executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that exceeded the authorized pay rate, with the funds being used to reduce the national debt."
