    "content": "North Korea's development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, along with illicit activities, has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy. Despite efforts since the 1990s, including negotiations and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities continue to grow. The U.S. has never had formal diplomatic relations with North Korea, but its interests in the region include security, political, and human rights concerns. The U.S. is obligated to defend its allies, South Korea and Japan, from any attack. The U.S. has security, political, and human rights concerns regarding North Korea's increasing capabilities. Military alliances with South Korea and Japan require the U.S. to defend them from any North Korean attack. North Korea's nuclear and missile advancements pose a threat to U.S. troops and civilians in the region. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program impact U.S. relations with major powers like China and South Korea. The collapse of the government in Pyongyang would have severe implications for the regional and global economy. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program influence U.S. relations with major powers in the region, especially China and South Korea. North Korea, with a population of about 25 million, was founded on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance) and is controlled by the Kim family, enabling it to resist outside influences and break diplomatic agreements. The Kim family's totalitarian control in North Korea has allowed the country to resist outside influences, build a large military as a deterrent, and extract concessions from foreign powers. However, this militarization, along with provocative behavior and isolationist policies, has hindered economic growth. North Korea's economic growth has been severely stunted by its isolationist policies and provocative behavior. Despite indications of a strengthening economy under Kim's leadership, most of the population remains deeply impoverished. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation, the North Korean Human Rights Act, and oversight of nuclear agreements. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. Congress has conducted numerous hearings on North Korea's capabilities, intentions, human rights record, and sanctions evasion. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is almost able to strike the US with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top US foreign policy and national security concern. Pyongyang's threats have increased in various domains, including nuclear weapons, missile technology, submarine-based missiles, artillery, and cyberattacks. North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests and missile tests in 2016 and 2017, with the latest being its most powerful nuclear test to date. Satellite imagery suggests that North Korea is developing its submarine-based ballistic missile program. In 2017, North Korea conducted missile tests showing potential to reach the US. Satellite imagery indicates development of submarine-based ballistic missiles. Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack. Response included a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures. The Trump Administration employed a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, leading the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions against North Korea. This included ratcheting up economic pressure, persuading China and other countries to apply more pressure, and expanding U.S. alliances to counter North Korean threats. Countries around the globe were pushed to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. The Trump Administration pushed for global countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements, emphasizing the option of a preventive military strike. There have been contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of launching a strike against North Korea, causing confusion about U.S. policy. The United States is prepared to launch a preventive strike against North Korea, causing confusion about U.S. policy. North Korea accepted invitations to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics and meet with South Korean and Chinese leaders before the historic meeting with President Trump. Opinions vary on Kim's decision to adjust course. Kim met with Moon and Xi Jinping to pave the way for the unprecedented meeting between the U.S. and DPRK leaders. Reasons for Kim's diplomatic shift include harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, tough sanctions limiting North Korea's economy, Moon's outreach efforts, and Kim's confidence in his nuclear deterrent. Despite the reasons, Kim found willing counterparts in Moon, Xi, and Trump. On June 12, 2018, President Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and the future of U.S. relations with North Korea. Trump committed to providing security guarantees to North Korea, while Kim reaffirmed his commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The Singapore document acts as a statement of principles in areas such as normalization. The Singapore document outlines commitments in four key areas: normalization of bilateral relations, establishment of a lasting peace regime, complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and recovery of POW/MIA remains. The agreement does not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the US will suspend annual military exercises with South Korea. In a press conference following the summit, Trump announced the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises, calling them \"war games\" and \"provocative.\" This move, not reciprocated by Pyongyang, surprised South Korea and U.S. military commanders. Trump also expressed a desire to withdraw the approximately 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. The Defense Department later canceled the annual U.S.-South Korea \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises scheduled for August. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, although those were not made by the DPRK leader himself. The annual U.S.-South Korea \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises scheduled for August were cancelled. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, but critics pointed out the lack of a timeframe and verification mechanisms for denuclearization. The agreement also lacked commitment from Kim to dismantle the DPRK's ballistic missile program, leaving uncertainties about denuclearization, sequencing, and establishing a peace regime. Some analysts believe the regime is seeking a peace treaty ending the Korean War as a precondition. The uncertainty surrounding denuclearization, peace regime establishment, and normalization of diplomatic ties with North Korea persists. Some analysts suspect the regime's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Maintaining sanctions pressure on North Korea remains challenging amidst engagement efforts, with U.N. sanctions being a crucial tool in holding the regime accountable for its weapons programs. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted resolutions imposing sanctions on North Korea for its weapons programs. A total of 10 resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for member states to halt interactions with North Korea. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted resolutions imposing sanctions on North Korea for its weapons programs. A total of 10 resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for member states to halt interactions with North Korea. The sanctions targeted arms sales, materials aiding North Korea's WMD programs, entities involved in WMD activities, luxury goods transfers, and expanded to ban financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and interactions with North Korean entities and workers. The Obama and Trump Administrations, along with the UNSC, imposed sanctions on North Korea, banning major exports like coal, agriculture products, seafood, textiles, and weapons. The value of North Korean exports declined by over 30% in 2017. Countries globally were urged to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. It is uncertain if the Trump Administration has continued this aggressive approach post diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang in 2018. The US, under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, imposed sanctions on North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. Congress passed North Korea-specific statutes, including the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 and the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act. The US has imposed sanctions on North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. Congress passed two North Korea-specific statutes, limiting trade to humanitarian goods, prohibiting financial transactions, new investments, and giving the President authority to prohibit certain transactions. US foreign aid is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent North Korea from benefiting. The US has imposed sanctions on North Korea to prohibit transactions in various sectors, restrict trade with designated entities, and limit travel to the country. North Korea's demands in negotiations for halting its weapons programs have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the US. Pyongyang's behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, such as missile tests and nuclear detonations. Negotiating with North Korea is complicated due to its changing tactics and internal conditions driving its willingness to engage. North Korea's negotiations for halting its weapons programs have varied, with demands including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the US. Pyongyang's behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, such as missile tests and nuclear detonations. North Korea's willingness to negotiate is often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation, seeking aid from China, the US, or South Korea. The country has exploited divisions among the parties and stalled negotiations during political transitions in Washington. Some analysts argue that negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict and are feasible, as Kim Jong-un's goal is economic development. Kim Jong-un's increased emphasis on economic development in 2018 is seen as a sign of potential denuclearization. Analysts believe negotiations with North Korea are necessary to reduce conflict and are feasible, with the possibility of a basic bargain for denuclearization in exchange for economic benefits and sanctions relief. Many analysts doubt North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing their demands as tactical moves for regime survival. Pyongyang's frequent statements reaffirming its commitment to its nuclear program cast doubt on the sincerity of its pledge at the Singapore summit. In 2010, North Korea reiterated its demand to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state. North Korea's determination to maintain its nuclear weapons program has led analysts to doubt the sincerity of its pledge at the Singapore summit. Despite international pressure, North Korea has reiterated its demand to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state and has declared that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable. The country has also successfully tested intercontinental ballistic missiles, solidifying its status as a nuclear-armed nation. North Korea's Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile test in November 2017 marked the completion of its state nuclear force. The country insists on keeping its nuclear stockpile until all nuclear weapons are eliminated globally. The 2011 military intervention in Libya, which gave up its nuclear program for sanctions removal, may have reinforced North Korea's belief in the security value of nuclear arms. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, with the U.S. President treating Kim as a world leader. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some of its past demands and engaging in formal nuclear and missile negotiations with the United States. The United States engaged in various formal nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, including the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The negotiations involved North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. North Korea's actions, such as starting a plutonium production reactor and obstructing inspections, led to tensions and threats of a preemptive military strike. In the early 1990s, North Korea obstructed IAEA inspections and announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT. A preemptive military strike was considered, but negotiations led to the 1994 Agreed Framework, where the US agreed to provide nuclear power plants and fuel oil in exchange for North Korea freezing its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. The Agreed Framework in 1994 involved the US providing power plants and fuel oil to North Korea in exchange for freezing its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. Despite delays, North Korea froze its program, received fuel oil, and started construction on the power plants. However, North Korea failed to declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA, leading to tensions in 2002 when the US suspected a secret uranium enrichment program. This resulted in the US halting fuel oil shipments and power plant construction. In response to suspicions of a secret uranium enrichment program, the US halted fuel oil shipments and power plant construction in North Korea. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility. The Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea to curb its missile program and exports, leading to a moratorium on long-range missile testing in exchange for lifting some US sanctions. In September 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on long-range missile testing in exchange for lifting some US sanctions. Talks continued, with a proposed agreement to end ballistic missile development and exports in exchange for international assistance in launching satellites. Despite efforts, a final agreement was not reached. Negotiations expanded under the George W. Bush Administration, involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia in the Six-Party Talks from 2003 to 2008, but failed to resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear arms. The Six-Party Talks involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia aimed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Despite occasional progress, the talks ultimately failed to address the fundamental issue of North Korean nuclear arms. A promising breakthrough in 2005 led to a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees. However, the process broke down due to disagreements on verifying North Korea's compliance. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" focused on pressuring Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and commit to steps towards denuclearization. The policy involved coordinating with allies, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. US officials sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, but insisted on a freeze of nuclear activities and testing before negotiations. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and commit to steps towards denuclearization. The policy involved coordinating with allies, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. The US sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, but insisted on a freeze of nuclear activities and testing before negotiations. Additionally, multilateral sanctions were imposed by the UN, and the Obama Administration issued executive orders for additional unilateral sanctions targeting entities and individuals involved in illicit activities supporting North Korea's WMD programs. Following the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment attributed to North Korean hackers, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 to seize assets of DPRK officials involved in illicit activities. Despite efforts for engagement, provocations by Pyongyang led to a cycle of action and reaction, with the US focusing on UNSC consensus and multilateral sanctions. Exceptions to this pattern occurred in February 2012 after Kim's death. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment at Yongbyon in exchange for US assistance. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a rocket and conducting a nuclear test in 2013. The US policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner and provider of essential aid. China prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse, despite not supporting its nuclear goals. China's overriding priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. Beijing sees strategic value in having North Korea as a buffer between China and democratic, U.S.-allied South Korea, often hindering U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international fora. Chinese companies have been found to violate sanctions against North Korea, and China's enforcement of sanctions has been uneven. China's enforcement of UNSC sanctions against North Korea has been inconsistent, with Chinese companies often violating sanctions. However, in 2017, China significantly increased its enforcement, possibly to deter a U.S. military strike. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited, as Beijing aims to appear responsible internationally. This influences the U.S. and South Korean approach to North Korea. Beijing's desire to appear responsible internationally influences its limited support for North Korea, leading the U.S. and South Korea to avoid pushing China to provide more assistance. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power, with Chinese academics calling for a reassessment of ties with North Korea. In 2017, China agreed to stringent UNSC sanctions resolutions and appeared to be implementing these measures. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 restored some closeness in the North Korea-China relationship. In 2018, Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts restored closeness in the North Korea-China relationship. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, traveled to Beijing to reaffirm a close relationship with China ahead of a meeting with Trump. Kim's achievements, including deescalation of hostilities and cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, likely earned him goodwill and leverage with Beijing. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, has consolidated power and gained leverage with Beijing. Analysts credit him with successfully pursuing a plan to ensure regime survival and improve the country's economy. His bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests a confident leader focused on strengthening North Korea. Kim Jong-un has consolidated power in North Korea, pursuing a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons. He has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent\" and improved relations with South Korea, China, and the United States. Despite initial hopes for political reform, Kim's behavior has not shown any signs of change. Kim Jong-un's ruthless drive to consolidate power in North Korea has been evident through brutal purges of officials and alleged involvement in assassinations. Despite initial hopes for political reform, Kim's actions demonstrate a strong desire to maintain the dynastic dictatorship. Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, has shown a different ruling style compared to his father, allowing Western influences and displaying a more informal demeanor in public appearances. His wife has been introduced to the public, but their children remain hidden. Analysts view these changes as Kim's attempt to appear young and modern. Kim Jong-un's wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, while their three children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as Kim's effort to appear youthful and modern, reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung. North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, has seen economic growth under Kim, with increased domestic production and access to consumer products for many citizens. Under Kim Jong-un's leadership, North Korea has experienced economic growth and improved living standards for many citizens through increased domestic production and access to consumer products. Market principles have been partially allowed to govern some sectors of business, industry, and agriculture, leading to the legalization of consumer and business-to-business markets and the expansion of ancillary services. Under Kim Jong-un's leadership, North Korea has seen economic growth and improved living standards through increased domestic production and access to consumer products. Market principles have been partially legalized, leading to an expansion in markets and ancillary services. International trade with China has played a significant role in North Korea's economy, accounting for over 90% of its trade. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have resulted in larger harvests since 2010. Food prices have been stable since around 2012, indicating increased stability in food production. Since 2010, North Korea has experienced larger harvests and stable food prices. Despite improvements for the elite, over 10 million North Koreans still face food insecurity. Analysts question the extent of Kim's economic reforms, as private enterprise is prohibited by the penal code. The government's stance on marketization remains unclear. North Korea's economic policies are similar to those of socialist countries, prohibiting private enterprise. The government cracks down on market activity and many citizens lack access to healthcare and face food shortages. The regime controls where families can live based on loyalty, with only the elite having access to better health facilities in Pyongyang. In Pyongyang, only the elite have access to better health facilities, while the regime controls where families can live based on loyalty. Few North Koreans can afford medical care or necessary medications, and the government tries to prevent citizens from accessing outside news sources. The North Korean government restricts access to foreign broadcasts, attempting to jam stations like VOA, RFA, and the BBC. Despite efforts to block outside news, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to listen to foreign programs. A 2015 survey found that 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts. North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in 2009, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. The regime allows increased mobile-phone use for surveillance purposes, and there are reports of North Korean officials consuming foreign media. The North Korean government restricts access to foreign broadcasts but some citizens have illegal radios to listen to them. North Korea has a mobile phone network with over 3 million subscribers in 2017, allowing for better surveillance opportunities. Reports suggest that North Korean officials consume foreign media and some are involved in smuggling. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls. The spread of cell phones enables faster dissemination of information, potentially leading to positive changes in the political system. 28% of North Koreans own domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media. Increased access to information in North Korea, including through mobile phones, could challenge the regime's control by informing citizens about their living conditions and encouraging them to question their government. Thae Yong-ho believes this could be the \"Achilles Heel\" of the Kim regime. North Korea's large military, estimated at 1.28 million personnel, has long been used to maintain loyalty to the Kim family and portray the outside world as inferior. North Korea's military is one of the largest in the world, with 1.28 million personnel and significant defense spending. They have deployed a majority of their forces near the DMZ for rapid deployment in conflict with South Korea. North Korea is developing WMD capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces, particularly focusing on nuclear weapons. North Korea is prioritizing the development of nuclear weapons, long-range ballistic missiles, and cyber warfare capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces. The U.S. intelligence community has identified North Korea as a significant cyber threat, with a large stockpile of chemical weapons and potential biological weapons. South Korea's Defense Ministry reports that North Korea has 6,000 cyber warfare troops. North Korea's conventional military capabilities have significantly declined since 1990, with antiquated weapons systems and inadequate training. Despite this, they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a war. Most of North Korea's major combat equipment is outdated and inferior to modern systems used by the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea's military equipment is old and inferior to the U.S. and South Korea. To compensate, they have focused on improving asymmetric capabilities like UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and electromagnetic pulse. Recent advancements include long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, UAVs, submarines, and special forces. North Korea has made advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, UAVs, surface-to-air missiles, submarines, and special operations forces. The military suffers from institutional weaknesses due to a highly centralized command structure, scripted war plans, and lack of training for mid-level officers. General resource scarcity affects military readiness. North Korea's war plans are inflexible and lack initiative from mid-level officers. Resource scarcity affects military readiness, with shortages of fuel, logistics, spare parts, and food. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development for deterrence and coercive diplomacy. Talks are ongoing for North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The U.S. intelligence community views North Korean nuclear weapons as for deterrence, prestige, and diplomacy. Talks with North Korea on denuclearization are met with skepticism. Pyongyang's commitment to nuclear weapons suggests they do not intend to negotiate them away. North Korea sees its nuclear arsenal as vital for deterring U.S. attacks. North Korean Foreign Ministry official Choe Son Hui stated in October 2017 that their nuclear arsenal is crucial for deterring US attacks. North Korea has conducted multiple nuclear tests, including a hydrogen bomb in September 2017, signaling a move towards deploying nuclear weapons. In early 2018, North Korea announced it had achieved its nuclear goals and would no longer pursue negotiations to give up their weapons. North Korea's nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. By 1986, they had a small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium. Despite announcing the closure of their test site in 2018, fissile material production continues. North Korea's nuclear program started in the late 1950s with cooperation from the Soviet Union on a research program near Yongbyon. By 1986, they had a small reactor producing plutonium. Despite announcing the closure of their test site in 2018, fissile material production continues. Since the collapse of the Six Party Talks in 2008, North Korea has restarted its 5MW(e) reactor, reprocessing plant, and uranium enrichment plant, with estimates of producing 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. North Korea's nuclear program began in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation near Yongbyon, leading to plutonium production by 1986. Despite announcing the closure of their test site in 2018, fissile material production continues. North Korea has restarted its 5MW(e) reactor, reprocessing plant, and uranium enrichment plant, estimated to have produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. The country is also constructing a new experimental light water reactor and an enrichment plant for weapons material. North Korea acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, claiming it is for nuclear power fuel production. In 2010, they displayed early construction of a light-water reactor and gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon, with the enrichment plant's operational status unconfirmed. U.S. officials suspect other clandestine activities. North Korea's nuclear program includes a 100 MWT light-water reactor and a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. The enrichment plant's operational status is unconfirmed, with suspicions of other clandestine facilities. Estimates suggest North Korea could produce 20 to 100 warheads by 2020, but lack of transparency hinders accurate stockpile assessments. North Korea prioritizes developing ballistic missile technology, conducting numerous test launches since 2011. In 2016, they had 26 ballistic missile tests, and in 2017, 18 tests were conducted, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea conducted 26 ballistic missile tests in 2016 and 18 tests in 2017, including suspected ICBM tests. They aim to develop a miniaturized nuclear warhead for long-range ballistic missiles. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to neighboring nations. North Korea's missile program poses a threat to neighboring nations, with assessments differing on progress in developing long-range ballistic missiles. Miniaturization for nuclear warheads may require further testing. The Nodong missile is a significant near-term threat, capable of reaching the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and some U.S. military bases. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of potential ICBMs, including the KN-08 and KN-14, with assessments suggesting initial steps towards fielding these systems. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of potential ICBMs, including the KN-08 and KN-14, with assessments suggesting initial steps towards fielding these systems. The DPRK conducted two ICBM tests in July 2017, and the Department of Defense recognized these tests but noted that additional testing may be required. North Korea has shown progress in its medium-range ballistic missile program and its submarine-launched ballistic missile test program, as well as a move towards solid rocket motors for its ballistic missiles. Successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 solid fuel MRBM in 2017 have led to further advancements in North Korea's missile capabilities. North Korea is focusing on developing solid fuel ballistic missiles to defeat missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Recent tests show a shift towards higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more challenging. Successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 solid fuel MRBM in 2017 have led to mass production of these missiles. North Korea's focus on developing solid fuel ballistic missiles aims to overcome missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Recent tests show a shift towards higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more challenging. Demonstrated ability for salvo attacks and progress with SLBMs suggest efforts to counter missile defenses by launching attacks from sea positions. North Korea's focus on developing solid fuel ballistic missiles aims to overcome missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Recent tests show a shift towards higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more challenging. Efforts with SLBMs suggest countering land-based THAAD defenses by launching attacks from sea positions. Previous attempts to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program were unsuccessful, with negotiations abandoned during the Bush Administration's focus on the North Korean nuclear program. Negotiations on North Korea's missile program were unsuccessful during the Bush Administration. UNSC resolutions imposed restrictions on North Korea's missile activities, but they continued testing. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests. Recent talks have not focused on missiles, despite North Korea's active biological and chemical weapons programs. U.S. reports indicate North Korea has a significant chemical weapons stockpile. North Korea has one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. They have approximately 12 facilities for producing and storing chemical weapons, with a production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense estimates their current inventory to be 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea has a significant chemical weapons stockpile, with a production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year and 12,000 tons during a crisis. They are not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and are suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons program. North Korea's biological weapons production capability is a serious concern, with the U.S. intelligence community judging that they have the infrastructure to support it. South Korea estimates that North Korea possesses anthrax and smallpox. Additionally, North Korea has proliferated WMD and missile-related technology to several countries, generating hard currency. North Korea has sold missile parts and technology to multiple countries, including Egypt, Iran, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, generating hard currency for the regime. They have also assisted Syria with a nuclear reactor, transferred chemical weapons-related materials to Syria, and cooperated with Iran on missile development since the 1980s. China may have also provided assistance to North Korea. The North Korean regime has engaged in illicit activities to earn hard currency, support its weapons programs, and protect its enterprises through a global network of entities. This includes involvement in the production and trafficking of illicit drugs. There are indications of collaboration between Iran's ballistic missile research centers and North Korea, as well as potential assistance from China in the North Korean missile program. The North Korean regime, through entities like Office 39, engages in illicit activities to earn foreign currency, including drug production and trafficking. These activities generate significant revenue, estimated between $500 million to $1 billion annually. In 2013, individuals were arrested for attempting to smuggle North Korean methamphetamines into the United States. North Korea engages in illicit activities like drug production and smuggling to earn foreign currency. In 2013, individuals were arrested for attempting to smuggle North Korean methamphetamines into the United States. The DPRK has also been involved in selling cheap Cold War-era weapons to states in the Middle East and North Africa, with a notable seizure of rocket-propelled grenades in 2016. It is unclear whether these activities are directed by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea engages in illicit activities like drug production and smuggling to earn foreign currency. In 2016, authorities seized a vessel outside the Suez Canal with over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Egyptian military. North Korea cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles and shipping weapons and equipment. The regime uses front companies based in China to mask its illicit dealings and access the international financial system. North Korean regime utilizes Chinese front companies to keep earnings in overseas bank accounts, avoiding repatriation to North Korea. These companies conduct transactions in U.S. dollars for sanctioned North Korean banks through multiple front companies. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies aiding North Korea, such as banning Bank of Dandong from the U.S. financial system for facilitating illicit financial activities. In November 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department banned Bank of Dandong, a Chinese bank, for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activity. Previously, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for criminal enterprises. $24 million in North Korean accounts with the bank were frozen, leading to a boycott of Six-Party Talks until the funds were returned. Past Administrations have highlighted North Korea's poor human rights record, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. The State Department's annual human rights reports also shed light on the dire situation faced by most North Koreans. The State Department's annual human rights reports and reports from private organizations have consistently highlighted North Korea's extreme human rights abuses. These include a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties, no freedoms of speech, press, or assembly, and severe physical abuse for violating laws. Reports also detail the extensive ideological indoctrination of North Korean citizens.
