This title authorized funding for research on agriculture-based renewable energy, aimed at reducing energy import dependence and promoting rural economic development. Interest in renewable energy has increased due to rising petroleum prices and growth in biofuels production. The 2008 farm bill reflects the increased role of biofuels in response to energy import dependence. Ethanol and biodiesel receive federal support through tax incentives and regulatory programs. The bill aligns with the expansion of the renewable fuels standard, aiming for 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) aims to boost biofuel production, particularly cellulosic ethanol, with a target of 36 billion gallons by 2022. This shift is driven by concerns over the economic and environmental impacts of corn starch-based ethanol. The increased use of corn for ethanol production has led to higher commodity prices, livestock feed costs, and food inflation, creating competition with petroleum in the market. The increased use of corn for ethanol production has led to higher commodity prices, livestock feed costs, and food inflation. Ethanol's profitability depends on petroleum and corn prices, with the \"food versus fuel\" debate intensifying during the 2008 farm bill debate. Several federal programs support renewable energy production and agriculture-based energy. Several federal programs outside the USDA support renewable energy production, including the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and federal tax credits for biofuel blenders. These programs originated from legislation such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The tax credits for biofuel blenders were initially included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and later extended in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The 2008 farm bill expanded programs to support biofuels production, including corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. Research provisions for renewable energy are in Title VII, while tax and trade provisions are in Title XV. The 2008 farm bill maintains the structure of Title IX from the Senate-passed version of the bill. The 2008 farm bill expanded support for biofuels production, including cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. Title IX contains key provisions such as a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit and grants for biofuels development. Sections 9002 and 9003 focus on studies and reports related to biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. The farm bill includes provisions for promoting cellulosic ethanol production, biofuels research grants, incentives for cellulosic ethanol feedstock production, and support for rural energy efficiency. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives and support for the production of advanced biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels. This includes grants and loan guarantees to leverage industry investments in new technologies and infrastructure. The bill also includes provisions for promoting the use and understanding of biodiesel, reducing tax credits for corn-based ethanol, and continuing import duties on ethanol. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) and Biorefinery Assistance program support the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks for advanced biofuels. Funding for advanced biofuels research is increased under various programs to promote research, extension, and development. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from structural material. The Sun Grant Program (Section 7526) supports advanced biofuels research using various feedstocks such as prairie grasses, fast-growing woody crops, and waste biomass materials. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plant material, offering long-term supply potential. Native prairie grasses like switchgrass are considered environmentally beneficial feedstock as they can thrive on marginal lands. Cellulosic ethanol, derived from various feedstocks like prairie grasses and agricultural residues, is not yet produced on a commercial scale. Limited production began in 2010, prompting the EPA to reduce RFS mandates for cellulosic biofuels from 2010 to 2012. The 2008 farm bill modified RFS mandates for cellulosic ethanol production from 2010 to 2012, with tax credits and tariffs on ethanol to promote investment in cellulosic ethanol production. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to the end of 2010 by the farm bill (P.L. 110-246, Section 15333) to protect the U.S. ethanol industry. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4853) extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff for ethanol at $0.45 per gallon and $0.54 per gallon, respectively. H.R. 4853 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff until the end of 2011 at $0.45 and $0.54 per gallon, respectively. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and consumer food prices. The farm bill includes provisions for reports assessing the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and consumer food prices. This includes studies on biofuels, biomass production, and economic impacts of biorefinery expansion. Over $1 billion in funding is authorized for FY2008 through FY2012. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for various programs related to biorefinery expansion and conversion, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, Biomass Research and Development Act, and potentially unlimited funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. Discretionary funding for energy-related provisions in the 2008 farm bill totals over $1.7 billion, a significant increase from previous years. The 2008 farm bill includes over $1.7 billion in discretionary funding for energy-related provisions, with a focus on the Biorefinery Assistance Program. Mandatory funding comes from USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, and programs are funded at authorized levels unless Congress intervenes. Table 2 outlines provisions and funding levels for selected energy programs from FY2010 to FY2012. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for energy programs with mandatory and discretionary funding levels for FY2010 through FY2012, as authorized by Congress."
