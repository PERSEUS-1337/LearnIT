Safety Act of 2007, mandates the consideration of rulemaking for power windows on motor vehicles to automatically reverse direction when detecting an obstruction to prevent injuries or fatalities. The Secretary must decide on safety standards for power windows to prevent injuries or deaths within 30 months of the Act's enactment. If no additional standards are deemed necessary, a report must be submitted to relevant committees and made public. The Secretary must initiate a rulemaking within 12 months to expand rearward visibility in vehicles to reduce injuries and deaths from backing incidents. Information on power windows and panels that automatically reverse direction in case of obstruction must be made public. The Secretary is required to revise FMVSS 111 to expand the driver's field of view behind the vehicle to reduce injuries and deaths from backing incidents, especially involving small children and disabled persons. This can be achieved through additional mirrors, sensors, cameras, or other technology. Final standards must be prescribed within 36 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will establish safety standards for expanding the driver's field of view within 36 months of the Act's enactment. Compliance with the standards must be achieved within 48 months of the final rule issuance. The phase-in period may vary for different types of motor vehicles based on data. The Secretary will establish safety standards for rearward visibility and consider phasing in different types of motor vehicles based on backing incident data. Motor vehicles with automatic transmission must have a system to prevent rolling away after September 1, 2010. Each motor vehicle with automatic transmission manufactured after September 1, 2010, must have a system that requires the brake to be depressed before shifting out of \"park\". Violation of this requirement is treated as a safety standard violation and enforced by the Secretary. Each motor vehicle manufacturer must submit information on noncompliant vehicles with automatic transmissions to the Secretary. The Secretary will then publish the make and model of these vehicles to the public. The Secretary will publish noncompliant motor vehicles' make and model to the public. The definition of a motor vehicle excludes motorcycles, trailers, and vehicles over 10,000 pounds.

The Secretary will provide information on injuries and deaths from nontraffic, noncrash events involving motor vehicles, including details on the vehicles and other relevant variables. This information will be made available to the public through the Internet and other means. Additionally, a child safety information program will be implemented within 9 months to address hazards in nontraffic, noncrash incidents. The Secretary will establish a consumer information program to address hazards to children in nontraffic, noncrash incidents, utilizing relevant data to prioritize risks and educate parents on reducing dangers such as back over incidents and hyperthermia in closed vehicles. The Secretary will establish a consumer information program to address hazards to children in nontraffic, noncrash incidents, including back over incidents, hyperthermia in closed vehicles, accidental power window actuation, and other risks deemed necessary. Information related to the program will be made available to the public through various means. If deadlines cannot be met, new deadlines will be established, and the relevant committees will be notified with reasons for the delay.
