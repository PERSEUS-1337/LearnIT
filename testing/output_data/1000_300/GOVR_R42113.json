Federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP, with individual tax revenues also stable at 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. The corporate tax revenue has declined over time, currently accounting for 8.9% of federal tax revenue. In 1952, it generated 32.1% of all federal tax revenue. Individual tax revenue has remained stable at 8.1% of economic output, while payroll tax revenue has increased to 6.0% in 2010. Excise tax revenue has decreased to 0.5% of GDP. Today, individual and payroll taxes generate 41.5% and 40.0% of federal revenue, respectively. The decline in corporate tax revenue is attributed to factors such as a lower average effective corporate tax rate and a reduction in the corporate tax base. This decline may be due to a decrease in corporate tax rates, a decrease in the number of firms operating in the corporate form, or both. The decline in corporate tax revenue is attributed to a lower average effective corporate tax rate and a reduction in the corporate tax base. The effective tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower revenue. This decrease is driven by a reduction in the top statutory rate from around 50% in the 1950s to 35% currently. The average effective tax rate for corporations has fallen due to a reduction in the top statutory rate and the availability of investment tax credits between 1962 and 1986. This has led to a decrease in the effective corporate tax rate below the statutory rate. Since 2004, businesses have been able to claim certain tax benefits to further reduce their effective tax rate. Between 1962 and 1986, changes in tax laws, including investment tax credits and depreciation rules, led to a reduction in the effective corporate tax rate. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reversed some of these changes by aligning tax depreciation with physical depreciation. Bonus depreciation was also temporarily introduced to enhance depreciation deductions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reversed changes in tax laws from 1962 to 1986, aligning tax depreciation with physical depreciation. Bonus depreciation was introduced in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and corporate tax credits have had small effects on effective corporate tax rates. Despite overall decreases, recent spikes in effective tax rates have been observed. The net effect of other factors on effective corporate tax rates has been small compared to accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. Recent spikes in effective tax rates occurred around 2000 and 2007 during recessions when businesses were experiencing losses. Carrying back losses allows firms to reduce taxes paid in previous years, but in severe downturns, two years may not be sufficient for full utilization of losses. This results in higher taxes for struggling corporations. In response to high taxes during recessions, Congress extended the carryback period from two to five years in 2002 and 2008 to help struggling corporations utilize losses. The decline in corporate tax revenue is also attributed to a shrinking nonfinancial corporate tax base due to more income being generated by partnerships and S corporations. The nonfinancial corporate tax base has decreased as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. This shift has led to a smaller corporate tax base, with C corporations generating 44% of business income in 2007 compared to 78% in 1980. The distribution of business income shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations, leading to a smaller corporate tax base. C corporations accounted for 17% of all businesses in 1980 but only 6% in 2007, while S corporations increased in popularity after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Legislation later increased the S corporation shareholder limit, making it a more attractive option. Legislation increased the S corporation shareholder limit from 35 to 100, making it more attractive. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has decreased, affecting the tax base. Profit to asset ratio is a key measure used by economists to assess how well the corporate sector is utilizing its resources. The profit to asset ratio summarizes how well the corporate sector is using its resources to generate profits. Corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966, with economists attributing this decline to various factors. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability since 1966 has been attributed to several factors, including a shift to more volatile industries, younger firms being less profitable, and profit-shifting to lower-tax countries. The analysis highlights profit-shifting by multinational corporations to lower-tax countries, leading to decreased domestic profits. Economists note discrepancies in income reported for tax and financial accounting purposes, with firms incentivized to reduce income for tax purposes. Corporate tax revenues have declined due to lower effective tax rates and changes in tax treatment. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to three primary factors: decreasing average effective corporate tax rate, increasing business activity by pass-through structures, and falling corporate sector profitability. Understanding these reasons is crucial for the ongoing tax reform debate, which focuses on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base. The ongoing tax reform debate aims to reduce statutory rates and broaden the tax base to address the erosion of the corporate tax base. Research suggests that reducing the top corporate rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would involve repealing corporate tax expenditures, changing tax preferences for noncorporate businesses, and implementing other business tax reforms. These reforms could lead to business activity shifting back to the corporate sector and expanding the domestic corporate tax base. Additionally, reforms to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas may reduce profit shifting to low-tax countries, further broadening the tax base. The calculation of average effective tax rates is explained, with data sources and variables provided in Table A-1. The text provides an overview of the mathematics behind calculating average effective tax rates. Table A-1 shows data sources and variables used in the calculation. The equation for the average effective tax corporate tax rate (AECTR) is explained, with government levels and year index identified."
