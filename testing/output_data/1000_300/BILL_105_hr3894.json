    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Air Force Science and Technology Reinvigoration Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Air Force was established with a focus on scientific research and technology development for aeronautical defenses. Scientific investigation is crucial for air, space, and information superiority, requiring a strong research base. The vision of building the Air Force around science, as envisioned by General Henry H. Arnold, remains essential today. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, particularly the aerospace sector, and has made significant contributions to the economy. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE.\" summarizes the Congress's perspective on the science and technology functions of the Department of the Air Force. The Congress emphasizes the importance of allocating funds for emerging technologies within the Air Force, separating management and funding for science and technology from acquisition, investing in new technology areas, and maintaining a base of scientists and engineers for future technological challenges. To maintain a strong base of scientists and engineers for future challenges, the Air Force should increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields, as well as expand the variety of technical master's degrees granted. Additionally, to prevent stagnation, a focused effort should be made to eliminate 5 percent of science and technology programs annually. To prevent stagnation, a concentrated effort should be made to eliminate 5 percent of science and technology programs each year in the Air Force, with funds from discontinued programs used for new ones. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. The text chunk discusses the separation of research and development functions within the Department of the Air Force, including amending sections related to the Secretary of the Air Force and the establishment of an Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology. The text chunk discusses amending sections related to the Secretary of the Air Force and the establishment of an Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology, including changes to subsections and the overall supervision of science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force. Amendments are made to sections related to the Secretary of the Air Force and the establishment of a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology within the Department of the Air Force. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems, address effects on national defense and civilian industries by reducing funding, and recommend appropriate staff levels with specific degrees. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council to study the Air Force's technology base and recommend staff levels with specific degrees. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 120 days."
