    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors to all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming the predominant group in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan language speakers are found in the Sahel grasslands and parts of eastern Africa. The Bantu people became the predominant group in sub-Saharan Africa, while Nilo-Saharan languages are found in the Sahel grasslands and parts of eastern Africa. The origins of iron use in Africa are uncertain, but by 500 BC, the Bantu had mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans were living in farming communities across the continent, growing a variety of crops including maize and peanuts. Some crops were introduced through contacts with the Indian Ocean region and southeast Asia. Many farmers also had cattle, although the tsetse fly limited cattle farming in certain regions. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, exchanging goods with pastoralists. Large towns and cities did not develop due to disease-causing organisms. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent in pre-colonial Africa. In pre-colonial Africa, loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent. Instead, African loyalties were embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships. Powerful individuals or chiefs, known as \"big men,\" exerted influence over wide areas through various means. In pre-colonial Africa, powerful individuals known as \"big men\" consolidated authority through conquest and alliance, leading to the development of African kingdoms like the Kongo kingdom. These kingdoms showcased great artistic achievements, such as naturalistic bronze castings in Benin and stylized Congolese masks. The Atlantic slave trade is believed to have started in 1441. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441 when a man and a woman were captured in Western Sahara and taken to Portugal. Over the next 400 years, between 10-13 million people were taken from Africa, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak of the trade occurred in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the slave trade. The Atlantic slave trade peaked in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the slave trade, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. Despite efforts to halt the trade, slavery continued in the Americas until its abolition in the 1850s and 1860s. U.S. participation in the slave trade was banned in 1807 and strengthened in 1819. The Atlantic slave trade conducted by European traders on the West African coast involved purchasing slaves with goods like guns, alcohol, and cowrie shells. Slavery in Africa was practiced through capturing people in wars or as punishment, with some victims being kidnapped. Historians note that slaves in traditional African societies were often absorbed into families or local armies, with treatment generally less harsh than in the New World plantations. The slave trade in Africa led to turmoil, warfare, and instability in West Africa. The exchange of slaves for guns fueled conflicts, incentivizing warring parties to seek new captives. This warfare, loss of millions of productive individuals, and psychological damage weakened Africa, leaving it ill-prepared for future challenges. The slave trade in Africa led to warfare, loss of millions of people, and psychological damage, weakening the continent. By 1870, European powers were preparing to colonize Africa, despite the presence of strong indigenous political entities like the kingdom of Ashanti and Buganda. By the 1870s, African kingdoms like Ashanti and Buganda had strong central governments, advanced infrastructure, and growing trade. Buganda, for example, was a naval power on Lake Victoria with a powerful king and a strong army. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were also emerging, promoting the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. Islam had been spreading slowly in West Africa through trade contacts and had made larger gains in northeastern Africa through trade and Arab immigration. Africans willingly converted to Islam to associate themselves with the wider Islamic world. In the nineteenth century, holy wars created a vast West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar extended their power on the mainland, while Egypt expanded its control in northeastern Africa. The Boers, practicing a conservative form of Christianity, established a secondary empire in southern Africa. In southern Africa, the Boers, descendants of Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, established a nineteenth-century secondary empire by defeating the Zulu and establishing farms in depopulated grasslands. The European scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities. The Zulu wars were sparked by expansionism as they acquired modern arms and remained a major force in the region under a king ruling through an aristocracy. The European scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities, concluding in 1920 with British forces ending the last resistance in Somalia. By then, all of sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control. Ethiopia resisted Italian colonization, defeating them at Adowa in 1896, but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Italy invaded Ethiopia again in 1935. The European scramble for Africa was facilitated by advances in medicine and military technology, giving them significant advantages over African forces. Many Africans chose not to resist colonial invasion due to Europe's military superiority. In 1896, Ethiopian emperor Menelik II defeated Italian troops at Adowa, but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Italy invaded Ethiopia again in 1935. In 1898, British and Egyptian troops killed 10,800 Sudanese in one day of fighting, with minimal casualties on their side. Many Africans did not resist colonial invasion due to Europe's military advantages. Some African groups, like the Ashanti, Zulu, Boers, Herero, and French West Africans, did launch armed struggles against colonizers. European leaders were initially hesitant to seize African territory, but imperialists and nationalists pushed for expansion. Anti-slavery activists believed direct rule would end slavery in Africa, while missionaries saw benefits for their efforts. Business interests also sought to develop and exploit Africa. The expansion of colonial powers in Africa was driven by popular and political pressure, as well as business interests seeking to exploit the continent's resources. Diamonds were discovered in South Africa in 1871, followed by the finding of gold in Johannesburg in 1885. The profit motive was evident, with King Leopold II of Belgium being particularly influential. Other colonial powers valued Africa's agricultural potential, with Germany aiming to establish a reliable source of raw cotton in Tanganyika. At the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885, King Leopold II of Belgium successfully hid his profit-driven interests behind a facade of humanitarian concerns. With the help of Henry M. Stanley, he built a vast empire in the Congo by funding exploration and persuading local chiefs to sign treaties recognizing his authority. Leopold's International Association of the Congo (IAC) gained sovereignty recognition, supported by Britain and Germany to counter French influence in Africa. The Berlin conference set rules for future colonization in Africa, limiting it to countries with effective control. Britain, France, and Germany emerged as dominant powers, with Portugal also securing territories in Angola and Mozambique. Germany lost its colonies in WWI, establishing Britain as the primary power in Africa. Britain, France, and Germany were dominant powers in Africa, with Britain holding colonies from southern Africa to Egypt, France holding territories in West and Central Africa, and Germany losing its colonies in WWI. The United States did not have colonies in Africa but assisted in settling former slaves in Liberia in 1820. The settlers declared independence in 1847 and used firearms in subsequent decades. The first permanent settlement in Liberia was achieved in 1822 after struggles with disease and local warriors. The settlers declared independence in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples. This expansion has been compared to European colonization and led to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. In 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the Americo-Liberian president, sparking a decade of political violence and a 6-year civil war. The effects of colonialism in Africa are a subject of scholarly debate. The colonial era in Africa led to political violence, human rights violations, and a 6-year civil war in Liberia. Leopold's rule in Congo resulted in forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as policy instruments. The international scandal forced the Belgian government to remove the colony from Leopold's control in 1908. The colonial era in Africa led to political violence, human rights violations, and a 6-year civil war in Liberia. In Congo, Leopold's rule resulted in forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation. The Belgian government removed the colony from Leopold's control in 1908, leading to reforms. Infrastructure like roads and telephone systems were established in British and French-controlled territories. Public health standards improved, elementary education began, and Christian missions promoted education and literacy. Some Africans had opportunities for higher education, travel, and employment, empowering future leaders like Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah. European investment in Africa was limited during the colonial era, with colonial governments expecting African colonies to be self-sufficient in terms of development. The colonial state heavily influenced the economy, regulating crops, prices, and investment. This led to many statist systems persisting after independence, hindering the evolution of market economies in Africa. Leaders like Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and Nnamdi Azikiwe, who studied abroad, later became presidents of their respective countries. Colonial economic policies in Africa heavily influenced the economy, regulating crops, prices, and investment. This dependency on exporting primary products to the developed world in exchange for manufactured goods has contributed to Africa's economic challenges. Colonial governments did not prioritize promoting democracy, viewing the state as a tool for control rather than a platform for democratic development. The colonial state in Africa was authoritarian and not focused on democracy. Political participation was limited until the end of the colonial period when elections began. Colonial regimes worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. The colonial authorities in Africa worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation contributed to problems in independent Africa such as corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism. Colonial practices also shaped present-day ethnic divisions by intensifying language and cultural differences among African peoples. Europeans of the colonial era tended to view the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" which influenced African perspectives as well. The British, in particular, ruled indirectly through \"tribal chiefs\" for administrative convenience. The colonial authorities in Africa worked with local chiefs and tribes, shaping present-day ethnic divisions. Africans advanced their interests through tribal organizations, strengthening tribal loyalties. Ethnic divisions in Africa lead to violent politics, weaken institutions, and undermine economies. Colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, separating linked cultures and trade routes. The colonial partition of Africa imposed artificial boundary divisions, weakening political institutions and economies. Roads and railroads were built to link colonial capitals to their hinterlands, creating transport difficulties between African countries. The imposition of bureaucratic colonial states suppressed indigenous political arrangements, hindering the development of pre-colonial political entities. Historians speculate on the potential development paths that were denied to Africa due to colonial interference. The end of colonialism in Africa was hastened by World War II, weakening Britain and France. The war promoted ideas of democracy and resistance to aggression, resonating with Africa's nationalists. The United Nations Charter affirmed the right of all peoples to choose their form of government. After World War II, African nationalists were inspired by the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter, which promoted self-government and free political institutions in colonial territories. Educated Africans returned home, influenced by European intellectual currents and socialist ideas, organizing opposition to colonial regimes. They drew inspiration from revolutionary movements in Asia and the civil rights struggle in America, particularly from W.E.B. DuBois. By the late 1940s, African nationalists, inspired by W.E.B. DuBois and influenced by revolutionary movements in Asia and the civil rights struggle in America, were organizing opposition to colonial regimes. British policymakers foresaw African independence in the distant future, while France pursued a policy of assimilation for its colonies. Nationalist sentiments were growing across Africa by the early 1950s. In the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments were rising in Africa, leading to anti-colonial protests and independence movements. Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Guinea shocked France by choosing independence over close association in 1958. In 1960, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence. Guinea's choice for independence in 1958 surprised France, leading to the emergence of 14 independent countries in French-held Africa. Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule. Rhodesia declared independence from Britain in 1965, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. Guerrilla wars in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s resulted in independence in 1975. Namibia gained independence in 1990 after a U.N.-supervised election. In 1975, after the ousting of Portuguese military dictator Antonio Salazar in a 1974 coup in Lisbon, armed struggle also took place in Namibia. South Africa had taken Namibia from Germany in 1914, but independence did not come until 1990, following a U.N.-supervised election. In South Africa, whites of English and Afrikaner descent had enjoyed self-government since 1910. The National Party came to power in 1948 and imposed apartheid. Protests against apartheid mounted in the late 1960s, leading to an increasingly violent resistance campaign met by harsh government repression in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s, South Africa faced international isolation due to apartheid. Secret discussions with the ANC led to Nelson Mandela's release in 1990 and constitutional negotiations in 1993. Universal-suffrage elections were held in April 1994. In the 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with the departure of colonial governments and the rise of a new African elite. GNP per capita was increasing, and development projects were expected to boost growth. The Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote African solidarity. In the 1960s, African countries saw growth potential with the establishment of the Organization of African Unity in 1963. However, challenges arose with civil wars, secession attempts, and political instability in various nations. In the 1960s, African countries faced political instability and civil wars, leading to economic decline in the following decades. Authoritarian regimes and violent governments, like Idi Amin's in Uganda, fueled conflicts in countries such as Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Chad, Angola, and Mozambique. The region's per capita economic growth plummeted, with annual rates dropping to negative figures in the 1980s. In the post-independence era, African countries faced political instability, civil wars, and economic decline. The impact of colonialism, ethnic divisions, authoritarian rule, and bureaucratic interference were key factors contributing to the challenges of independence. Limited indigenous elites and the late establishment of colleges and universities further complicated the situation. In the post-independence era, African countries faced political instability, civil wars, and economic decline. Limited indigenous elites dealt with challenges of independence. The Cold War fueled conflicts in Africa with arms from the Soviet Union and economic assistance from the United States to authoritarian regimes. During the Cold War, African countries received weapons from the Soviet Union and economic aid from the United States. This led to the strengthening of anti-democratic governments with inefficient economic policies and corruption. France also played a role in Africa to maintain its great power status by cultivating relationships with its former colonies' elites. France maintained a \"special relationship\" with its former African colonies, viewing them as its \"exclusive hunting ground.\" This included close ties with francophone regimes in Zaire and Rwanda, providing military and economic assistance. Critics argued that this perpetuated corrupt and authoritarian regimes, while defenders claimed France was contributing positively. French troops were stationed at African bases, and French businesses gained privileged access to trade and investment opportunities. Critics argued that French policy supported corrupt and authoritarian regimes, while defenders claimed it contributed to stability and development. France began reducing its military and financial commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party won legislative elections in May 1997. Scholars in the late 1980s and early 1990s focused on African state and society characteristics to explain the continent's difficulties, leading to discouraging conclusions about weak states' ability to promote change and development. Some scholars concluded that African states were too weak to promote societal change and economic development due to corruption, personal ambitions of leaders, ethnic favoritism, and \"pathological patrimonialism.\" There was academic discussion of the \"failed state\" in Africa, with economic difficulties and overall GDP growth of 2.0% per year from 1990 to 1998, lower than the population growth rate of 2.6%. In the early 1990s, Africa faced famine, conflict, and economic difficulties, with GDP growth at 2.0% per year, lower than the population growth rate. However, positive developments such as the end of the Cold War and changes in South Africa gave hope for a better future. Many anticipated that a stable South Africa would drive economic growth in the sub-Saharan region. Several African countries were already implementing free market economic reforms. By the mid-1990s, despite slow growth in Africa, some countries were experiencing GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates, with annual increases of 5% or more. Political reforms were underway in authoritarian states due to demands for democratization, leading to national political conferences and the representation of various interests in civil society. Multiple political parties were allowed in countries that had been one-party states for years. In the mid-1990s, political reforms in Africa led to national conferences representing diverse interests in civil society. Multiple political parties emerged in countries that were previously one-party states, with elections appearing free and fair. Analysts initially reacted favorably to these developments, but some authoritarian leaders later manipulated the electoral process, causing disappointment in the democratization progress. Observers note that the hopes of the early 1990s for African democratization have faded due to authoritarian leaders manipulating the electoral process. Countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon are seen as \"pseudo-democracies\" that liberalize politically under pressure but repress opposition to hold onto power. Richard Joseph described the situation in 1998 as resulting in \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but stifling opposition behind a mask of legitimacy. Recent events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire further highlight these challenges. In Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, recent events have been discouraging for advocates of democratization. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup in 1999 and exclusion of a qualified candidate from elections led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, political violence marred the 2000 elections, with opposition members killed. Critics also accused the government of using violent tactics to take over white-owned farms. In Zimbabwe, the opposition made gains in the June 2000 parliamentary elections, but political violence marred the campaign period, leading to the death of several opposition members. The government's tactics to take over farms owned by whites raised concerns about the rule of law. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic is worsening, with about 25.3 million people infected with HIV in the region, accounting for over 70% of the global total. Uganda and Senegal have been successful in slowing the spread of the disease through effective prevention campaigns. The AIDS epidemic in Africa has been devastating, with high infection rates and mortality. Uganda and Senegal have had success in prevention campaigns, but overall, the infection rate in Africa is much higher than the global average. Armed conflicts in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo have further hindered development and created refugee crises. The Rwanda genocide of 1994 and subsequent conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have hindered development and created refugee crises in Africa. Several countries have troops in Congo, leading to fears of wider war. Economic performance in Africa has been disappointing, with GDP growth lagging behind population growth, leaving the region economically stagnant. The economic performance in Africa has been disappointing, with GDP growth lagging behind population growth, leading to the region being economically stagnant. Academic authors describe the region as \"marginalized\" in the global economy, with Afro-pessimists predicting dim political and economic prospects for the continent in the coming years. A study by the U.S. National Intelligence Council in 2000 concluded that poor governance, demographics, and disease will contribute to Africa's increasing international marginalization by 2015. Poor governance, demographics, and disease will lead to Africa's increasing international marginalization in 2015. Most African states will miss out on global economic growth, with only a few countries doing better. Sub-Saharan Africa's problems will worsen, leading to ethnic tensions and conflicts. Afro-pessimism is criticized for stereotyping Africa and focusing on violent events. Afro-pessimism is criticized for stereotyping Africa and focusing on violent events, but experts argue for a new reality in Africa with governments becoming more accountable, economic empowerment, and progress in addressing problems. The International Monetary Fund acknowledges economic stagnation but sees potential for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa supports this positive outlook. The brieftook an upbeat approach, highlighting economic policy reforms leading to an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa. President Thabo Mbeki and U.S. Ambassador James Joseph endorsed the African Renaissance concept, emphasizing democratic transitions in South Africa and Nigeria. The optimistic view highlights successful democratic transitions in South Africa and Nigeria, with widespread gains in democratization through electoral processes in Africa. The wave of elections in recent years has set precedents for further democratization, despite economic disappointments in some countries. The optimistic view in Africa highlights successful democratic transitions in countries like South Africa and Nigeria, setting precedents for further democratization. Despite economic disappointments, several African countries have shown promising GDP growth rates, with the potential for improved governance and support from the international community to enhance opportunities and quality of life. Debt relief and natural resources also play important roles in poverty reduction efforts. The Clinton Administration's Afro-optimist policy towards Africa emphasized the continent's potential for growth and development, despite acknowledging ongoing economic challenges and conflicts. President Clinton's visit to Africa in 1998 highlighted the concept of an \"African Renaissance\" and emphasized the importance of democracy, peace, and prosperity for the region's future. President Clinton visited Africa in 2000, praising Nigeria for its democratic progress, cooperation in combating crime, and leadership in peacekeeping. He also emphasized the need to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. President Clinton praised Nigeria for its democratic progress, cooperation in combating crime, and leadership in peacekeeping during his 2000 visit to Africa. He also highlighted the importance of addressing the African HIV/AIDS epidemic and emphasized Africa's potential as a U.S. trading partner, particularly in oil imports. The Clinton Administration supported the African Growth and Opportunity Act as a trade and investment initiative for the region. The Clinton Administration endorsed the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, aiming to enhance Africa's access to the Internet and reduce food insecurity in eastern Africa. They also launched the LIFE Initiative to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and worldwide. The Clinton Administration launched the LIFE Initiative in July 1999 to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and worldwide, involving various U.S. agencies. Administration policy faced challenges, including the incident in Somalia in October 1993. In response to the Somalia incident in 1993, the US and UN hesitated to send peacekeepers during the Rwanda genocide in 1994. President Clinton admitted to not acting quickly enough. The Administration then focused on strengthening Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through initiatives like ACRI and training Nigerian battalions for peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. US officials also played mediator roles in African conflicts, including facilitating a peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Administration launched a \"train and equip\" program to help Nigerian battalions prepare for peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. US officials mediated in African conflicts, including the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Trade results during the Clinton years were mixed, with slower growth in imports and exports to Africa compared to overall US trade. During the Clinton years, trade between the US and Africa saw slower growth compared to overall US trade. Most trade was with a few countries, particularly oil producers and South Africa. Petroleum accounted for over half of imports. US investment in sub-Saharan Africa, focused on the petroleum sector, was about 1.2% of total US foreign direct investment. Despite this, US firms made significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell's share in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Officials highlighted major U.S. investments in Africa, including Southwestern Bell's share in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa gained importance in U.S. foreign policy in 1958 with the creation of a Bureau of African Affairs. Controversies have arisen over Africa policy, with debates on whether administrations are doing enough on issues like apartheid, African development, and Soviet/Cuban involvement. The Eisenhower Administration faced its first African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion. The Eisenhower Administration faced its first African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion, fearing Soviet exploitation. The Kennedy Administration was more supportive of African nationalists but faced limitations due to Cold War pressures. Kennedy approved funding for a controversial dam in Ghana and pressed for reforms in southern Africa. The United States backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa in 1963. During the Johnson Administration, the focus shifted to Congo (Zaire), where the U.S. provided covert aid to suppress communist-inspired rebellions. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with U.S. backing. Limited military assistance was given, but concerns over another Vietnam prevented deeper involvement. In the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the focus shifted to southern Africa. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the focus shifted to southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Political controversy arose over policymakers' perceived sympathy towards white minority regimes. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing aggressive policies in Africa. Congress banned further involvement in Angola in 1975, with Kissinger accusing them of avoiding confrontation with Soviet expansionism. During President Jimmy Carter's Administration (1977-1981), U.S. foreign policy in Africa shifted towards emphasizing human rights, advocating for majority rule in Zimbabwe, independence for Namibia, and criticizing apartheid in South Africa. Despite pressure for reforms in Zaire, Cold War considerations continued to constrain Africa policy. The Administration did not intervene in the Liberia coup in 1980, possibly due to human rights violations discrediting the regime. The Carter Administration faced challenges from perceived Soviet and Cuban gains in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to domestic political pressure for a response. The Carter Administration responded to Soviet and Cuban influence in sub-Saharan Africa by forging ties with Somalia, which led to the Ogaden War in 1977-1978. Cuba and Ethiopia launched a successful counteroffensive against Somalia, averting a crisis. The Administration also opposed mandatory sanctions against South Africa due to Cold War concerns. Troops crossed into Somalia, Cuba and Ethiopia launched a successful counteroffensive against the Somalis but their advance halted at the border, averting a crisis. Cuban troops were also in Angola assisting the Marxist regime against UNITA. The Reagan Administration had concerns about the Cuban deployment in Angola and supported covert aid to UNITA. Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. In 1985, legislation prohibiting was repealed. Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, favored a \"linkage\" policy to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. Despite political opposition, a regional peace agreement in 1988 achieved these goals. In 1986, Congress enacted sanctions legislation over President Reagan's veto. The George H.W. Bush Administration focused on the Horn of Africa, helping to arrange the overthrow of the Ethiopian regime in 1991. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, policymakers focused on the Horn of Africa. They successfully arranged a peaceful transition in Ethiopia in 1991, avoiding upheaval like in Liberia. Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, leading to a humanitarian disaster by 1992. Bush sent U.S. troops for a massive humanitarian intervention, saving thousands despite American casualties in 1993. The administration also pushed for reforms in Mobutu's regime as part of promoting democracy and economic liberalization in Africa. The Bush Administration's intervention in Somalia in 1993 saved thousands from starvation despite American casualties. Congress passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000 to boost U.S. trade with Africa. Additionally, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act authorized $300 million for HIV/AIDS efforts worldwide. In FY2001 and FY2002, Congress authorized $300 million for a global HIV/AIDS effort. The Africa: Seeds of Hope Act in 1998 aimed to promote African food security. The African Conflict Resolution Act in 1994 supported peaceful resolution of African conflicts. The South African Democratic Transition Support Act in 1993 backed democracy in South Africa. The Development Fund for Africa was created by Congress in 1990. In 1993, the United States committed to supporting democracy in South Africa. In 1990, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) to protect Africa aid levels post-Cold War. In 1992, the Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act was passed to promote democracy. In 1986, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act set policy objectives for the US in South Africa. In 1985, Congress passed an emergency appropriation for African famine relief. In 1985, Congress passed an emergency appropriation for African famine relief and repealed the Clark Amendment. In 1971, the \"Byrd Amendment\" exempted the US from UN sanctions on Rhodesia. In 1976, the \"Clark Amendment\" prohibited aid to groups in Angola for military operations, sponsored by Senator Dick Clark. The Appropriation (P.L. 92-156) exempted the US from UN sanctions on white-ruled Rhodesia by prohibiting the President from enforcing the trade embargo on critical materials like chromium and nickel. The curr_chunk provides a list of books and resources related to Africa, including works on authority, democracy, foreign policy, and specific countries like Congo and Nigeria. The curr_chunk lists updated CRS Issue Briefs on various topics related to Africa, including AIDS, Congo, Nigeria, and Sudan."
