    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising health insurance enrollment and an aging population. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care provision are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax treatment on certain forms of income, resulting in foregone revenue. Congressional focus on health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, and impact since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Health-related tax expenditures are analyzed in this report to determine their value, changes over time, and impact since the Affordable Care Act. The report focuses on historical data from the Joint Committee on Taxation to compare these tax expenditures with total revenue collected and federal support for health programs. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) at the budget function level. For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and for broader analysis, see CRS Report R44012. The report relies on JCT's definition and estimation methodology for tax expenditures. The report analyzes tax expenditures by budget function using the Joint Committee on Taxation's methodology, based on the definition from the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. JCT uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income to identify provisions causing revenue losses. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) analyzes tax expenditures by budget function, categorizing provisions that cause revenue losses. These provisions are considered \"tax expenditures\" and result in revenue forgone from the income tax system. JCT categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, and housing, to identify provisions with similar policy purposes. The Department of the Treasury also maintains its own list of tax expenditures by budget function. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, like health, commerce, and housing, to identify provisions with similar policy purposes. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures by budget function. JCT's health budget function for tax expenditures is broader than OMB's health budget functions for outlays, due to historical practices and the complexity of containing cross-cutting health provisions within narrow categories. Health tax expenditures are categorized by budget area, with different criteria used by various organizations. Economists evaluate these expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity to aid Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures are evaluated by economists based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity to assist Congressional decision-making. For example, tax expenditures in health insurance can correct market inefficiencies but may also undermine tax progressivity. The tax code's advantage in administering social policy for lower-income households is due to direct reporting of income and family size on tax forms. The tax code's advantage in administering social policy for lower-income households is due to direct reporting of income and family size on tax forms. Administering social programs through the tax code could increase tax filing complexity and administration costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures, excluding Medicare-related provisions. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion, with the largest tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) being the largest in the federal tax code. The ESI tax exclusion is projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges. From FY2015 to FY2019, JCT estimates that the annual tax expenditure amount for the ESI tax exclusion will increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion. The second largest health tax expenditure value is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with APTCs increasing from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion during the same period. These tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs and activities with positive societal benefits. Some government health programs aim to reduce costs of private activities with societal benefits, such as tax deductions for charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations. Older health tax provisions in the code may have origins in legal doctrine or income definitions at adoption, indirectly affected by other policies. These provisions are subcomponents of larger activity categories, reflecting historical exemptions in the income tax system. The tax treatment of charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations is a subcomponent of larger activity categories in the income tax system. The origins of the ESI tax exclusion can be traced back to 1918, with its role significantly expanded during and after World War II. Regulatory rulings and revisions of the Internal Revenue Code have influenced the tax treatment of employer health contributions. The ESI exclusion was expanded during and after World War II, with contributions explicitly excluded from income in the Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 show changes in provisions over time. Medicare-related tax provisions were analyzed separately through FY2014. The JCT analyzed three Medicare-related tax provisions separately through FY2014. Multiple tax expenditure provisions were combined to show changes over time in tax expenditures. Health-related tax expenditures have increased in value over time after adjusting for inflation. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars and 7.5% in real dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. Post-ACA enactment in 2010, annual growth rates in health-related tax expenditures fluctuate around historical averages. The estimated annual value of health tax expenditures is projected to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. The growth rates of health-related tax expenditures are positive, fluctuating above and below historical averages. In nominal dollars, the annual value is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. Factors contributing to this growth include changes in demographics, health care costs exceeding inflation, and policy changes affecting costs. JCT previously identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as benefits exceeding insurance payments before FY2015. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as benefits exceeding insurance payments. Medicare benefits are excluded from income tax, but a positive tax expenditure was measured if insurance benefits exceeded what enrollees paid. For example, a positive tax expenditure for Medicare Part D indicated that insurance value exceeded premiums paid. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with estimates showing minimal values before FY1987. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with estimates showing minimal values before FY1987. From FY1987 to FY2014, the annual tax expenditure value for Medicare-related provisions increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) on average. JCT estimated that these provisions were 26.8% relative to the total value of health tax expenditures over five years. Health-related tax expenditures have also increased from 1.9% of total revenue collected in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. In FY2014, Medicare provisions accounted for 26.8% of health tax expenditures over five years, increasing from 1.9% in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. Health tax expenditures are projected to rise from 6.4% in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019, with values not fully reflecting tax policies in the health sector. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue in the health sector, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. Additionally, a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was imposed on higher-income taxpayers. Despite these taxes, the revenue generated is small compared to total health tax expenditures. Figure 3 shows health-related tax expenditures as a share of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The comparison between federal health outlays and tax expenditures can track support to the health sector or household health expenses over time. Medicare and Medicaid are the largest federal health programs. The comparison between federal health outlays and tax expenditures can track support to the health sector or household health expenses over time. Medicare and Medicaid are the largest federal health programs, with mandatory outlays primarily funding them. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were still less than health mandatory outlays. Health-related tax expenditures have grown over time, reaching 1.5% of GDP in FY2014. Health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014.
