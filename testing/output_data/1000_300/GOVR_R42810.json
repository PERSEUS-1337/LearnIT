    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the nation's largest integrated health care system, providing medical care to veterans based on various eligibility factors. Special treatment authority has been granted by Congress for certain groups of veterans, such as those exposed to Agent Orange under the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72). In 1981, Congress granted special authority to the VA to treat veterans exposed to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation, despite lack of definitive scientific evidence. In 1993, additional authority was provided for health care for Persian Gulf War veterans. Camp Lejeune, North Carolina had contaminated water-supply systems in the early 1980s. P.L. 112-154 addressed the chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina by providing VA health care services eligibility for certain veterans stationed there from 1957 to 1987. These veterans can receive medical care for specific illnesses like esophageal cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. The VA provides medical care for veterans stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987, due to contaminated well water. Eligible veterans can receive care for specific illnesses such as esophageal cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members' health insurance. The State Veterans' Home program helps build nursing home facilities. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership to build nursing home facilities. The VA provides grants and per diem for veterans receiving care in these homes. State laws govern admission criteria, and the VA pays full care costs for certain eligible veterans. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability regardless of the care setting. It also allowed for higher per diem rates for State Veterans Homes caring for these veterans. The VA was authorized to use higher per diem rates for State Veterans Homes caring for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability by P.L. 109-461. However, some homes reported receiving inadequate reimbursements. P.L. 112-154 now requires the VA to contract with SVHs for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating, with reimbursement methodology developed in consultation with SVHs. The VA is required to contract with State Veterans Homes for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating. The Government Accountability Office found about 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from 2007 to 2010, including rape and other forms of assault. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the Inspector General due to a lack of reporting. The Government Accountability Office found about 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from 2007 to 2010, including rape and other forms of assault. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the Inspector General due to a lack of reporting. Section 106 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to establish a comprehensive policy on the reporting and tracking of sexual assault and other safety incidents at VA medical facilities. This provision also requires the VA to consider the effects on veterans' use of mental health and substance abuse treatments in developing the policy. The VA is required to develop a comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant issue for veterans, especially from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF), due to blast injuries. The increase in blast injuries from explosive devices in OIF has led to a rise in TBI cases among veterans. Advances in protective gear and medical care have reduced fatalities. However, accurate diagnosis of TBI remains a challenge, with concerns raised about the limited interpretation of rehabilitative care by the VA. The VA is required to provide comprehensive rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize independence and improve mental health. Telemedicine is used for medical communication and information technologies. Telemedicine and telehealth are used in the VA's long-term care programs for veterans with TBI, providing electronic communication for medical purposes and supporting long-distance clinical care and health education. The term telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided using communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and psychiatry. It involves clinicians using technology to deliver mental health care to patients remotely. The VA has been a national leader in telehealth activities since 1977. The VA has been a national leader in telehealth activities since 1977, providing mental health care to patients remotely, especially in rural areas. Telehealth offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective within the VA health care system. VA is required to carry out a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities unable to provide such assessments. The VA is mandated to provide teleconsultation programs for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking the capability without using contract or fee-basis care. Additionally, the VA must offer telemedicine training to medical residents in facilities utilizing telemedicine. Veterans in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for service-connected conditions, and those rated at 50% or more disabled are exempt from copayments for any condition. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for any condition, including nonservice-connected ones. Outpatient services like health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care are also copayment-free. Veterans without service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions typically pay $15 for primary care and $50 for specialty care visits, with a limit of one copayment per day. Section 103 of P.L. 112-154 allows VA to waive copayments for telehealth consultations. P.L. 107-135 authorizes VA to provide service dogs for hearing or mobility impaired veterans. P.L. 111-117 permits VA to offer service dogs for mental illnesses like PTSD. P.L. 111-84 also addresses veterans' healthcare programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 and National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 authorized the VA to provide service dogs for veterans with mental and physical injuries, including PTSD. Section 109 of P.L. 112-154 allows accredited service dogs access to VA facilities. Congress mandated the establishment of an Office of Rural Health in 2006 to assist with data collection on rural veterans. The Office of Rural Health (ORH) was established by Congress in 2006 to assist the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in collecting data on rural veterans and developing strategies to reduce disparities in service. The VHA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) in 2009 to create special practices for facilities nationwide. These Centers, located in Maine, Vermont, Florida, Iowa, and Utah, serve as clinical laboratories for new outreach and care models. The Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) were established by Congress in 2006 to assist the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in collecting data on rural veterans and developing strategies to reduce disparities in service. The VRHRCs, located in Maine, Vermont, Florida, Iowa, and Utah, serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 outlines the functions of VRHRCs, including improving understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identifying disparities in healthcare availability, formulating practices to enhance healthcare delivery, and developing special practices and products for rural veterans. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover medical service costs. However, it did not allow the VA to keep these payments, requiring them to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) granted the VHA the ability to retain these funds in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. The VA could increase collections by changing billing from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" for higher payments. In FY2004, the Administration consolidated medical collections accounts into the MCCF as recommended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. The Administration consolidated various medical collections accounts into the MCCF in FY2004, as recommended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. The VA was granted permanent authority to deposit funds from specific accounts into the MCCF by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. Funds in the MCCF are available for veterans' medical services and can be spent in any fiscal year. The VA has permanent authority to deposit funds from specific accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. Section 111 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for the MCCF, including effective billing and collection policies, employee training, revenue goals, and monitoring systems. The VA is required to develop a plan for billing and collection of funds to meet fee revenue goals. A three-year initiative is in place to assess treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. The VA Secretary must report to Congress on the initiative within 180 days of enactment. The VA Secretary is required to issue a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the beneficiaries of the initiative and an analysis of the initiative. VA provides eligible veterans and beneficiaries with mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in cases of medical emergency. VA reimbursement for ambulance services is based on a contracted rate or providers' billed charges. The VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to save costs. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services. However, this change only applied when VA had not entered into a contract with the provider. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. This change aimed to save costs but had limited impact as VA typically determines eligibility before payment for ambulance services. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. The new reimbursement methodology will apply to all ambulance transportation situations except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care of nonservice-connected conditions approved for payment. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for health care and copayments. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for health care and copayments, including means testing for nonservice-connected conditions. P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to use the veteran's household income for the most recent year to determine eligibility for VA health care. Changes were made to the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program to assist veterans and servicemembers with certain service-connected disabilities in purchasing or remodeling homes. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers two grant programs for veterans and active duty servicemembers with mobility impairments or blindness. The grants, known as \u00a72101(a) and \u00a72101(b) grants, provide funding for home adaptations. The dollar limit for the \u00a72101(a) grant is higher, and both grants are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expanded eligibility for the \u00a72101(a) grant to cover veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for housing grants to veterans or servicemembers who have lost the use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion. Section 203 changes the measure of blindness for grants from 5/200 visual acuity to 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lenses. Section 204 increases the maximum grant amount. The VA visual impairment standard for disability compensation has been changed to 20/200 as part of the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. The maximum amount of assistance for housing grants has been increased under P.L. 112-154, with the new law requiring annual adjustments based on a cost-of-construction index. Veterans can now use grants to modify the homes of family members they live with. The statutory grant limits were increased under P.L. 112-154, with the maximum TRA grants raised to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b). The TRA grants now undergo annual adjustments based on a cost-of-construction index, and the authority for TRA grants has been extended beyond December 31, 2012. The authority for TRA grants was extended to December 31, 2022, with increased maximum grants based on a cost-of-construction index. An exception allows for additional funding in cases where a previously-adapted home is substantially damaged in a disaster. The VA Loan Guaranty Program under P.L. 112-154 provides assistance for disabled veterans or servicemembers to acquire another suitable home, with a maximum benefit based on repair costs or statutory grant maximums. The program guarantees a portion of mortgages with private lenders to mitigate losses from borrower default. Unlike the FHA program, the VA only guarantees a portion of the loan. The VA Loan Guaranty Program guarantees a portion of mortgages with private lenders to mitigate losses from borrower default. Veterans pay a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service. Surviving spouses of veterans are now eligible for loan guaranty benefits. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Spouses must meet specific duration requirements for eligibility. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Spouses must meet specific duration requirements for eligibility, such as being continuously rated totally disabling for a certain period before death. Additionally, changes in the law allow for exceptions to the housing occupancy requirement, including for veterans called away for active duty and their dependents. P.L. 112-154 expands VA loan programs to include dependent children of veterans called for active duty. It also makes adjustable rate mortgage programs permanent and modifies fee waiver eligibility for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The new law allows disability compensation eligibility based on pre-discharge examination or review of existing medical evidence. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 addresses loan fees, guaranty amounts, and loan sales securities for veterans. It extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas. The new law extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas, increasing the maximum guaranty amount to 25% of the loan. The maximum guaranty amount for VA loans may reach up to 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas. The increased limit is in effect until December 31, 2014, and the VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. Prior to this extension, the VA used the Enhanced Use Lease process to lease unused property for VA-related purposes. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease program allows properties to be leased for \"supportive housing\" purposes only, defined as housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. This change was implemented by Section 211 of P.L. 112-154. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease program allows properties to be leased for \"supportive housing\" purposes, defined as housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Transitional, permanent, and single room occupancy housing, congregate living, independent living, or assisted living all qualify. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws. The VA may receive \"cash at fair value\" for consideration, and must release an annual report on consideration received for EULs. The first report should address recommendations from a VA Inspector General's report. Also known as the Comprehensive Service Programs, the Grant and Per Diem program. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes the VA to provide grants for transitional housing and services to homeless veterans. Grantees receive capital grants for facility purchase or rehabilitation and per diem reimbursements for housing and services. The per diem rate is currently $38.90 per day. The Grant and Per Diem program reimburses grant recipients for providing housing and supportive services to homeless veterans, with a per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Grants can be used for construction of service centers and transitional housing, and grantees can also utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits in conjunction with VA funding. Private nonprofit organizations, including for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with specific criteria, are eligible to receive funds from other sources for project operation. The VA Grant and Per Diem program authorizes funding for homeless veterans with special needs, expanding eligibility to include male veterans. Funding amounts are set at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, with grants used for housing and supportive services. The Grant and Per Diem program targets homeless veterans with special needs, including women, women with children, the frail elderly, veterans with terminal illnesses, and those with chronic mental illnesses. Section 303 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility to include male veterans with dependent children, eliminates the requirement for grantees to already be providers, allows funds to be used for services to dependents, and extends authorization levels. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program provides outreach, care for medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders, and referrals to supportive services. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program provides outreach, medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorder treatment for homeless veterans. P.L. 112-154 expanded eligibility to include all homeless veterans, not just those with serious mental illnesses. The HUD-VASH program combines VA and HUD resources to provide housing vouchers and support services to homeless veterans. Section 304 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to contract with other entities for services. Section 304 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to contract with other entities, such as state or local government agencies or nonprofit organizations, to help homeless veterans find suitable housing and connect them with services. This can occur in situations where there is a shortage of affordable housing, a veteran needs more assistance than the VA can provide, or the veteran does not live near a VA facility. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends the authorization for programs serving homeless veterans, including the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). HVRP helps homeless veterans find employment, while SSVF assists low-income veterans and their families in transitioning from homelessness to housing. The authorization for HVRP is extended through FY2013 at $50 million per year, and the SSVF program is authorized for FY2013 at $300 million, up from $100 million in FY2012. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational assistance to dependents of servicemembers disabled, delayed, or deceased due to military service. DEA participants are entitled to 45 months of benefits, with an option to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement. The amendment takes effect on October 1, 2013, and applies to entitlement not exhausted before that date. The amendment allows for combining benefit programs to receive up to 81 months of entitlement, starting October 1, 2013. It applies to the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program. The Secretary of Defense and VA Secretary are required to report annually to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA. The reports must include information on benefit levels, recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces, program expenditures, and student outcome measures. The VA report must inform Armed Forces members of active duty eligibility requirements, Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA benefit usage, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Section 402 repeals biennial reporting requirements for the Secretary of Defense and VA Secretary on the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing benefit decisions can submit additional evidence, which may cause delays in the Board of Veterans' Appeals reaching a decision. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) must send newly submitted evidence to the local VA office for initial review, unless the claimant waives this right. If no request is made, the BVA will review the evidence. This provision will be effective 180 days after the law's enactment. Prior to this law, the VA lacked authority to allow court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives, caregivers, or attorneys to sign claim applications on behalf of claimants. Section 505 of the same law permits the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement in certain cases. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement when sufficient evidence is already available for maximum benefit award. It also encourages claimants to submit relevant private medical records to prevent unnecessary resource expenditure. Section 507 clarifies that if a veteran receiving VA benefits passes away, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims. If a veteran receiving VA benefits dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits for that month. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to provide notification of evidence needed for claims more efficiently, including printing the notice on claims forms and removing the requirement to send the notice on subsequent claims if the issue was covered in a previous claim within the past year. The VA can now print notices on claims forms, send notifications electronically, and waive notification requirements for claims where the highest evaluation is already determined. The Fully Developed Claim process expedites disability claims, with the effective date being the claim application date and claims generally expiring after one year. The VA has implemented a pilot program to expedite disability claims processing. The effective date of a claim is usually when the VA receives the application, and claims typically expire after one year. However, for original FDC disability claims, the effective date can be up to one year before the application is received. This change is only available for three years for claims received before August 7, 2015. The VA Secretary and Social Security Commissioner must use joint application forms for survivor benefits. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 allows for a joint form to apply for benefits with both agencies. Any document indicating intent to apply for benefits is considered an application with both VA and SSA. The Improved Disability Pension program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans with active military service during a war period. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for married veteran couples requiring aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is raised to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the cash benefit amount for both the Improved Disability Pension and Improved Death Pension programs. The maximum annual benefit for married veteran couples requiring aid and attendance is increased to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the cash benefit amount for the Improved Disability Pension and Improved Death Pension programs. Section 509 of P.L. 112-154 expands the exclusion for calculating income to include reimbursements for expenses for replacement or repair of equipment, vehicles, items, money, or property. Disabled veterans and servicemembers may be eligible for financial assistance from the VA to purchase an automobile or adaptive equipment. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA Secretary to provide assistance to a veteran. The VA provides financial assistance to disabled veterans and servicemembers for purchasing automobiles or adaptive equipment. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows for assistance in purchasing a second automobile if the first one was destroyed due to a disaster. The VA's VR&E Program offers employment-related services and independent living services for veterans with disabilities. The VR&E program offers services for veterans with disabilities, including employment assistance and independent living support. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands provisions for veterans affected by disasters, extending subsistence allowances and waiving limits on IL services for displaced veterans. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands provisions for veterans affected by disasters, extending subsistence allowances and waiving limits on IL services for displaced veterans. It also increases restrictions on public demonstrations at veterans' funerals. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations during funerals of servicemembers and veterans. Demonstrations are now restricted 120 minutes before and after a funeral, with increased minimum distance requirements. Violations can result in statutory damages ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 of P.L. 112-154 prohibits the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition. The Secretary of the Army can designate areas in the cemetery to honor missing veterans and servicemembers. Section 604 of P.L. 112-154 outlines additional requirements. The Secretary of the Army can establish monuments in Arlington National Cemetery to honor missing veterans and servicemembers, with a 25-year waiting period after their last day of service. The 25-year requirement can be waived after public and congressional notification. Monuments sponsored by nongovernmental entities can be built after providing an independent study of other locations and consulting with the Secretary of the Army. Section 604 allows for the establishment of a monument in Arlington National Cemetery by a nongovernmental entity, funded by public sources, after meeting certain requirements including consultation with relevant committees and providing notice to Congress. Additionally, the VA can provide a certificate with the President's signature to eligible survivors of deceased veterans upon request. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the Presidential Memorial Certificate to include persons who die in active military, naval, or air service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers facing financial obligations due to their military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) offers protections for servicemembers facing financial obligations due to their military service, including suspending civil claims, protecting against eviction, capping interest rates, and safeguarding insurance policies. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers, including suspending civil claims, protecting against eviction, capping interest rates, safeguarding insurance policies, and extending mortgage and foreclosure protections until December 31, 2014. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers in property transactions subject to a mortgage or security loan during military service. It prevents vendors from taking action to rescind or terminate contracts, foreclose, or seize property until one year after active duty ends. Additionally, the act requires a report to Congress on these protections. Section 701 of the SCRA requires a report to Congress on protections within 540 days of enactment. Section 703 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA Secretary to report on evaluating and training VBA employees processing benefit claims within 180 days. The VA has special authority to conduct competitions for small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. Firms misrepresenting their status for contracting preferences are subject to debarment. Firms or owners misrepresenting their status for contracting preferences under the 2006 act are subject to debarment, which is a punishment imposed for a specified period of time. Debarment is only imposed in cases where status has been \"willfully and intentionally\" misrepresented. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 clarifies that debarment is imposed for willful and intentional misrepresentation of status, with a minimum period of five years. It also sets time frames for debarment actions and outlines treatment of principals of debarred firms. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 prescribes time frames for debarment actions and treatment of principals of debarred firms. It requires the VA to start a debarment action within 30 days of determining willful misrepresentation and complete it within 90 days. Debarment includes all principals for at least five years. The VA must report on conferences costing $20,000 or more with 50+ attendees every fiscal quarter. Federal contractors with contracts over $100,000 must report employment data to the DOL annually. P.L. 112-154 mandates a VetStar program for VA awards and a DOL website for contractor employment disclosures.
