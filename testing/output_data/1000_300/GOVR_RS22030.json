    "content": "The EU's response to the 9/11 attacks and the presence of Al Qaeda cells in Europe led to increased efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence matters. The EU, a partnership of 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Harmonizing policies in \"justice and home affairs\" is a key focus, including measures to enhance internal security, protect citizens' rights, and facilitate free movement within the EU. Efforts in the JHA field aim to foster common internal security measures, protect EU citizens' rights, and promote free movement within the EU. This includes countering terrorism, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, and border control policies. EU attempts to establish common JHA policies were initially hindered by member state concerns about national sovereignty and legal systems. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted a shift in mindset among EU leaders and member states towards enhancing cooperation in the JHA area. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted EU leaders to enhance cooperation in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) area. Law enforcement efforts post-attacks led to arrests in several European countries, highlighting the need for improved coordination due to open borders and differing legal systems within the EU. The EU's open borders and legal differences allowed terrorists to move freely and evade capture. Lack of anti-terrorist legislation and slow extradition processes hindered efforts to combat terrorism. EU leaders recognized the need for a supportive role in addressing cross-border terrorist threats after the 2001 attacks. The EU recognized the need to support national governments in countering terrorism and took steps to harmonize laws, enhance information sharing, establish common definitions, and improve border controls. Measures included creating a common list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to combat terrorist financing, and strengthening Europol and Eurojust. The EU implemented new measures to strengthen external border controls and enhance aviation security, as well as bolstering Europol and Eurojust. Following incidents like the 2004 Madrid bombings and the 2005 London bombings, the EU established a Counterterrorism Coordinator to improve intelligence sharing and implement agreed policies. The Counterterrorism Coordinator in the EU was tasked with improving intelligence sharing and promoting already agreed policies. The 2005 London bombings raised concerns about homegrown Islamist extremism and the integration of Muslims into European society. In response, the EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment with three main goals. In December 2005, the EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream voices over extremism, and enhancing security and justice. The EU expanded its definition of terrorism in 2008 to include new criminal offenses related to terrorist recruitment, training, and public provocation, aiming to facilitate prosecution and counter terrorist propaganda online. EU officials established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite political commitment to enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, forging common policies remains a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. Despite political commitment to enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, forging common policies remains a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. National police and intelligence services are often reluctant to share information with each other or with EU bodies such as Europol, complicating harmonizing laws or concluding EU-wide policies in the JHA field. EU policymakers are increasingly alarmed by the growing number of European citizens and residents training and fighting with terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa. EU policymakers are concerned about the increasing number of European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa, with up to 5,000 EU citizens estimated to have traveled to fight in conflict zones since 2011. Security services fear the potential threat posed by trained militants returning to Europe and individuals inspired by extremist propaganda to carry out attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about links to the Islamic State and other extremist groups. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, such as those in Brussels, Paris, and Copenhagen, have raised concerns about the influence of extremist propaganda on individuals carrying out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. These attacks have been linked to the Islamic State and other extremist groups abroad. The attacks in Europe included shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, a thwarted train attack from Amsterdam to Paris, and coordinated attacks in Paris in 2015, all carried out by individuals with ties to extremist groups. In November 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. Authorities confirmed the identities of seven assailants, all French or Belgian citizens, with ties to the Islamic State. European governments struggle with monitoring potential attackers and lack information sharing among law enforcement agencies. The Schengen system has been exploited by some perpetrators. The Paris attacks in November 2015 left 130 dead and over 350 injured. European governments face challenges in monitoring potential attackers due to insufficient information sharing among law enforcement agencies. Some attackers exploited the Schengen system and the chaos caused by the influx of migrants and refugees entering Europe. Perpetrators traveled between European countries before the attacks, with some having connections to Syria. The November attackers entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. One suspect in the Paris attacks entered Belgium from France the morning after but is still at large. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and foreign fighters due to sovereignty issues and the need to balance security with human rights. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and foreign fighters due to sovereignty issues. Progress has been made in enhancing information sharing among national authorities to address the evolving foreign fighter threat. Key steps include encouraging the use of common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. EU databases, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database, are used for collecting and analyzing information on suspected criminals, forged documents, stolen property, and European fighters. Europol's European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) was established in 2016 for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states to monitor and investigate foreign terrorist fighters, illegal firearms trafficking, and terrorist financing. Success of these initiatives depends on receiving information from national authorities, with some experts noting that EU-wide information sharing on terrorism still falls short. EU officials have seen an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases, but some believe that EU-wide information sharing on terrorism is still lacking. The proposal for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system has been stalled since 2013 due to data privacy concerns, but gained momentum after the 2015 Paris attacks. The system aims to facilitate information sharing on foreign fighters and help identify unknown terrorist suspects. EU officials pushed for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system after the 2015 Paris attacks to enhance information sharing on foreign fighters and identify terrorist suspects. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, obliging airlines to provide PNR data for flights in and out of EU territory. Member states can also collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier economic operators for harmonization across the EU. The EU is implementing a Passenger Name Record (PNR) system to share data on foreign fighters and terrorist suspects. Member states can collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. Critics argue it infringes on data privacy rights, while others feel it doesn't go far enough in sharing data effectively. EU governments have two years to implement the agreement's provisions. The EU is implementing a Passenger Name Record (PNR) system to share data on foreign fighters and terrorist suspects. Member states can collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. EU governments have two years to implement the agreement's provisions, including strengthening external EU border controls. Concerns about the foreign fighter threat led to calls for increased security tools at the EU's external borders, but resistance to amending the Schengen Borders Code remains due to fears of potential reimposition of internal border controls. The surge of migrants and refugees in 2015 and the Paris attacks have put pressure on the Schengen system. In mid-December 2015, the European Commission proposed targeted modifications to the Schengen Borders Code, including mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders. They also suggested creating a new European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen border security. Previous attempts to establish an EU border guard corps faced challenges regarding national sovereignty concerns. The EU has established the European Border and Coast Guard to reinforce member states' capacities at the external borders through joint operations and rapid interventions. Efforts to establish an \"EU border guard corps\" have faced challenges due to concerns about national sovereignty. The EU is also focused on preventing radicalization by detecting and removing online content that promotes terrorism, as well as developing communication strategies to counter terrorist ideologies. In July 2015, the EU set up an Internet Referral Unit to monitor and remove terrorist content online, and in December 2015, they launched an Internet Forum to collaborate with technology companies on countering terrorist propaganda. The EU is working on revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. They are also calling on member states to address societal factors contributing to radicalization, and working with service providers to remove terrorist propaganda online. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training. Efforts to harmonize criminal laws in the EU have faced challenges due to varying national policies, but updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. In December 2015, the European Commission proposed revising the EU's common terrorism definition in response to the foreign fighter threat. The EU is revising its common terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat, in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The European Commission proposed this revision in December 2015, aiming to enhance cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism. This initiative has been welcomed by the U.S. government and Congress, as it aims to root out terrorist cells in Europe and beyond that may pose a threat to U.S. interests. The U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism aims to root out terrorist cells in Europe and beyond that could threaten the United States or its interests. This partnership has led to a new dynamic in U.S.-EU relations, fostering dialogue on law enforcement and homeland security issues. The Obama Administration has supported cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security, viewing the evolving partnership positively. President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasizes working with European allies bilaterally and with the European Parliament and Union to advance counterterrorism efforts for mutual security. The United States partners with the European Union and Parliament to advance counterterrorism efforts for mutual security. The EU is a key U.S. partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, focusing on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. US-EU cooperation aims to address concerns about recruitment of European and American Muslims by Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. Cooperation between the United States and the European Union focuses on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon, particularly concerning European and American Muslims recruited by Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. U.S. policymakers express concerns about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to address the influx of violent extremists. The White House mentioned close collaboration between U.S. officials and EU counterparts in combating this issue. In September 2014, the White House noted close collaboration between U.S. and EU officials to address the foreign fighter threat. EU countries support U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the global foreign fighter phenomenon. Most EU member states are backing the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. After the January 2015 Paris attacks, the U.S. Attorney General joined an emergency meeting of European and North American interior ministers to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. In the aftermath of the Paris attacks in January 2015, high-ranking European and EU officials participated in a conference on countering violent extremism hosted by the United States. U.S. officials have been urging European governments and the EU to enhance information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases to combat terrorism. President Obama called on the EU to implement long-awaited agreements following the November 2015 attacks in Paris. Following the Paris attacks, U.S. officials support the establishment of an EU PNR system to share passenger information and prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in tracking terrorist financing and sharing airline passenger data. Challenges remain in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, including data privacy concerns complicating negotiations. Challenges persist in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, with data privacy concerns complicating negotiations on information-sharing agreements. Other issues include detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and balancing border security with facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Legislation passed in 2015 to enhance the security of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program also addresses concerns about Europeans joining or being influenced by the Islamic State. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, strengthening U.S.-EU ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings occurring regularly. The U.S.-EU working group meets every six months to discuss police and judicial cooperation. The Secretary of State, U.S. Attorney General, and Secretary of Homeland Security meet annually with their EU counterparts. A U.S.-EU working group meets every six months to discuss police and judicial cooperation against terrorism. There is also a regular dialogue on terrorist financing and a high-level policy dialogue on border and transport security. Expert-level dialogues on critical infrastructure protection and preventing violent extremism have taken place, with reciprocal liaison relationships established between U.S. and EU agencies. Europol and U.S. agencies have established reciprocal liaison relationships, with officers stationed in Washington, DC, and The Hague. They collaborate on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime, supporting approximately 500 cases a year. This partnership has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes, including the 2014 operation against online \"dark net\" marketplaces. Additionally, a U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague since 2006. Efforts between the U.S. and EU in countering transnational crimes, including terrorism, have led to various agreements and collaborations. This includes operations against online \"dark net\" marketplaces selling illicit products. U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague since 2006 to facilitate cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors. Accords have been made to improve police and judicial cooperation, with agreements allowing the sharing of strategic and personal information between U.S. law enforcement authorities and Europol. Negotiations between the U.S. and EU on personal information accord were challenging due to concerns about data protection standards. EU regulations prioritize privacy rights and limit data access by law enforcement. Data protection issues also delayed negotiations on the 2006 U.S.-Eurojust cooperation agreement. In 2007, a common security standards agreement was signed, and in 2010, extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties were ratified. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance were ratified to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. The U.S.-EU extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties address challenges such as the death penalty and extradition of EU nationals. The agreements modernize existing bilateral accords, streamline information exchange, and set rules for competing extradition requests. The MLA treaty grants U.S. access to European financial information and expedites request processing. The MLA treaty sets rules for priority in competing extradition requests between the US and EU, granting US access to European financial information and expediting request processing. Despite growing US-EU ties in law enforcement, critics question the utility of collaborating with EU bodies due to existing bilateral relations and limitations of Europol. Europol's effectiveness relies on national services sharing information. European officials criticize the US for not sharing intelligence. Despite challenges, US and European officials are committed to enhancing cooperation with Europol. New agreements aim to improve collaboration against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. European officials are committed to enhanced cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. In early 2015, U.S. and Europol officials signed agreements to improve collaboration against foreign fighters and illegal immigration, especially by organized crime groups. The United States and the EU work together to track and suppress terrorist financing, including through global forums like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force. The U.S. benefits from accessing financial data through SWIFT as part of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The U.S. has an agreement with SWIFT, a consortium of international banks, allowing access to financial data for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. This program has helped prevent terrorist attacks in Europe, but remains controversial due to privacy concerns. U.S. and EU officials have collaborated since 2001 to combat terrorist activities. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and the other on non-affiliated entities. The lists are regularly updated and include groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and the Islamic State. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide. Law enforcement measures differ for those considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. For \"external\" persons and groups, all EU member states must freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance. For \"internal\" persons and groups, inclusion on the list leads to strengthened police cooperation measures. National governments also impose their own sanctions to cut off financing. The EU's common terrorist list includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide. National governments generally seek to apply their own sanctions to stem financing for listed individuals and entities. Unanimous agreement among all EU member states is required to add or remove a person or entity from the list. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add several organizations to the list, such as PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The US has also included members of ETA in its terrorist designation lists, taking cues from the EU. The EU's common terrorist list includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide. National governments seek to apply their own sanctions to stem financing for listed individuals and entities. The United States has also added members of the Basque separatist group ETA to its terrorist designation lists, following the EU's lead. However, there are frictions in fully harmonizing the U.S. and EU terrorist designation lists. The EU hesitates to add suspected Hamas-related charities to its list, viewing them as separate entities engaged in political or social work. Some charities designated as Hamas fronts by the U.S., like Interpal, have been investigated by European authorities and cleared of funding terrorist activities. EU member states have been divided on this issue for many years. EU member states have been divided on whether to include Hezbollah on the EU's common terrorist list. The United States considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization and applies sanctions. Some EU countries support adding Hezbollah to the list, while others oppose it, citing concerns about managing relations with Lebanon. In 2012-2013, there was a renewed debate within the EU on adding Hezbollah to the common terrorist list, following events like the Burgas airport bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus. Some EU members were hesitant due to Hezbollah's role in Lebanon's government and its social services in poor communities. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its common terrorist list due to their involvement in attacks in Bulgaria and Cyprus, as well as their support of the Syrian government. This decision was seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon. The decision allowed for continued dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and humanitarian assistance from the EU. The move was symbolic, sending a message against terrorist activities within the EU. The EU's decision to add Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013 was largely symbolic, sending a message against terrorist activities within the EU. Some experts hoped this would lead to increased intelligence investigations into Hezbollah's activities in Europe. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as it still allowed fundraising in Europe. The EU's decision to add Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013 was symbolic, but critics argued it was insufficient as fundraising in Europe was still allowed. US administrations and Congress urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization following the Burgas bombing in 2013. The EU added Hezbollah to its terrorist list, following calls from the US Congress. Data privacy remains a key issue between the US and EU, with differences in regulations and concerns over sharing information. The EU considers privacy of communications and protection of personal data as human rights, with regulations setting common rules for entities in the EU. Concerns have been raised in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords about the level of protection for European citizens' data, especially after unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs. The unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs have strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about EU citizens' privacy rights. Many analysts worry about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, especially given the opposition from MEPs. EU regulations emphasize the importance of protecting personal data in information-sharing accords. MEPs in the European Parliament have opposed U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record agreement. In response to U.S. surveillance programs, the Parliament established a working group chaired by Claude Moraes, which criticized NSA's mass surveillance programs in the \"Moraes report\" adopted in March 2014. The European Parliament's working group, led by Claude Moraes, criticized NSA's mass surveillance programs in the \"Moraes report\" adopted in March 2014. The report raised concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements like the PNR accord and SWIFT agreement, urging the U.S. to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens and provide judicial remedies for violations. The European Parliament's \"Moraes report\" criticized NSA's surveillance programs and called for stronger data protection rules, including judicial remedies for EU citizens. The Parliament demanded revisions to U.S. legislation to recognize privacy rights and ensure safeguards for data transferred outside the EU. In December 2015, political agreement was reached on new data protection rules. The EU reached political agreement on new data protection rules in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials and business leaders about potential impacts on U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. U.S. officials have reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight. The U.S. aims to address EU concerns and maintain support for agreements like SWIFT and PNR through transparency efforts. The U.S. government has been working to address EU concerns about NSA surveillance, particularly the PRISM program. A high-level U.S.-EU working group was established to discuss the implications for privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to restore transatlantic trust. U.S. and EU policymakers are considering implementing some of the Commission's proposals. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to work with Congress to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was passed in February 2016 to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. Controversy over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program surfaced in 2006, with concerns about U.S. access to SWIFT financial data. In 2007, a deal was reached to allow continued access for counterterrorism purposes, but some remained worried about EU rights and data privacy. The Judicial Redress Act was passed in February 2016 to address European concerns and restore transatlantic trust. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture required a new U.S.-EU agreement for data sharing. The European Parliament gained the right to approve or reject international agreements like the SWIFT accord. In February 2010, the Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement. In February 2010, the European Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. This led to negotiations for a revised agreement to address Parliament's concerns. In May 2010, negotiations began for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement addressing concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Key concerns included judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. and the use of \"bulk data\" transfers. Some MEPs called for more targeted transfers and greater supervision over U.S. access to SWIFT data. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded, allowing for administrative and legal redress. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded between U.S. and EU officials, allowing for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the United States. Some MEPs called for greater supervision over U.S. access to SWIFT data, leading to additional changes in the draft agreement. These changes included the appointment of an independent observer by the European Commission in Washington, DC, to oversee the extraction of SWIFT data. The final iteration of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord, approved by the European Parliament in July 2010, included changes such as appointing an independent observer in Washington, DC, to oversee SWIFT data extraction. It also required the European Commission to present plans for a \"European TFTP\" within a year to enable the EU to extract and transfer SWIFT data to the U.S. without bulk data transfers. The agreement entered into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period, with automatic extensions unless notified otherwise. The U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement entered into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period, with automatic extensions unless notified otherwise. Some MEPs expressed concerns about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and criticized Europol for approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended measures to make the TFTP more transparent, including providing more information to Europol in writing. In December 2012, the Commission released the results of a second review of the agreement, which concluded that the TFTP had provided concrete benefits in the fight against terrorism. In December 2012, the Commission released the results of a second review of the TFTP agreement, confirming its benefits in fighting terrorism. Unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance activities in Europe since June 2013 have raised concerns about data handling. In October 2013, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to NSA monitoring allegations. However, actually suspending the accord would require action from the European Commission and member states, which they are not inclined to do. Reviews of the TFTP program show that SWIFT data has been beneficial in investigating terrorist threats. In late 2013 and mid-2014, reviews of the TFTP program showed that SWIFT data provided significant leads for European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats, including during the 2012 London Olympics and threats posed by EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The initial agreement in May 2004 between the United States and EU allowed airlines to provide passenger name record data to U.S. authorities, but it was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns for EU citizens. In response to privacy concerns, the European Parliament challenged the PNR agreement in the EU Court of Justice, leading to its annulment in May 2006. However, a new seven-year agreement was reached in July 2007 between the United States and the EU, allowing the transfer of PNR data with provisions for sharing information to combat terrorism. The new seven-year agreement between the United States and the EU allows the transfer of PNR data with provisions for sharing information to combat terrorism. Key details include extending data storage time to 15 years, allowing access to sensitive passenger information, and requiring airlines to send data 72 hours before a flight. The number of data fields collected was reduced from 34 to 19. The United States agreed to reduce the number of fields from 34 to 19 for data collection in the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement. The European Parliament had to approve the agreement for it to remain in force, but many MEPs objected to key elements such as the amount of data transferred and data retention period. Concerns were raised about potential data misuse by U.S. authorities for \"data mining\" or \"data profiling\" purposes. Despite these objections, the Parliament agreed to postpone its vote on the agreement in May 2010 to avoid legal uncertainties and practical difficulties for travelers and air carriers. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement to avoid legal uncertainties and practical difficulties for travelers and air carriers. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission, which was issued in September 2010. This strategy included principles such as using PNR data exclusively for combating terrorism, providing clear information to passengers about data exchange, and ensuring passengers have the right to redress. The Commission emphasized using PNR data solely for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers, ensuring their right to redress, limiting data categories, and retaining data for the shortest time necessary. In November 2010, the European Parliament supported the Commission's PNR strategy and called for new negotiations with the U.S., emphasizing the need for data exchange to be necessary and proportional, and prohibiting data mining or profiling. The European Parliament supported new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for data exchange to be necessary and proportional. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord, leading to negotiations in December 2010. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights, citing joint reviews confirming no misuse of PNR data. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House (H.Res. 255) and passed in the Senate (S.Res. 174) essentially supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urging DHS to reject any efforts by the EU to modify the agreement in a way that would degrade its usefulness in the fight against terrorism. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a new PNR agreement. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement, introducing new provisions to enhance passenger data protection. This included depersonalizing and masking portions of a passenger's record after six months, reducing the time PNR data is stored, and limiting access to authorized personnel. U.S. officials believed the draft accord provided greater legal certainty and clarity on passenger rights to redress. The revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement introduced new provisions to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing and masking data after six months, limiting access to authorized personnel, and not allowing denial of boarding based solely on automated processing. Despite revisions, some MEPs were still unsatisfied as the agreement allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years. Some MEPs remained unsatisfied with the U.S.-EU PNR agreement, citing concerns about data retention for up to 15 years, increased data transmission requirements, and broader use of PNR data for criminal offenses. In October 2011, a hearing on intelligence-sharing and terrorist travel highlighted the negotiations on the agreement. U.S. officials defended the May 2011 draft as stronger than the 2007 version. In November 2011, the United States and the EU concluded a new draft PNR agreement, addressing all concerns raised by the EU and containing \"real improvements\" over the previous version. Additional changes were made to meet EU demands. In November 2011, the United States and the EU finalized a new draft PNR agreement with improvements and changes to meet EU demands. The agreement limited the use of PNR data to serious crimes with varying retention times based on the type of crime. Despite approval from EU member states, Germany and Austria abstained due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. The new U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament, with Germany and Austria abstaining due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs believed the changes were cosmetic and should be rejected, while others supported the agreement citing stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. Despite some misgivings, some MEPs voted for the 2011 accord to provide airlines with legal certainty. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with 409 votes in favor, 226 against, and 33 abstentions. The agreement reaffirmed the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. It was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and entered into force on August 8, 2012, valid for seven years with the possibility of renewal for another seven years. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved on April 19, 2012, valid for seven years with the option for renewal. In November 2013, the European Commission praised the agreement's effectiveness in combating terrorism. However, concerns arose about U.S. data protection following surveillance allegations, leading to questions from MEPs. The Parliament's March 2014 resolution called for clarification on U.S. laws protecting PNR data. MEPs have raised questions about the PNR program and concerns about U.S. laws protecting PNR data saved in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders view information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in fighting terrorism. Washington has sought an umbrella agreement with the EU to ease negotiations on data-sharing accords. The EU and US have been working on establishing an umbrella agreement for data privacy standards to facilitate future data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a framework agreement to protect personal data in the fight against terrorism and crime. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate in 2010 for negotiating such an accord to ensure high standards of data protection on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU and US are working on an umbrella agreement for data privacy standards to facilitate future data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. The agreement aims to bridge U.S.-EU differences in privacy rights and ensure high standards of data protection on both sides. Specific agreements on SWIFT or PNR would still be required for actual data transfers. The U.S. and EU launched negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) based on mutual recognition of data protection systems. The US and EU are negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) based on mutual recognition of data protection systems. Progress has been made on provisions related to data security, transparency of data processing, and oversight. The goal is for the EU to find US data protection standards adequate. In June 2012, U.S. and EU officials made progress in negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA), focusing on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues included purpose limitation, retention times, and redress for EU citizens seeking judicial redress in the U.S. through the Privacy Act of 1974. EU officials pushed for extending judicial redress to EU citizens, while U.S. Administrations argued that redress could be sought through other means like agency administrative redress or U.S. laws such as the Freedom of Information Act. Successive U.S. Administrations countered that EU citizens could seek redress concerning U.S. government handling of personal information through agency administrative redress or U.S. laws like the Freedom of Information Act. The DPPA negotiations were stalled due to the lack of judicial redress, but gained momentum after revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013. The European Parliament called for the resumption of DPPA negotiations without delay, emphasizing the need for judicial redress for EU citizens. The European Parliament urged the resumption of DPPA negotiations without delay, emphasizing the need for judicial redress for EU citizens. In response, the Obama Administration committed to seeking legislation to provide EU citizens with the right to seek judicial redress for privacy violations. The Obama Administration committed to providing EU citizens with the right to seek judicial redress for privacy violations, leading to the finalization of the DPPA text. Legislation was introduced to meet EU demands for judicial redress, with the EU waiting to sign the DPPA until U.S. judicial redress legislation was adopted. In March 2015, legislation known as the Judicial Redress Act was introduced by Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers, and Senators Murphy and Hatch. The Act aimed to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries with privacy agreements, such as the EU, in relation to the DPPA. This was significant following a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015. The Judicial Redress Act was introduced to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries with privacy agreements, such as the EU, in relation to the DPPA. This was significant following the CJEU ruling invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate protection of personal data and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The Act aimed to address European concerns about data transfers and strengthen confidence in the commercial sector. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address European concerns about data transfers and strengthen confidence in the commercial sector. However, the scope of judicial redress in the U.S. legislation may not fully align with EU standards, raising questions about its effectiveness in meeting EU \"adequacy\" standards or easing concerns about U.S. government access to personal data in the commercial sector. The Redress Act, H.R. 1428, passed by the House and Senate with amendments, aims to align with EU standards on data transfers and address concerns about U.S. government access to personal data in the commercial sector. The Cornyn amendment added provisions to ensure the Act applies only to countries allowing data transfer to the U.S. without impeding national security interests. This may have influenced the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield agreement. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, was signed into law on February 24, 2016, as P.L. 114-126. Its enactment is seen as crucial for the formal signature of the U.S.-EU DPPA. The EU welcomed the act, stating it will help restore trust in transatlantic data flows and pave the way for the DPPA's signature. Approval by EU member states and the European Parliament is required for the DPPA to take effect, a process that could take several months. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported that 30,000 passengers and 3,000 commercial containers arrive daily from Europe at U.S. ports of entry. The United States and the EU have emphasized cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security, with agreements on information exchanges and biometric identifiers. In January 2010, they pledged to strengthen aviation security measures. In January 2010, the United States and the EU pledged to intensify efforts to strengthen aviation security measures worldwide. U.S.-EU collaboration played a key role in forging an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) declaration on aviation security in October 2010, agreed to by 190 countries. They have also worked together to improve cargo security and global supply chain security. In June 2011, they reaffirmed their determination to bolster supply chain security and foster greater global cooperation on this issue. U.S. and EU officials are balancing improving border security with facilitating legitimate transatlantic travel and commerce. Since 2001, the US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security due to incidents like the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot. Discussions continue on balancing border security with transatlantic travel and commerce. The US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security since 2001, following incidents like the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights were introduced in July 2014 due to fears of Al Qaeda-linked groups using devices to disguise explosives. Collaboration between the US and EU on aviation security is ongoing, with efforts to bridge gaps in policies for transatlantic flights. Since 2001, the US and EU have closely aligned rules and regulations for aviation security, with a focus on transatlantic flights. In 2003, EU countries objected to US rules on armed air marshals, leading to discussions on alternative measures. In 2008, an agreement was reached on coordinating air cargo security measures, including 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights to comply with the 9/11 Commission Act. The US and EU have agreed on an air cargo security partnership to ensure the screening of all cargo on passenger flights, complying with the 9/11 Commission Act. This partnership aims to eliminate duplication of security controls and enhance cargo security, resulting in savings for operators in terms of time and money. The US and EU have agreed on a mutual recognition of air cargo security regimes to enhance cargo security, save time and money for operators, improve transatlantic shipments, and exchange information on security regime implementation. Despite shared commitment, some differences in perspective remain. In 2007, the US and EU agreed on mutual recognition of air cargo security regimes. After a failed 2009 attack, the US accelerated body scanner installation at airports and encouraged the EU to do the same. Some EU countries hesitated due to privacy and health concerns, but in 2011, the European Parliament approved body scanners with privacy safeguards. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy safeguards, including stick figure images only and a ban on x-ray scans. The use of scanners should be voluntary, with passengers able to opt for a manual search. The European Commission adopted these conditions in November 2011, but member states are not required to deploy such scanners. Some EU officials have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports due to the large number of European visitors. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced in January 2013 that it would replace revealing body scanners with ones that produce more generic images by June 2013. This decision addressed privacy and health concerns in Europe and the U.S., where officials and lawmakers had expressed worries about violating passengers' privacy rights. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced in January 2013 that it would replace revealing body scanners with ones that use millimeter wave technology instead of low-dose x-rays. Concerns about violating passengers' privacy rights were raised by Members of Congress and the European Parliament. The United States and the EU have been working to harmonize restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage to minimize inconvenience to international travelers. The EU planned to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, but concerns about security and potential flight delays led to a postponement. The US and EU have been working to harmonize restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage to minimize inconvenience to international travelers. The EU postponed its 2013 deadline for liquid screening equipment and restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. In January 2014, duty-free liquids and gels were allowed in cabin baggage, with plans to lift all restrictions by January 2016. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, including extending the US Container Security Initiative (CSI) in EU ports. The US and EU have mutual recognition of trusted shipper programs to enhance supply chain security and trade opportunities. This agreement benefits 15,000 trusted traders by expediting customs procedures and focusing resources on risky consignments. The US and EU have mutual recognition of trusted shipper programs under the AEO regime to simplify procedures for trusted traders and focus resources on risky consignments. Recent tensions over 100% container scanning have receded as EU officials found it unrealistic and costly, impacting trade and burdening EU ports and businesses. US policymakers shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% scanning, fearing lower profits and higher transportation costs for US importers. U.S. policymakers in the Bush and Obama Administrations shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% scanning, leading to deadline extensions. Proponents argue that current manifest data is insufficient for determining risk. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program and EU's desire for equal application to all member states have been points of contention. The U.S. and European authorities find current data inadequate for assessing container risk. Tensions arise from the EU's push for equal application of the Visa Waiver Program to all member states. New EU members sought inclusion in the VWP, citing visa reciprocity with the U.S. as a key issue. Some Members of Congress supported extending the VWP to new EU allies in NATO. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53), which included changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to strengthen security measures and allow more EU members to qualify. Some Members of Congress supported extending the VWP to new EU allies in NATO, while others were skeptical post-9/11 due to security concerns. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) made changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security measures and expand eligibility for more EU members. This included requiring countries to meet security and passport standards, share information agreements, and submit biographical information through ESTA. The Act also allowed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the VWP. Currently, 23 out of the EU's 28 member states are part of the VWP, with efforts ongoing to include the remaining five members. The EU encourages the US to admit the remaining five EU members (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania) to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). A revised EU reciprocity mechanism aims to achieve full visa reciprocity with the US and other countries exempt from EU visa requirements. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if full reciprocity is not met. The European Commission has not suspended visa-free travel for third country citizens under the new reciprocity mechanism. The VWP allows Europeans to easily return home and enter the US without a visa, raising concerns about security. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but additional biographic information is now required for VWP travelers through ESTA. The Obama Administration supports the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but additional biographic information is now required for VWP travelers through ESTA. Enhanced security measures have been introduced for VWP countries to enable more comprehensive screening of visitors while preserving legitimate trade and travel. Concerns about VWP security were heightened after the November 2015 attacks in Paris, leading to further changes announced by the Obama Administration to strengthen the program's security controls. Belgian citizens raised U.S. concerns about VWP security. In response, the Obama Administration made changes to the VWP, including modifying ESTA to capture travel to terrorist safe havens. Congress passed legislation to enhance VWP security, prohibiting certain individuals. In 2015, Congress passed legislation to enhance the security of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). The new law prohibits individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the U.S. under the VWP. All VWP participant countries must now issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) legislation was enhanced in 2015 to validate machine-readable passports at entry ports and implement screening protocols. In February 2016, DHS expanded travel restrictions to individuals who visited Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011. EU officials are concerned about the new requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. Many European policymakers doubt the effectiveness of the legislation, stating it may impact legitimate travelers but not detect potential threats. Many European policymakers question the effectiveness of the new Visa Waiver Program (VWP) legislation, suggesting it may impact legitimate travelers but not detect potential threats. U.S. officials highlight exemptions for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS having authority to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. EU leaders warn of possible \"reciprocal measures\" if restrictions are imposed on U.S. citizens for visa-free travel to Europe. Members of Congress also express concerns about the provisions in the new law. EU leaders have warned about possible \"reciprocal measures\" if restrictions are imposed on U.S. citizens for visa-free travel to Europe. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals, aiming to prevent discrimination based on ethnicity. This move could potentially reduce the likelihood of the EU imposing reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens. U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security. The EU has warned of possible reciprocal visa requirements if restrictions are placed on U.S. citizens for visa-free travel to Europe. U.S. and European officials stress the need to balance freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. Tensions between the U.S. and Europe have been fueled by issues such as the treatment of suspected terrorist detainees, including policies like the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" The European media focused on U.S. policies regarding enemy combatants, military commissions, \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" extraordinary rendition, and CIA detention facilities in Europe. Many European leaders criticized these policies as breaching international and European law, degrading human rights values, and weakening U.S. and European cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Some detainees at Guant\u00e1namo and subjected to U.S. rendition were European citizens or residents. The U.S. detainee and interrogation policies were criticized by European leaders for breaching international law and human rights values. The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial in the fight against terrorism, denying any violations of human rights commitments. Frictions between the U.S. and EU over detainee policies have eased under the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration sought agreements with foreign governments to accept some Guant\u00e1namo detainees, while maintaining that certain prisoners were too dangerous to be released. U.S.-EU frictions over terrorist detainee policies have subsided since Obama took office. EU officials welcomed Obama's plans to close Guant\u00e1namo, ban torture, and review Bush Administration legal opinions on detention and interrogation methods. In March 2009, a special envoy was appointed to persuade countries to accept detainees cleared for release but unable to return to their country of origin. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility, with some EU countries accepting released detainees while others declined. Congressional opposition and restrictions hindered the Administration's efforts to transfer detainees, leading to obstacles in the closure process. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to Congressional restrictions on transferring detainees. In March 2011, an executive order established indefinite detention for dangerous detainees. European concerns include Guant\u00e1namo's role as a recruitment tool for terrorist groups and the well-being of detainees. Some European policymakers worry that Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups and have concerns about the well-being of detainees. In May 2013, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the United States to close the facility. President Obama renewed his commitment to closing Guant\u00e1namo in December 2013, with Congress passing a measure easing restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees. In 2015, Congress maintained restrictions on bringing Guant\u00e1namo detainees to the US but required a plan for closing the facility. President Obama submitted a proposal to Congress in 2016 and called for help in closing the facility before the end of his term in 2017. 147 detainees have been resettled overseas out of almost 800 detained since 2002. President Obama submitted a proposal to Congress on February 23, 2016, to close the Guant\u00e1namo facility before the end of his term in January 2017. Out of almost 800 detainees, 147 have been resettled overseas during his administration, with 91 detainees remaining in Guant\u00e1namo as of February 2016. European concerns persist regarding the past involvement of European governments in U.S. terrorist detainee policies, with the European Parliament calling for investigations into CIA detention facilities and rendition practices. The European Parliament has directed committees to investigate the role of EU member states in hosting alleged CIA detention facilities and aiding CIA flights related to terrorism suspects. This follows calls for full investigations into the existence of CIA detention facilities on EU territories and disclosure of relevant information on suspected CIA rendition flights. The Parliament's resolution also urged the United States to investigate and prosecute human rights violations resulting from CIA programs and cooperate with EU requests. The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on the CIA's detention and interrogation programs called for the U.S. to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to the CIA programs. Concerns exist about potential risks to U.S.-European intelligence cooperation due to allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against CIA officers in EU states. Previous administrations and Congress have supported enhancing U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism since the 2001 attacks. U.S. administrations and Congress have supported U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism since the 2001 attacks. Collaboration with the EU on police and judicial matters was deemed beneficial despite initial concerns. Improved cooperation aims to track suspected terrorists and prevent their entry into the U.S. or sanctuary in Europe, although challenges exist due to differing EU and member state competencies. Counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and the European Union is aimed at tracking suspected terrorists and preventing their entry into the US or sanctuary in Europe. However, challenges arise from differing EU and member state competencies, as well as US policy preferences. Despite occasional tensions, both sides are committed to closer cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism, law enforcement, and border controls. The United States and the European Union are committed to closer cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism is crucial in combating threats from European and American citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S border control measures, and visa policy are key issues for Congress that could impact future cooperation. Hearings in the 113th and 114th Congresses have focused on the threats posed by Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, hearings focused on threats from Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to enhance security controls. Intelligence reforms and data privacy laws could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. EU officials are monitoring potential changes to U.S. surveillance laws. Possible changes to U.S. surveillance laws could affect U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. EU officials view the U.S. Judicial Redress Act positively as a step towards rebuilding trust. The European Parliament's influence in counterterrorism areas may increase, allowing Members of Congress to shape its views. Members of Congress may play a role in shaping the European Parliament's views on international agreements and U.S. surveillance practices. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament on potential changes to U.S. surveillance laws, urging cooperation to protect both nations. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities. In late 2013, Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities with European officials and reaffirm close U.S.-European relations. Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians have expressed interest in strengthening ties and cooperation between the two bodies. Such exchanges could enhance transatlantic relations. In recent years, Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians have shown interest in strengthening ties and cooperation between the two bodies, providing opportunities for enhancing transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
