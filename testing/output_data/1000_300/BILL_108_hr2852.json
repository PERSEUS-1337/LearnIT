    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to cord blood stem cells. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Cord blood is a source of stem cells that can be collected without risk to the donor. Cord blood, containing stem cells, can be collected from the placenta and umbilical cord after childbirth. It can be preserved for years and used for transplantation or research. Advantages over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications. In bone marrow transplantation, finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for success. Patients of ethnic minorities often struggle to find fully matched donors, leading to partially matched transplants with higher risks. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donor supply, providing fully matched and partially matched transplant options for minorities. This reduces complications like graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Identifying unrelated bone marrow donors from the National registry is crucial. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can provide matches for 90% of those needing transplants within days. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, reducing complications like graft versus host disease and mortality. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, a genetic condition more prevalent in certain ethnic groups like African-Americans, have a high risk of severe bacterial infections and painful crises. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured 80% of children with this disease. The median life-span of patients with Sickle Cell Disease is 42 years, with severe cases in childhood rarely living beyond 20 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has successfully cured patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, especially beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients due to less stringent matching requirements compared to bone marrow transplants. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank is crucial for increasing the chances of finding suitable donors. An African American patient has a higher chance of finding a suitable cord blood donor compared to a bone marrow donor. With a national cord blood bank of 150,000 units, 90% of African American patients with conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia could find appropriately matched stem cells for treatment. The National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants since 1987, but cord blood transplantation is essential for non-caucasoid patients who struggle to find suitable matches. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation for non-caucasoid patients who struggle to find suitable matches. Radiation exposure may lead to bone marrow failure, requiring cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units for treatment. Exposed individuals also face an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma in the future. Recent scientific developments suggest that research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network under section 376A. This network aims to advance research on cord blood stem cells for chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is established under the Public Health Service Act to advance research on cord blood stem cells for chronic diseases. Definitions in the section include terms like Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, and human cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established under the Public Health Service Act, includes hematopoietic stem cells and other stem cells from neonatal blood collected after birth. The Secretary contracts with qualified banks to create a network with at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The National Network of Cord Blood Stem Cell Banks aims to acquire, test, store, and make available at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells for transplantation purposes and research. The National Network of Cord Blood Stem Cell Banks aims to acquire, test, store, and make available at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells for transplantation purposes and research. Eligible donor banks must have obtained all necessary licenses, certifications, and registrations, implement donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients, and allocate up to 10 percent of the cord blood inventory for research each year. The eligible donor banks must have implemented donor screening and cord blood collection practices to protect donors and recipients, ensure confidentiality, and encourage donation by a diverse group of donors. The eligible donor banks must have systems for communication with other cord blood stem cell banks, transplant centers, and physicians, and for tracking recipients' clinical outcomes. They must also educate the public about cord blood donation. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established in 1996, tracks recipients' clinical outcomes and educates the public about the benefits of donating cord blood stem cells. The Network is administered by a Board of Directors, including a chairperson, who oversees the national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinates donor banks. The Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established in 1996, includes a national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinates donor banks. The Board of Directors, appointed by the Secretary, consists of members from transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, and cord blood recipients. The curr_chunk mentions participants such as birthing hospitals, cord blood stem cell research community, transplant recipients, family members, social science experts, general public, and the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation. The Board of Directors includes members from various organizations such as birthing hospitals, cord blood stem cell research community, transplant recipients, family members, social science experts, general public, and the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation. Members can serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, except for nonvoting members and network donor banks. The Board is appointed annually to ensure continuity. The Board of Directors ensures continuity by having approximately 1/3 of members' terms expire each year. A member can continue serving until a successor is appointed. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry in the Network will operate a system for acquiring and distributing donated cord blood units, provide a website for searching donor matches, and maintain a database for documenting cord blood unit activities. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry in the Network will maintain a database to document the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation of cord blood units, as well as the clinical outcomes of transplantations. The database will operate according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality, and the Administrator will report to the Secretary periodically on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The Administrator will report to the Secretary on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's activities. The Board of Directors will ensure that donor banks meet requirements and that collection sites are geographically distributed throughout the United States. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network and their birthing hospital collection sites must be geographically distributed throughout the United States. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
