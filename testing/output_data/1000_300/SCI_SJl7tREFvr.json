    "content": "The integration of a Knowledge Base (KB) into a neural dialogue agent is a key challenge in Conversational AI. Memory networks are effective in encoding KB information to generate fluent responses. However, memory can become full of latent representations during training, leading to the common strategy of randomly overwriting old entries. Memory dropout is introduced as a technique to encourage diversity in latent space by aging redundant memories and sampling new ones. This approach improves dialogue generation in the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset, achieving a +2.2 BLEU points increase in response generation and an 8.1% increase in named entity recognition. The approach of integrating semantic information from personal knowledge bases improves dialogue generation by +2.2 BLEU points and named entity recognition by +8.1%. Leveraging contextual information from a knowledge base allows for answering queries based on personal data, challenging existing neural dialogue agents that struggle to interface with structured data. Memory networks have been effective in encoding knowledge base information to generate fluent responses, but there is a lack of work in regularizing the latent representations stored in external memory. A new approach called memory dropout is proposed to reduce overfitting in memory networks, designed specifically for their long-term nature. Unlike conventional dropout techniques, memory dropout does not immediately remove redundant memories with some probability. The new regularization method called memory dropout is designed for Memory Augmented Neural Networks to reduce overfitting by delaying the removal of redundant memories. It is a unique approach compared to traditional dropout techniques and aims to improve the long-term performance of memory networks. Our work introduces memory dropout as a regularization technique for Memory Augmented Neural Networks, aiming to reduce overfitting. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a neural dialogue agent, showing improved response generation performance on the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset. The technique involves incorporating knowledge base information into an external memory for better response accuracy and fluency. The memory dropout neural model aims to increase diversity in latent representations stored in an external memory. It incorporates normalized latent representations into long-term memory, forming neighborhoods of similar entries. An external memory augments neural encoder capacity by preserving latent representations. The memory dropout neural model utilizes an external memory to store long-term latent representations, increasing diversity. It defines a memory network with arrays to store keys and values, extended with arrays for age and variance. The goal is to learn a mathematical space with maximum margin between positive and negative memories while minimizing positive keys. This is achieved through a differentiable Gaussian Mixture Model to generate new positive embeddings. The differentiable Gaussian Mixture Model parameterizes positive memories with location and covariance matrix. Sampling from this distribution generates new positive embeddings. The collection of positive keys is represented as a linear superposition of Gaussian components. The variances stored in the array S help to avoid extreme embedding vectors dominating the likelihood probability. The mixing coefficients in Equation 1 quantify the similarity between the embedding vector h and the positive keys. The memory network consists of a neural encoder and an external memory that preserves longer versions of embeddings during training. The mixing coefficients quantify the similarity between the embedding vector and positive keys, with new keys generated from a Gaussian Mixture Model. Sampling from the distribution generates representative positive memories for the external memory. The memory network incorporates information encoded by a latent vector into a new key, resets its age, and computes its variance to address uncertainty. An aging mechanism penalizes redundant keys, and the model is applied to a dialogue system for automatic responses grounded in a Knowledge Base. The goal is to leverage contextual information in the KB to answer queries, challenging existing neural dialogue agents' assumptions about dialogue history carrying all necessary information. Our proposed architecture combines a Sequence-to-Sequence model for dialogue history and a Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) for encoding the Knowledge Base (KB). The Memory Network allows for generalization with fewer latent representations of the KB, even if they were only present during training. This approach decomposes the KB from its tabular format, inspired by previous work. The Memory Network in the neural dialogue model allows for generalization with fewer latent representations of the Knowledge Base (KB) by decomposing it into triplets. This approach is inspired by previous work and enhances the architecture of the dialogue model. The neural dialogue model incorporates a Knowledge Base (KB) using a Memory Network architecture with key-value format triplets. The model includes an LSTM encoder-decoder network for dialogue encoding and response generation. The neural dialogue model utilizes an LSTM encoder to create a context-sensitive hidden representation based on dialogue history and an LSTM decoder to generate responses. The decoder combines its hidden state with a memory module to predict the next response, using additive attention scores. The neural dialogue model uses LSTM encoder and decoder with a memory module for response prediction. The objective is to minimize cross entropy between actual and generated responses. Evaluation is done on the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset. The proposed method is evaluated on the Stanford Multi-Turn Dialogue dataset, which includes dialogues in the domain of an in-car assistant with personalized KB. Different types of KBs are used for queries. Comparison is made with baseline models like Seq2Seq+Attention Bahdanau et al. (2015). Neural Network with Memory Dropout (MANN+MD) is compared with baseline models like Seq2Seq+Attention and Key-Value Retrieval Network+Attention. The proposed model, Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN), includes no memory dropout mechanism and uses a word embedding size of 256. Training is done with Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.001. The model includes bidirectional LSTMs with a state size of 256, memory network with 1,000 entries, trained with Adam optimizer, dropout applied with 95.0% keep probability, dataset split into 0.8, 0.1, 0.1 ratios for training, validation, and testing. Evaluation of dialogue systems is challenging due to free-form responses, metrics like BLEU are used for performance quantification. The model employs BLEU and Entity F1 metrics to evaluate performance grounded to a knowledge base. Memory dropout improves dialogue fluency and entity recognition. Not attending to the KB leads to lower Entity F1 scores. Memory network MANN predicts responses by attending to the KB. The Seq2Seq+Attention model has the lowest Entity F1 scores, while the memory network MANN with memory dropout achieves higher scores. KVRN, which also attends to the KB, performs well without memory dropout. Our approach outperforms KVRN in Entity F1 score and slightly in BLEU score, setting a new SOTA for the dataset. Our approach outperforms KVRN by +10.4% in Entity F1 score and slightly in BLEU score, setting a new SOTA for the dataset. The correlation of keys in memory tends to become redundant as training progresses, as shown in Figure 4. The correlation between keys in memory becomes more redundant as training progresses. Different memory networks show varying degrees of linear correlations, with MANN+MD demonstrating lower correlation values due to memory dropout, leading to diverse representations in the latent space. This approach helps reduce overfitting, as evidenced by comparing Entity F1 scores for MANN and MANN+MD models. Using memory dropout encourages overwriting redundant keys, leading to diverse representations in the latent space. Comparing Entity F1 scores for MANN and MANN+MD models shows that not using memory dropout results in higher scores during training but lower scores during testing, indicating overfitting. On the other hand, using memory dropout helps reduce overfitting and improves generalization. During testing, MANN shows lower Entity F1 scores, indicating overfitting. However, using memory dropout (MANN+MD) results in better Entity F1 scores during testing, with an average improvement of 10%. Testing with different neighborhood sizes shows two distinct groups of Entity F1 scores based on the use of memory dropout. Larger memories are needed when encoding a KB with memory dropout, leading to improved Entity F1 scores during response generation. Using memory dropout in models with external memory requires larger memories to handle redundant activations. Experiments show that memory dropout allows for storing diverse keys, enabling the use of smaller memories for higher accuracy. Memory networks utilize external differentiable memory managed by a neural encoder for attention-based content retrieval. Memory networks utilize external differentiable memory managed by a neural encoder for attention-based content retrieval, extending the key-value architecture introduced in Kaiser et al. (2017) for efficient training with gradient descent and associative recall in learning sequential patterns. In this paper, the key-value architecture is extended for learning sequential patterns. Deep models are used in training dialogue agents, with recent architectures incorporating knowledge bases and external memory. However, the key-value architecture leads to overfitting, impacting response accuracy. A memory augmented model is proposed to address overfitting and reduce memory size requirements. Our model introduces a memory augmented approach to address overfitting in dialogue state trackers, reducing memory size requirements and improving response accuracy. Unlike previous works, our regularization technique focuses on memory entries rather than individual activations, providing a more effective solution. Memory Dropout is a regularization technique for memory networks that improves neural networks by breaking co-adaptating memories. It works at the level of memory entries, not individual activations, resembling areas of the human brain sensitive to semantic information. This technique addresses overfitting in dialogue state trackers and proves effective in challenging tasks like automatic dialogue response. The technique of Memory Dropout improves neural networks by regularizing the addressable keys of an external memory module, resembling areas of the human brain sensitive to semantic information. This regularization technique considers age and uncertainty to obtain higher BLEU and Entity F1 scores when training a task-oriented dialogue agent."
