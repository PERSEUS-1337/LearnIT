    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, individual homeowners with groundwater wells lack financial assistance for vital water improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for safer, cleaner, and more reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, improving existing wells, addressing water contaminants, or connecting to a local water system. Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code establishes a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program for local agencies and eligible applicants. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program, established under Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code, provides low-interest loans and grants for various purposes such as extending service lines, connecting to water systems, closing abandoned septic tanks, deepening groundwater wells, improving existing wells, and installing water treatment systems for contaminated groundwater. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is created in the State Treasury for purposes such as deepening existing groundwater wells, improving wells, and installing water treatment systems for contaminated groundwater. The fund is available for expenditure by the board upon legislative appropriation. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund receives repayments from grants and loans, including interest, and any interest earned on the fund. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median, own their residence, be unable to get financial assistance from private lenders, and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund provides loans secured by a mortgage on the residence, with a 1 percent interest rate and a 20-year repayment period. Loan recipients must maintain homeowner's insurance. The board may partner with a financial institution to offer loans and use funds for loan guarantees. Eligible grant applicants must meet specific criteria. An eligible grant applicant must have a household income below 60% of the statewide median, own the residence, and be unable to secure financial assistance from private lenders. Recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years and return any unused funds. $10 million is transferred to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund from the General Fund. An urgency statute transfers $10 million to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund to provide eligible households with access to cleaner drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. Grant recipients must repay any unused funds. Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code defines a \"water project\" as one funded by bonds from the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. The procedures outlined in subdivision (c) apply to legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or approvals for water projects. The Judicial Council must establish procedures for legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or approvals for water projects by July 1, 2016. Environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in at least 12-point type. The draft and final environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in at least 12-point type stating that certain comments filed after the public comment period may not be considered. Judicial actions challenging the certification of the report or project approval are subject to specific procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. The full text of this section must be included as an appendix in the reports. The draft and final environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice stating that certain comments filed after the public comment period may not be considered. Within 10 days of releasing the draft report, an informational workshop must be conducted, and a public hearing held within 10 days before the close of the comment period. A transcript of the hearing will be included in the final report. Within 10 days before the end of the public comment period, a public hearing must be held by the lead agency to receive testimony on the draft environmental impact report. A transcript of the hearing will be included in the final report. Within five days after the comment period closes, a commenter may request nonbinding mediation, which must be completed within 35 days. The mediation will involve the lead agency, applicant, and all commenters who requested it, focusing on resolving disputes raised in the comments. The lead agency selects mediators with expertise in land use and environmental law or science for mediation requested by commenters. Mediation sessions address areas of dispute, and agreed-upon measures become conditions of approval. Commenters agreeing to measures cannot challenge the agency's decision based on those issues. The lead agency may consider written comments submitted after the public comment period if they address new issues, new information released by the public agency, changes made to the project, or proposed conditions for approval. The lead agency must file the required notice within five days of the last initial project approval. The agency is responsible for preparing and certifying the record of proceedings, with costs to be covered by the applicant. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of its release. Any additional documents submitted after the draft report's release must also be accessible electronically within five business days. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available in an electronic format within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be provided electronically. Written comments on the project should be submitted electronically and made available to the public within five days. The lead agency must convert non-electronic comments into electronic format within seven days and make them available to the public. Comments not considered will be noted in the record without including their content. The lead agency must certify the record of proceedings within five days of filing a notice and provide an electronic copy to parties upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the court. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record of proceedings with the superior court. Any disputes over the record content will be resolved by the court, and relief will not stay construction unless there is an imminent threat to public health and safety. The court may enjoin specific activities of a water project if it poses a threat to public health or important Native American artifacts, historical, archaeological, or ecological values. An action to challenge a decision of the lead agency for a subsequent project approval is subject to specific requirements. No reimbursement is needed for this act as local agencies can raise charges to cover mandated services."
