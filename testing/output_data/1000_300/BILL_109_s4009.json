    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims the right to seek redress in Federal court and questioning the validity of regulations. It also challenges expectations set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Sandoval decision undermines protections against discrimination established by Congress under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by casting doubt on regulations and challenging settled expectations. Congress and the executive branch intended to use the regulatory process to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries of the law. The Department of Justice regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination and retaliation. These regulations, drafted by executive branch officials, have never been invalidated despite a 1966 proposal to do so. The Supreme Court has upheld these regulations. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination and retaliation. Congress considered but rejected a proposal to invalidate the regulations under Title VI. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress's failure to disapprove the regulations implies they accurately reflect congressional intent. Congress acknowledged the need for private attorneys general for effective enforcement of Title VI. The Supreme Court has affirmed individuals' right to sue for discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Federal courts, even though Congress did not explicitly grant this right in the statute. Congress and the Courts have recognized the importance of private enforcement actions for effective protection of the law. (7) Despite the Supreme Court's decision in Cort v. Ash (1975) to require explicit statutory statements for a right of action, Congress and the Courts have acknowledged an implied right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress has consistently provided means for enforcing the statutes, including establishing a right to attorney's fees in private actions. (8) The Supreme Court in Sandoval had no legal basis for denying a right of action under regulations of Title VI while permitting it under the statute, as the regulations were congressionally mandated. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated and specifically directed by Congress to effectuate antidiscrimination provisions. The regulations stress the importance of prohibiting practices that have a discriminatory effect, consistent with prohibitions of disparate treatment. The Supreme Court has acknowledged a disparate impact standard that allows courts to address unintentional discrimination. The Supreme Court has acknowledged in various decisions that evidence of a disproportionate burden can be the starting point in analyzing unlawful discrimination. An invidious purpose can often be inferred from the totality of relevant facts, including practices that disproportionately affect one race. The Supreme Court has recognized that evidence of a disproportionate burden can indicate unlawful discrimination. An invidious purpose can be inferred from the totality of relevant facts, including practices that disproportionately impact one race. The interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact that are not justified by the goals of supported programs. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact that are not justified by program goals, as reinforced by the use of this standard in enforcing Title VII. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Additionally, Congress reinstated a private right of action under Title VI to prevent unfair discrimination findings. By reinstating a private right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress ensures individuals have a remedy if denied equal access. This action is necessary to prevent unfair discrimination findings and avoid leaving equality of opportunity solely to Federal agencies. Action by Congress is necessary to specify a private right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of claims challenging discriminatory actions, highlighting the importance of maintaining a private right of action. The right to maintain a private right of action under a provision added to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will be effectuated by a waiver of sovereign immunity in the same manner as under the remaining provisions of that title. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity's policy or practice causes disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that the policy is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addresses discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must show that a covered entity's policy causes disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and if the entity fails to prove the policy is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals, or if a less discriminatory alternative exists and is refused, discrimination is established. The aggrieved person must demonstrate that each challenged policy causes a disparate impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. If a specific policy does not cause disparate impact, the entity is not required to prove it is necessary for their goals. Demonstrating a policy is necessary for program goals cannot be used as a defense. In the United States, discrimination is prohibited, and individuals cannot be retaliated against for opposing discriminatory policies or practices. Demonstrating the necessity of a policy for program goals cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the Act to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Adds a new section 602A to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, allowing aggrieved persons to bring actions against discriminatory practices. In actions under this title, an aggrieved person can seek legal relief for intentional discrimination, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. For discrimination based on disparate impact, equitable relief can be sought. In actions under this title, an aggrieved person can seek legal relief for unlawful discrimination based on disparate impact, including equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions or proceedings pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
