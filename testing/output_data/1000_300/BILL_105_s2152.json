The Act \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\" finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty. Child mortality is high in developing countries, with 33,000 children dying daily from preventable causes. Women in poverty face greater challenges and aiding them has positive effects on family well-being. Directly aiding the poorest women in the developing world has a positive effect on family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Many women in poverty lack stable employment and turn to self-employment. However, they struggle to obtain credit at reasonable rates, often resorting to high-interest money lenders. The international Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to provide access to credit for self-employment to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, particularly women. This initiative could benefit nearly half of the world's absolute poor by allowing them to expand their incomes and businesses with reasonable interest rates. The Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to provide credit for self-employment to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, benefiting nearly half of the world's absolute poor. Access to loans at reasonable interest rates can help the poor expand their incomes and businesses. NGOs like Grameen Bank and Accion International have successfully lent to the very poor, with repayment rates averaging 95 percent or higher. Microcredit institutions not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign assistance. Microcredit institutions reduce poverty and dependency on foreign assistance by leveraging interest income on credit portfolios to sustain long-term development. Loans are recycled, generating new benefits for program participants, and sustainable microcredit institutions are critical for global poverty reduction and economic development. AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative in 1994 to expand funding for these institutions. AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative in 1994 with a goal to expand funding for microenterprise programs. Funding of $137,000,000 was provided for fiscal year 1994, but by fiscal year 1996, total funding fell to $111,000,000 with only 39 percent benefiting the poorest with loans under $300. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. Providing the United States share of the global investment needed will require only a modest increase in funding for international microcredit programs, with a focus on institutions serving the poorest. To reach millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microcredit institutions. To reach millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microcredit institutions, with a focus on institutions serving the poorest. PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations have shown competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions that can reach large numbers of the very poor and help them achieve financial sustainability. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations to further support their efforts. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations to expand successful microcredit institutions and create a global infrastructure for providing financial services to the world's poorest families. AID can provide leadership in supporting microenterprise for the poorest and improve coordination efforts at the operational level.
