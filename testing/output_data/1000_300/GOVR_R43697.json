    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, with almost 5,000 deaths reported. The Ebola virus disease continues to spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, with nearly 10,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher due to weak surveillance systems in neighboring countries. Mali reported its first case, and efforts are underway to develop drugs for prevention and treatment. WHO is sending a team to Mali to assist with clinical management, contact tracing, and social mobilization for Ebola. Efforts are being made to develop drugs for prevention and treatment, including testing vaccines on health workers. Supportive care is currently used to treat EVD symptoms, and containment measures are crucial in limiting the spread of the disease. WHO has released manuals outlining appropriate patient care and diagnostic protocols to successfully contain previous Ebola outbreaks. The Ebola virus circulating in West Africa is not new, and health experts are familiar with containment methods. However, the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is spreading quickly due to inadequate health systems. Key factors distinguishing this outbreak include its emergence in West Africa and simultaneous multi-country outbreaks. The Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone has spread rapidly, with cases also reported in Senegal, Nigeria, and Mali. Efforts to contain the disease have been successful in some countries, but health workers in the United States and Spain have contracted Ebola while caring for patients. The Ebola outbreak has spread to Senegal and Mali. Health workers in the US and Spain contracted Ebola while caring for patients. The current outbreak is spreading in rural and urban areas, with challenges in isolating cases in densely populated urban areas lacking resources. Ebola is spreading rapidly in affected countries, with cases doubling every 15-20 days in Liberia. The Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in urban areas with insufficient access to clean water and health facilities. Cases are doubling every 15-20 days in Liberia and every 30-40 days in Sierra Leone. A separate outbreak in the DRC began in late July, with 66 cases and 49 deaths reported as of October 20. The Ebola outbreak in the DRC has resulted in 66 cases and 49 deaths as of October 20. Congressional actions have been accelerating to address the outbreak, with $88 million allocated for response activities and research. Congress allocated $88 million for the Ebola response in 2015, with $30 million for CDC activities in West Africa and $58 million for research and development. The Department of Defense was permitted to reprogram $750 million for building Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The health systems in affected countries were already weak and have been overwhelmed by the crisis. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have been overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system: human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. These countries face severe deficiencies in each area, exacerbating the outbreak. The spread of the virus has led to perceptions of government ineptitude, with civilians ignoring or resisting government responses. Attacks on health workers and facilities have been reported. The Ebola outbreak has led to mistrust of government responses, with attacks on health workers and facilities persisting. Some governments have used armed forces to enforce disease control measures, sparking public resentment. Concerns about the effectiveness of quarantines have been raised, leading to criticism and protests. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods in response to health expert criticisms and protests. Despite concerns, Sierra Leone officials considered a sensitization campaign successful, recovering bodies and identifying Ebola cases. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities. Delays in compensation for health workers contribute to absenteeism and worker shortages. Some health workers have abandoned their posts due to safety concerns and frustration over unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, have started providing assistance. Several local staff at Ebola treatment units in Liberia have not been paid for three months, leading to safety concerns and frustration. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources for their national Ebola response plans and need support. The United Nations estimates that Guinea needs $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the outbreak. The United Nations estimates that Guinea needs $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the Ebola outbreak. Severe shortages of health workers and clinics in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea are hindering access to medical care and treatment for those infected with Ebola. This lack of resources is also impacting broader health issues, such as maternal and child health, as clinic closures are becoming more common. Observers are concerned about inadequate access to Ebola care and the impact of clinic closures on broader health issues, especially maternal and child health. Before the outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries were among the highest globally. In 2012, a significant number of maternal and child deaths occurred in these countries due to pregnancy-related complications and lack of access to essential resources like vaccines, clean water, and nutrition. Pregnant women are reportedly avoiding health facilities, exacerbating the situation. High maternal and child mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbated by clinic closures and human resource constraints, are leading to preventable deaths. Lack of access to vaccines, clean water, and nutrition is contributing to the problem. In Liberia, more people are dying from treatable ailments than from Ebola. The shortage of health workers, with only two doctors per 100,000 people in Sierra Leone, is a significant factor in the high mortality rates. The high mortality rates in Sierra Leone and Liberia are linked to the shortage of health workers. Before the Ebola outbreak, Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors, and after the outbreak, only about 50 doctors remained. Ebola control requires labor- and resource-intensive measures, with WHO estimating that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients is needed. The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia has led to severe shortages of healthcare workers. WHO estimates that at least 250 healthcare workers are needed to treat 70 Ebola patients in a facility. The affected countries require over 13,000 health workers for care, contact tracing, and safe burials, with only 5% coming from foreign countries. The lack of health personnel has forced countries to deploy medics to the region, further diminishing healthcare options. Many health facilities in Liberia and Sierra Leone are closed, exacerbating the situation. The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia has led to severe shortages of healthcare workers, with many health facilities closed. Access to clinics was already limited before the outbreak, leaving large populations without healthcare options. Delayed health-seeking practices are reducing survival prospects among those sickened by Ebola and hindering efforts to contain the virus. The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia has caused severe shortages of healthcare workers and facilities. Delayed health-seeking practices are reducing survival prospects and hindering containment efforts. Treatment facilities are overwhelmed, leading to patients being turned away and potentially infecting others. Liberia faces the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of needed beds available. Access to treatment and healthcare could halve fatality rates according to CDC estimates. CDC estimates show fatality rates could be halved with better access to treatment and healthcare. Liberia has a severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of needed beds available. U.S. plans to build 27 ETUs in Liberia, with 12 by the Department of Defense. Health experts are investigating a decrease in Ebola care seekers. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working with community leaders to change traditional funeral practices that can spread the virus. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is contributing to Ebola cases among health workers in Liberia. CDC Director noted inconsistent availability and use of gloves and hand washing during a tour of Liberia. Interruptions in water supply in health clinics further exacerbate the poor quality of healthcare delivery. During a tour of Liberia, CDC Director Tom Frieden highlighted poor sanitation conditions in health facilities, with only one out of 29 centers having running water. Power outages, water supply interruptions, and limited ambulance services further hinder healthcare delivery. Shortages of protective gear contribute to Ebola cases among health workers. Shortages of protective gear and equipment in Sierra Leone are putting health workers at risk of contracting and spreading Ebola. Limited supplies of protective equipment are primarily provided to healthcare workers in treatment centers, leaving those who operate among the general population vulnerable. Additionally, health providers lack sufficient supplies of antibiotics and safe blood to treat Ebola cases. Shortages of protective gear and equipment in Sierra Leone are putting health workers at risk of contracting and spreading Ebola. Health providers also lack sufficient supplies of antibiotics and safe blood to treat Ebola cases. The price of disinfectants and medicine has reportedly doubled, as people attempt to protect themselves and self-medicate in light of health system deficiencies. Efforts to transport aid workers and commodities across affected countries are complicated by poor road conditions and limited air service. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but many people lack means to avoid infection due to poverty and infrastructural deficiencies. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems. Health experts are uncertain about the number of cases and their locations, particularly in areas with limited access to food. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but poverty, infrastructural deficiencies, and health system constraints still pose challenges for many people. Consumption of wild animals, including fruit bats, remains a common practice in areas with high food insecurity, despite the risks associated with eating them. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to uncertainty about the number of cases and their locations. Limited laboratory capacity results in extensive diagnosis backlogs, hindering containment efforts. International responses are accelerating, but the financial requirements for containing the outbreak are rising along with its spread. The financial requirements for containing the Ebola outbreak are increasing as the outbreak spreads. WHO estimated $4.8 million in March, but by August, it was revised to $490 million. The outbreak has caused over 3,600 cases and 1,800 deaths. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response in September. The Ebola outbreak has caused 3,685 cases and 1,841 deaths. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response to coordinate the international response. A $988 million plan has been put in place to address health and social impacts, with $493 million already contributed by donors. The UN plan for addressing the Ebola outbreak includes funding for health programs, food insecurity, economic disruptions, and supply chain networks. Donors have contributed $493 million and pledged an additional $279 million. The total committed for the outbreak is $894 million, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests as the outbreak continues. UNOCHA is expected to revise their funding requests as the Ebola outbreak spreads. The World Health Organization has outlined measures for containing the outbreak by January 2014, requesting $490 million for various initiatives. Despite increased pledges for health workers, human resource constraints are hindering containment efforts. Since September, pledges for medical support to combat the Ebola outbreak have increased, with countries like Cuba, the U.S., Britain, China, the African Union, and East African Community committing health workers. Human resource constraints continue to hinder containment efforts, leading to the development of the Community Care Campaign in Liberia to target vulnerable households. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners developed the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households with the establishment of community care centers staffed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients. Similar efforts are being made in Sierra Leone. The United States is a major funder of these initiatives. The United States is a leading funder of international Ebola response efforts, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are heavily involved in containing the outbreak in West Africa. President Obama has appointed an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global responses, with a focus on controlling the outbreak, mitigating impacts, and establishing coherent leadership and operations. President Obama appointed an Ebola Czar on October 17 to coordinate U.S. responses to the outbreak. The U.S. Global Ebola strategy aims to control the outbreak, mitigate impacts, establish leadership, and advance global health security. U.S. efforts primarily focus on Liberia, with nearly 900 government personnel stationed in the region, including 700 military personnel. These responses build on prior capacity-building efforts through USAID and CDC. Since 2005, USAID has invested roughly $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts, including responses to Ebola outbreaks. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program in 18 countries in Africa and Asia. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million on pandemic preparedness efforts through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, focusing on viral detection, risk determination, institutionalization of a \"one health\" approach, and outbreak response capacity. USAID has committed over $300 million for combating Ebola in West Africa, providing resources for treatment beds, protective equipment for healthcare staff, and outbreak response coordination. This includes a \"one health\" approach, multi-sector public health integration, and risk reduction measures to minimize new viral threats. Between March and October 2014, USAID committed over $300 million to combat Ebola in West Africa, providing treatment beds, protective equipment, hygiene kits, and support for public awareness and prevention efforts. Funds were reprogrammed from Global Health and International Disaster Assistance accounts for these initiatives. CDC funds its global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts, including the Global Disease Detection program. Appropriations for GDD have increased since 2003, with additional support requested in FY2015 to accelerate activities in response to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. In FY2015, CDC requested $45 million to support the Global Health Security Agenda, focusing on detecting, preventing, and responding to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC provides support for pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries through various partnerships and expert deployments. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 to assist in outbreak control and management, including contact tracing and data improvement. Despite initial progress, new Ebola cases resurged, prompting CDC to resume technical assistance efforts in the region. CDC is actively involved in managing EVD cases, conducting contact tracing, and improving data management in the affected countries. They have committed over $16.7 million for their Ebola responses and are providing technical assistance, training airport personnel, and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages. DOD is focused on researching treatments and vaccines, providing laboratory diagnostic assistance, and setting up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia to treat EVD cases among healthcare workers. The Department of Defense (DOD) announced a $22 million fund to set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia for treating Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases among healthcare workers. President Obama launched \"Operation United Assistance\" involving 4,000 U.S. military forces to support relief efforts, train health workers, and establish 12 facilities in Monrovia, Liberia. Operation United Assistance involves roughly 4,000 U.S. military forces overseen by DOD U.S. Africa Command. It supports relief efforts, trains health workers, and establishes 12 treatment centers in Liberia. Efforts are underway with the first 22-bed ETC expected by October's end. Funding has been approved by Congress for various related activities. Congress has approved DOD funding exceeding $1 billion for Operation United Assistance and other Ebola response activities. The outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, weakening health systems. Additional funds may be requested to contain the spread. The legislation urged expanding U.S. and international responses and provided funds for the outbreak. WHO estimated 13,000 health workers are needed to contain Ebola. Human resource constraints are most acute in Liberia. The U.S. has partnered with Liberia, WHO, and other groups for a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concern about the Campaign. The United States has partnered with Liberia, WHO, and other groups for a Community Care Campaign to address Ebola. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the Campaign potentially becoming \"contamination centers\" without proper infection control and supplies. WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the CCC if implementation lacks quality control. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols is contributing to EVD cases among health workers. Key factors complicating safe implementation of the Community Care Campaign include quality control and adherence to infection control protocols. Concerns arise regarding trained health personnel, non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members following IPC protocols, especially for lay personnel providing Ebola care in CCCs. WHO recommends only one family member provide care for each patient in CCCs to prevent EVD spread to the community. The WHO recommends that only one family member provide care for each patient in Community Care Campaigns (CCCs) to prevent the spread of Ebola. However, challenges such as collective familial care practices, loss of income, and emotional stress may hinder compliance with this guideline. In addition, adherence to infection control protocols, including wearing personal protective equipment and safe burial practices, is crucial to prevent the spread of Ebola within CCCs. The WHO recommends strict adherence to infection control protocols, including wearing personal protective equipment and safe burial practices in Community Care Campaigns (CCCs) to prevent the spread of Ebola. Challenges exist in ensuring compliance with these guidelines, especially among lay caregivers without medical training and access to sanitation facilities. Monitoring and supervision are crucial for the success of these protocols. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with infection control protocols, including proper use of PPE. Poor supply chain management leads to interruptions in medical supplies at health clinics, affecting availability of essential protective equipment like gloves and masks. Due to poor supply chain management, health clinics in affected countries lack essential protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, leading to EVD infection among health workers. WHO advises a gradual approach to ensuring continuous supply of commodities to CCCs. USAID is already implementing the Community Care Campaign by issuing grants to NGOs. The U.S. is implementing the Community Care Campaign by issuing grants to NGOs for managing Community Care Centers in affected countries. USAID has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia. Questions arise about U.S. oversight and implementation, particularly regarding quality control and IPC protocol standardization. WHO leadership in the global Ebola response has faced criticism. Observers have criticized WHO leadership over the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced effectiveness and capacity to contain outbreaks. Some critics also point to bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff as hindering WHO's response efforts. Some critics argue that WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak has been hindered by budget cuts, bureaucratic bloat, and underqualified staff. Debates have arisen on whether WHO should focus on advisory roles or maintain operational capacity, with suggestions for a Health Systems Fund to address both long-term health system capacity and short-term crises like Ebola. There are differing opinions on the feasibility of WHO leading emergency health response efforts due to political sovereignty concerns. Some argue for a ready-to-deploy team of emergency health responders to address crises like the Ebola outbreak, but concerns about WHO's ability to lead due to political sovereignty issues exist. Weak health systems in West Africa contribute to the rapid spread of Ebola. Donors have struggled with how to address health emergencies, with debates on disease-based funding and its impact on public health systems. Disease-specific programs are criticized for exacerbating human resource shortages and weakening health systems, while supporters believe they strengthen oversight capacity. The debate over disease-based funding intensified with the introduction of PEPFAR, which provided funding outside of government networks to save lives and prevent HIV infections. The United States became the primary supporter, raising concerns about sustainability if funding were to be discontinued. In the second phase of PEPFAR, resources were used to support health systems to strengthen country capacity for HIV/AIDS programs. Currently, there is a debate on the use of PEPFAR funds for health system building. A 2013 GAO report highlighted that 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. Health system advocates are concerned about budgetary reforms to comply with the law. Deborah Birx, PEPFAR Country Coordinator, aims to allocate 50% of resources to care and treatment activities. Budgetary reforms may hinder efforts to strengthen health systems. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the Ebola outbreak, needing focused support for containment. However, without support for health system development, countries may struggle to detect and respond to future outbreaks. Ken Isaacs highlighted this issue at a 2014 congressional hearing on Ebola. Ken Isaacs, VP of International Programs at Samaritan's Purse, emphasized the need to prioritize emergency response over health system development during deadly disease outbreaks like Ebola. USAID has formed a working group to strengthen health systems post-outbreak, but funding mainly targets specific diseases rather than overall health system improvement. Despite calls for increased investment in health systems, current health programs lack specific appropriations for this purpose. Most health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving limited resources for overall health system strengthening. The ongoing Ebola outbreak is being addressed by various U.S. agencies, with the Department of State leading diplomatic efforts, USAID coordinating responses, CDC managing public health activities, and DOD providing support to foreign armed forces. The budgetary structure of these agencies allows them to respond effectively to unforeseen health events. The CDC is leading public health and medical response activities, while the DOD is providing support for foreign armed forces. The budgetary structure of these agencies allows them to respond effectively to unforeseen health events. The Department of State coordinates diplomatic engagements through existing channels and does not require additional funding. Congress has established numerous measures to support outbreak responses by the CDC and DOD. The DOD budget supports various domestic and international health activities without detailed congressional direction. USAID often receives specific directives from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unforeseen events like the Ebola outbreak without reallocating funds from ongoing health efforts. Currently, USAID is reprogramming funds from preventing future outbreaks to address the Ebola outbreak and other ongoing health crises. Currently, USAID is reprogramming funds from preventing future outbreaks to address the Ebola outbreak and other ongoing health crises, including responses to H7N9 avian influenza in China and MERS-CoV in the Middle East. Supporters view this appropriation structure as a tool for overseeing health programs, while opponents argue it limits agility in the field. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with proper surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be minimized. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South, and Southeast Asia. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is lower than the previous year. Experts predict the Ebola outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing long-term effects in the region. USAID official believes current funding levels are insufficient to meet demands. The Ebola outbreak is causing high death tolls and disrupting social structures in West and Central Africa. MSF reports that affected villages in Sierra Leone have lost many adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns are growing about the increasing number of orphaned children, who are particularly vulnerable to marginalization. This adds to the existing large orphan populations in the region due to various causes like armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. In 2012, West and Central Africa had a large orphan population, with over 4 million children losing a parent to AIDS. The Ebola outbreak is further straining the region's healthcare system, potentially leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates. The full health impact of Ebola remains unknown, but it is diverting resources and causing a shortage of health personnel. This may reignite debates on how U.S. global health assistance funds are allocated. The Ebola outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa has raised concerns about broader health and development needs, sparking debates on the allocation of U.S. global health assistance funds. Despite multiple outbreaks since 1976, there is still no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine for Ebola. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested, but the full health effects of the outbreak remain unknown. Advocates are pushing for support in addressing issues such as maternal and child mortality, child vulnerability, poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections exacerbated by the Ebola crisis. There is no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine for Ebola. Treatment of symptoms increases survival chances. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials. Debate surrounds the ethical use of experimental drugs, especially regarding equity between U.S. and African patients. The ethical concern of administering untested experimental drugs to African patients during the Ebola outbreak was discussed by WHO. They announced that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions under certain conditions. WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. Limited use of experimental treatment might be available in Liberia by early November. WHO planned to begin testing two Ebola vaccines in January on 20,000 health workers and volunteers, with the possibility of limited use of experimental treatment in Liberia by early November. Discussions were held to fast track testing and deployment of vaccines to impact the Ebola epidemic, with concerns about ethical practices arising during the trials. Bordering countries were warned of the risk of Ebola cases, with Mali reporting its first case on October 23, 2014. WHO warned bordering countries of the risk of Ebola cases, with Mali reporting its first case on October 23, 2014. An Oxford University study raised concerns about future Ebola outbreaks in Central and West Africa due to the presence of fruit bats in forested areas. WHO is assisting neighboring countries in building EVD surveillance and response plans. Changes in human mobility could impact the dispersion of Ebola cases in urban areas and sub-Saharan Africa. Future Ebola outbreaks may occur in sub-Saharan Africa, with changes in human mobility impacting the dispersion of cases. Questions arise about the effectiveness of the U.S. response, support for pandemic preparedness, funding allocation, and the impact on global health programs. Efforts are being made to improve the capacity of affected countries and the region to detect and respond to future outbreaks."
