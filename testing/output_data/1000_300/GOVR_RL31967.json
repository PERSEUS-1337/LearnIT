    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and government accounts, including trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by the government's surpluses or deficits. Debt held in government accounts is influenced by net financial flows and government accounting practices. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has increased borrowing from the public every year except in FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. The accumulation of Social Security and other trust funds has led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit, requiring Congress to periodically raise the debt limit. The Greenspan Commission's recommendations led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit, requiring Congress to periodically raise the debt limit. Standard methods of financing federal activities can be hindered when debt nears its legal limit, impacting government trust fund accounts. The ability to borrow is crucial for Treasury cash management systems to handle fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. If the U.S. Treasury is unable to borrow due to a debt limit, it may struggle to meet all legal obligations in a timely manner. If federal outlays exceed revenues, the government may struggle to meet legal obligations on time due to the debt limit preventing new debt issuance. This could hinder the Treasury's ability to borrow on favorable terms in the future, as delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow on advantageous terms could be hindered by sustained inability to pay obligations on time. Delays in debt limit increases may lead to serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Default on interest payments could have severe repercussions globally, but it could be avoided by delaying other federal payments. This delay effectively borrows from various entities, incurring interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act. The U.S. Treasury may face consequences if it cannot fund federal obligations, leading to interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act. Credit agencies and economists warn of risks to the financial system if Treasury defaults on payments. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt during debt ceiling constraints. If the market links Treasury securities with default risks, global capital markets could be significantly affected. Past Treasury Secretaries used special strategies during debt ceiling constraints, such as suspending debt sales and withholding certain receipts. The Treasury Secretary can invoke a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to use these strategies with certain government trust funds. U.S. Treasury responses to the 2007 credit crunch created balance sheet items that expanded options for the Treasury Secretary. The U.S. Treasury began selling off mortgage-backed securities acquired in late 2008 at a pace of $10 billion per month to minimize market disruptions. As of March 2012, the Treasury portfolio of MBSs has been eliminated. However, proceeds from potential asset sales are unlikely to sustain debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities acquired in late 2008 to minimize market disruptions. However, other potential asset sales are unlikely to sustain debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. Some have suggested using the Fourteenth Amendment to ignore the debt limit, but President Obama and legal analysts reject this idea. Innovative strategies to avoid debt ceiling constraints have been proposed. More imaginative strategies have been proposed to avoid debt ceiling constraints. The debt limit can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage the federal government's finances, leading to extraordinary measures to meet obligations. While it has not caused default, it has caused inconvenience and uncertainty. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability, requiring visible action when spending exceeds revenues. The debt limit imposes fiscal accountability on Congress and the President, requiring visible action when spending exceeds revenues. Some experts argue for eliminating the debt limit, stating that other controls in the budget process are more effective. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval, providing individual Members with a separate instrument to influence federal fiscal policy. Congress delegates work to its committees, with Committees on Appropriations handling discretionary spending, authorizing committees responsible for mandatory program spending decisions, and Committees on the Budget drafting an overall budgetary framework. Measures involving the debt limit offer a different leverage for controlling federal spending. Congress has historically placed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers of the purse, taxation, and war initiation. Before World War I, borrowing was authorized for specific purposes, with Congress specifying financial instruments, interest rates, maturities, and redemption details. Before World War I, Congress authorized borrowing for specific purposes like the Panama Canal, specifying financial instruments, interest rates, maturities, and redemption details. Concerns were raised about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies, but these became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management, alongside long-term bonds. After the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management, as well as long-term bonds. The act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to have $100 million outstanding in short-term certificates of indebtedness, mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. Additionally, $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds were made available to public subscription, allowing smaller investors to participate. Proponents of the act emphasized giving the Treasury Secretary substantial administrative leeway within set limits. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 expanded the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway by dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. It incorporated unused borrowing capacity from previous acts and retained separate limits for previous debt issues. Subsequent borrowing measures were drafted as amendments to the Second Liberty Bond Act. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 expanded the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway by dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. Subsequent borrowing measures were drafted as amendments to the Second Liberty Bond Act until 1982. In the 1920s, Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with additional leeway to replace expensive older federal debt with cheaper new issues, introducing notes and savings certificates for small investors. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing for more efficient management of public debt. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of having complete freedom in determining the type of securities to be issued. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also called for increased flexibility in financial management. In 1935, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau called for replacing a limit on bond issuance with a more flexible limit on the amount of outstanding bonds, emphasizing Treasury bonds' role in managing federal finances. Congress established limits on shorter-term debt and outstanding bonds. In 1939, President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt, leading to the approval of the measure (H.R. 5748) by the House and Senate. The House approved measure H.R. 5748 on March 23, 1939, and the Senate passed an amended version on June 1. On July 20, law P.L. 76-201 created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt, allowing the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively. The Treasury was given more flexibility to manage federal debt by issuing longer-term bonds, reducing interest costs and financial risks. In 1941, the borrowing authority for \"National Defense\" series securities was folded back under an increased aggregate limit of $65 billion. The debt limit in 1939 was $45 billion, only 10% above the total federal debt at that time. After World War I, the federal debt limit was raised to $43 billion in 1919. During World War II, the debt ceiling was increased annually, reaching $300 billion in 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion, remaining unchanged until 1954 due to financing the Korean War through pay-as-you-go methods. Temporary increases were approved in 1954 and 1957, but the limit reverted back to $275 billion. In 1954, the Eisenhower Administration requested a debt limit increase, which was initially declined by Congress. Temporary increases followed, but the limit reverted to $275 billion in 1957. Congress raised the limit in February 1958 to promote better financial management. By March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion, its post-World War II level. Since then, there have been 78 measures altering the federal debt limit, with recent increases like the $1.9 trillion raise in February 2010. Since FY1996, federal debt has seen changes with surpluses in FY1998-FY2001, followed by deficits leading to growth in debt held by the public and intergovernmental accounts. Recent increases in the debt limit, like the $1.9 trillion raise in February 2010, have been significant. Components of debt are shown in current dollars and as percentages of GDP, with projections through FY2019. Federal debt components in current dollars and as percentages of GDP have been tracked since FY1996. Debt held by government accounts has grown steadily since 1982, partly due to Social Security tax increases. Debt held by the public increased as a share of GDP until the mid-1990s, then decreased during surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001. Subsequent deficits led to a rise in debt as a percentage of GDP. The federal government ran surpluses from FY1998 through FY2001, reducing debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP. However, deficits reemerged in FY2002, leading to an increase in debt held by the public and pressure on the debt limit. During the four fiscal years with surpluses, there was a net increase of $405 billion in total debt subject to limit. The federal government saw surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing debt held by the public. However, deficits returned in FY2002, increasing debt and pressuring the debt limit. A $405 billion net increase in total debt subject to limit occurred during the surplus years. In FY2002, debt subject to limit neared the $5,950 billion limit, prompting a request to raise the limit to $6,700 billion. In early December 2001, the Administration asked Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion as the debt approached the limit. By April 15, 2002, debt subject to limit stood at $5,949,975 million, just $25 million below the limit. The Treasury avoided reaching the limit by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. On April 15, debt subject to limit was $5,949,975 million, just $25 million below the limit. The Treasury \"made whole\" the G-Fund by restoring all debt not issued to the TSP and credited interest. By the end of April, debt fell $35 billion below the limit. In May 2002, debt rose within $15 million of the limit. Treasury used statutory authority to avoid default twice in 2002. Treasury asked Congress to raise the debt limit or make changes for new debt issuance. The Treasury faced financing problems without a debt limit increase and requested Congress to raise the limit or make statutory changes. They took extraordinary actions to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, including suspending investments in trust funds and issuing new debt. These actions were expected to last until June 28, 2002. The Treasury took extraordinary actions to avoid breaching the debt ceiling, including suspending investments in trust funds and issuing new debt instruments. These measures were expected to last until June 28, 2002, but without a debt limit increase by that date, the Treasury would need to take further actions to prevent default. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit through the FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill. The government was on the verge of default in May and June 2002. Congress passed a bill to increase the debt limit, with the Senate eventually raising it by $450 billion to $6,400 billion to avoid default. The House passed a $450 billion debt limit increase by a single vote on June 27, 2002, to avoid default. The President signed the bill into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. Kenneth Dam, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit by late February 2003 as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the debt limit to avoid financial problems. The Treasury requested a debt limit increase as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests to avoid financial problems. Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the limit, allowing additional debt issuance to acquire cash needed for government commitments. The Treasury requested a debt limit increase as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests to avoid financial problems. Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the limit, allowing additional debt issuance to acquire cash needed for government commitments. Through February to May, the debt subject to limit was managed below the ceiling. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The Senate acted on the debt-limit legislation in May after Treasury warnings of default, eventually passing it to the President for signing. In May 2003, the Senate passed legislation to raise the debt limit to $7,384 billion after Treasury warnings of default. By October 2004, debt subject to limit reached $7,383,975 million, just $25 million below the existing limit. The Treasury used methods to keep debt under the legal limit. The Treasury warned that the debt limit would be reached in October, with debt just $25 million below the existing limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's reputation in capital markets. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no resolution to raise the debt limit could be deemed passed by the House. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no resolution to raise the debt limit could be deemed passed by the House automatically under the Gephardt rule. As the debt approached the limit through the summer and into the fall, no legislation was moved to raise the debt limit. In September 2004, an amendment was added to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations in an effort to remove the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached and reached the existing limit. The legislation cleared the House, but the Senate did not act on it. In November 2004, Senator Frist introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House. The President signed the legislation into law, anticipating the new limit would be reached between August and December 2005. Treasury delayed a debt auction and invoked a \"debt limit suspension period\" before the increase in the debt limit. In 2005, the debt limit increase allowed the Treasury to reschedule a debt auction and cancel a \"debt limit suspension period.\" Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion. In 2005, Congress instructed committees to report bills raising the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. The House passed a resolution automatically raising the debt limit, but the Senate had not considered it by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. At the end of the first session of the 109th Congress, the Senate had not considered H.J.Res. 47 or a reconciliation bill raising the debt limit. Secretary of the Treasury Snow warned Congress in December 2005 that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006, requesting an increase. Despite taking measures to avoid reaching the limit, the Treasury's actions would only suffice until mid-March 2006. In March 2006, Secretary Snow authorized actions to address the government's inability to meet its obligations. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, raising it to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit to $9,815 billion. The conference report on the budget resolution led to the automatic engrossment of a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 43, 110th Congress) raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit in July 2007, projecting it would be reached in early October. The CBO Director later estimated it would be reached in late October or early November. The Senate approved the resolution without changes on September 12, 2007, and it was signed by the President on September 29, 2007. Financial markets showed signs of turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious crisis in 2008. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 43 on September 27, 2007, which was signed by the President on September 29, 2007 (P.L. 110-91). The financial crisis and recession in 2008 led to federal actions to stabilize markets, unfreeze credit, boost consumption, and increase spending. This resulted in large deficits and a series of debt limit increases. The recession in 2008 led to federal actions to stabilize markets, unfreeze credit, boost consumption, and increase spending, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. Falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, while job cuts and unemployment led to lower individual income taxes. The recession in 2008 led to federal actions to stabilize markets, unfreeze credit, boost consumption, and increase spending, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. Falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, while job cuts and unemployment led to lower individual income taxes. Deficit spending can provide a fiscal stimulus if output levels are below potential, but it can also accelerate inflation if output levels are near or at potential levels, exacerbating long-term fiscal challenges. In March 2008, CBO estimated a $396 billion deficit in FY2008 and a $342 billion deficit in FY2009, with the actual deficit for FY2008 reaching $455 billion. The federal government took actions to stabilize markets and boost consumption during the 2008 recession, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. The CBO estimated deficits of $396 billion in FY2008 and $342 billion in FY2009, but the actual deficit for FY2008 was $455 billion. By August 2009, the deficit was projected to reach $1,587 billion in FY2009 and $1,381 billion in FY2010. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions recommended policies that would result in a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion in FY2009, respectively, necessitating an increase in the federal debt limit. The Senate and House passed resolutions recommending policies that would result in a total debt of $10,278 billion in FY2009, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The House passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take it up, so the limit remained at $9,815 billion. The House passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, which was later approved by the Senate and signed into law by the President on July 30, 2008. The bill also included provisions for extending a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, as well as creating the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created to replace the Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship on September 7, 2008. On September 7, 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control over their assets. The federal government took steps to stabilize financial markets, including a proposal to buy mortgage-related assets and raise the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Representative Barney Frank proposed an amendment to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The Treasury proposed increasing its holdings of mortgage-related securities to $700 billion and raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Representative Barney Frank's amendment to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which included raising the debt limit, was rejected by the House. The Senate passed a different version of the Act (H.R. 1424) on October 1, 2008, raising the debt limit. This was signed into law on the same day, increasing the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Congress considered a new economic stimulus measure with tax cuts and spending increases to address current economic conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009, raising the debt limit to $12,104 billion. This measure contained tax cuts and spending increases to address current economic conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, signed into law on February 17, 2009, raised the debt limit to $12,104 billion. A House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) in April 2009 proposed raising the limit to $13,029 billion, triggering the Gephardt rule. In August 2009, Treasury Secretary Geithner warned Congress of reaching the debt limit in mid-October. The U.S. Treasury later postponed the limit until December by reducing loans through the Supplemental Financing Program. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Following Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, the Obama Administration considered reducing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lower federal debt subject to the statutory limit. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also decrease the debt amount subject to the limit. Other measures, like those taken in 2003 during a \"debt issuance suspension period,\" could extend the U.S. Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. Additionally, the Treasury was set to issue nonmarketable securities to the FDIC and make interest payments to federal trust funds, which could have posed challenges without a debt limit increase. The House passed H.R. 4314 to raise the debt limit to $12,394 billion on December 16, 2009, followed by the Senate on December 24 and signed by the President on December 28. The Senate later passed an amended version of H.J.Res. 45 on January 28. The debt limit was raised to $12,394 billion on December 15, 2009, and passed by the House and Senate. An amended version raised it to $14,294 billion on January 28. A national commission to address federal debt was proposed but not approved. The debt limit was increased to $14,294 billion on January 28, 2010, after an amendment failed to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action.\" President Obama then appointed a Fiscal Commission to address fiscal sustainability, which issued a report on December 1, 2010. The House approved the measure on February 4, and it was signed into law by the President on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was more contentious than previous ones. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed by the President on February 12, 2010. U.S. Treasury Secretary announced a debt issuance suspension period until August 2, 2011, when borrowing authority would be exhausted. The U.S. Treasury extended its borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011, due to the projected federal deficit of $1,399 billion. Extraordinary measures may provide limited time before the government cannot meet financial obligations. Some suggested cutting spending to avoid increasing the debt limit, but the scale of required reductions would be significant. The U.S. Treasury extended borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011, due to a projected federal deficit of $1,399 billion. Cutting spending to avoid increasing the debt limit was suggested, but the scale of required reductions would be significant. On July 15, the Treasury announced suspending reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, one of the last available extraordinary measures before borrowing authority would be exhausted on August 2. Funding federal operations could become complicated without a debt limit increase. The U.S. Treasury's cash management is becoming more challenging without a debt limit increase. An analysis projects a cash shortfall of $134.3 billion from August 3 to the end of the month. Uncertainties surround Treasury's estimates on when the debt limit will bind and how long extraordinary measures will last. Higher tax revenues and MBS sales have temporarily increased the federal debt headroom. In late April, higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities expanded federal debt headroom. Estimates on reaching the debt limit and extending borrowing capacity through extraordinary measures closely align with Treasury's projections. Treasury Secretary planned to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted, allowing measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. In a letter to Congress dated May 2, 2011, Treasury Secretary Geithner indicated plans to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand. Extraordinary measures were in place to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until early August 2011, including the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) and suspension of new issues of State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Treasury securities. Geithner had previously requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, stating that federal debt would likely reach its statutory limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. On May 6, 2011, Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit, stating that federal debt would reach its limit between March and May 2011. Despite efforts, a bill to raise the debt limit was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, but was later tabled by the Senate on July 22. The House passed the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 on July 19, 2011, but the Senate tabled the bill on July 22. A revised compromise measure, the Budget Control Act of 2011, was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, eliminating the need for further increases in the debt limit until early 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) was signed into law, eliminating the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. It included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and a mechanism for raising the debt ceiling. The Budget Control Act of 2011 eliminated the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. It included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and a mechanism for raising the debt ceiling. The legislation provided a three-step procedure for increasing the debt limit, with the first increase of $400 billion on August 2, 2011, and a second increase of $500 billion on September 22, 2011. The second increase was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, making it challenging to block a debt limit increase. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, triggering a provision for a third increase of $1.2 trillion. The President delayed the request to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. The third increase could also have been triggered in two other ways. The debt limit increase of $1.2 trillion was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, which the President delayed to allow Congress to consider. Two other ways to trigger the increase included a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee. The debt limit increase of $1.2 trillion was tied to budget reductions through sequestration. The Super Committee failed to agree on recommendations, leading to this increase. Treasury Secretary Geithner used extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations until the end of 2012. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43389. The debt limit was temporarily suspended until May 19, 2013, allowing the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used for federal payments. After the suspension lapsed, the debt limit was reset to $16,699 billion, $305 billion higher than the previous limit. After the debt limit suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit to $16,699 billion, $305 billion higher than before. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period and sent updates to Congress on the borrowing capacity, which was extended due to increased revenue and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After updating Congress on the borrowing capacity, Secretary Lew stated that the U.S. Treasury expected to exhaust its borrowing capacity no later than October 17, 2013. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, suspending the debt limit until February 8, 2014. The debt limit was then reset to $17,212 billion on February 7, 2014. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. Treasury Secretary Lew then implemented extraordinary measures to manage the debt limit until July 30, 2015. The debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion, and Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to manage it until July 30, 2015. He later extended these measures until the end of October, with a small cash reserve projected to be on hand. Secretary Lew stated that the extraordinary measures would be exhausted no later than November 3, 2015. Secretary Lew stated that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected. Independent analysts initially projected the measures to last until November or early December 2015, but recent estimates in September 2015 pushed that date closer to mid-November 2015. The \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues, including the debt limit reset to March 16, 2017. On October 26, 2015, a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" was released, addressing fiscal issues including the debt limit reset to March 16, 2017. The agreement also increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The House concurred with Senate amendments on October 28, 2015, leading to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was approved by the Senate and signed into law by the President on November 2, 2015. The federal government's budget surpluses in the late 1990s turned into deficits due to increased military and security spending after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The federal government's budget surpluses in the late 1990s turned into deficits due to increased military and security spending after the September 11, 2001 attacks, leading to a series of debt limit increases. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent economic recession further accelerated the growth of total debt, necessitating additional debt limit increases. The fiscal costs of a financial crisis, such as bailing out financial institutions, are overshadowed by the impact of reduced tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. Despite a decrease in federal deficits since 2011, without significant policy changes, persistent deficits could lead to a substantial increase in federal debt over the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the current trajectory of federal borrowing is unsustainable and could hinder long-term economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office has been warning for years about the unsustainable trajectory of federal borrowing, which could lead to slower economic growth in the long run. Without policy changes, Congress would need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing federal debt. Data on federal debt since September 2001 shows monthly balances subject to the debt limit. Since September 2001, federal debt has been increasing steadily, with total federal debt rising by $12,380 billion by September 2015. Debt held by government accounts increased by $2,566 billion, and debt held by the public increased by $9,813 billion during this period. Despite occasional reductions, all three measures of debt subject to limit have shown an overall increasing trend."
