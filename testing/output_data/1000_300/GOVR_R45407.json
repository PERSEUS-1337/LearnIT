    "content": "Decades of federal policymaking emphasize the importance of quality instruction for student learning. The Higher Education Act of 1965 includes provisions in Title II, Part A to improve teacher preparation programs through financial support and accountability measures. This includes a competitive grant program for program reforms and reporting requirements for states to track and report on teacher preparation program quality. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA), with one bill proposing to repeal all provisions in Title II and another bill seeking to amend and extend Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 and was extended for an additional fiscal year. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 and was extended for an additional fiscal year under the General Education Provisions Act. Title II-A authorities have continued to be funded under various appropriations legislation, most recently under P.L. 115-245 for FY2019. Congressional action to reauthorize the HEA may continue, with key issues identified for debate. The report discusses current programs and provisions in Title II-A in the context of teacher preparation in the United States. The report discusses the historical context of teacher preparation in the United States, focusing on traditional programs at institutions of higher education. The rise of alternative approaches to teacher preparation has posed challenges to federal policy on program quality accountability. Most teachers in the US have been prepared at higher education institutions since the early 20th century. In the early 20th century, most U.S. teachers were trained at programs by higher education institutions, replacing normal schools. Schools of education emphasized pedagogy over subject-area knowledge, leading to a split in teacher preparation. In recent years, the divide between subject-area knowledge and teaching practice has widened due to alternative routes to teacher certification focusing on classroom instruction and management. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 require an annual report on teacher preparation in the U.S., with the Secretary's Tenth Annual Report being the most recent. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report, mandated by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation in the U.S. Data for the 2015-2016 academic year show that 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers based at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 26,589 teacher preparation programs with 70% being traditional, 20% alternative route at IHEs, and 10% alternative route not at IHEs. Among 499,800 teacher candidates, 89% were in traditional programs, 5% in alternative route at IHEs, and 6% in alternative route not at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of the 192,849 program completers, with Texas leading at 11%. In the 2012-2013 academic year, five states, including Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, prepared 35% of teacher preparation program completers. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route completions. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights aspects of teacher preparation in the United States, such as the required hours of supervised clinical experience and student teaching in traditional programs. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. Traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not have such requirements. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers each. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. Traditional programs have 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not have such requirements. The most common subject area of program completion is elementary education, followed by special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score was 14 percentage points above the average cut score. Over 95% of candidates who took a state assessment passed the test. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting and accountability provisions. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program, the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, which aims to improve teacher preparation and support professional development activities for new teachers. The TQP program funds traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to improve teacher preparation and support professional development for new teachers through traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year programs and teacher residency programs. The program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to around two dozen partnerships. Approximately 30% of awarded projects are pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, 48% are residency programs, and 23% are a combination of both. Awards have been given to various teacher preparation programs in different fiscal years, with eligibility criteria for partnerships to receive TQP awards. Four teacher preparation programs received TQP grants in FY2016, with grants also awarded in FY2014, FY2010, and FY2009. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, and coordination with other federally funded programs. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs like Teacher Quality State Grants and Teacher Incentive Fund. Grants support reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, clinical education, mentoring, and induction programs. The curr_chunk discusses various initiatives to improve teacher preparation and support, including developing high-quality clinical education programs, induction programs, professional development, recruitment mechanisms, and literacy instruction skills. Grants are provided for teacher residency programs to prepare teachers for success in high-need schools. Grants are provided for teacher residency programs to develop and implement rigorous graduate-level coursework for prospective teachers. Programs include guided teaching apprenticeships with mentor teachers, criteria for selecting effective mentors, and placement in targeted schools for professional collaboration. Cohort members receive a living stipend or salary and must commit to teaching full time in high-need schools for at least three years. Grants are provided for school leadership programs to prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, and other school leaders. Cohort members receive a one-year living stipend or salary and must commit to teaching full time in high-need schools for at least three years. Programs focus on developing strong leadership skills, promoting professional development for teachers, using data to drive instruction and learning, managing resources effectively, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and understanding teaching and assessment skills. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for teacher preparation programs under the TQP program, including developing teaching and assessment skills, using data for evaluation, managing resources effectively, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and understanding student learning. It also mentions the need for a yearlong clinical education program, mentoring and induction programs, and recruiting qualified individuals for school leadership. Additionally, Title II of the HEA holds teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and IHEs to report program performance to receive funds. Title II of the HEA requires states and IHEs to report on the performance of teacher preparation programs to receive funds. States issue report cards to ED and the public, while IHEs issue report cards to the state and the public. The information is used to evaluate teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States. Section 207 of the HEA further mandates states to establish criteria for evaluating programs and report results for traditional and alternative route programs. In 2014, states were required to evaluate teacher preparation programs based on criteria such as teaching skill and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Other criteria included improving student achievement, raising entry standards, and increasing professional development opportunities. 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk programs. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs. On February 8, 2018, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported the H.R. 4508, which aims to improve the teaching profession and increase professional development opportunities.

On February 8, 2018, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported the H.R. 4508, which aims to improve the teaching profession and increase professional development opportunities. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced on July 26, 2018, as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program and expansion of accountability provisions for institutions. The HEA reauthorization bill includes provisions for second grants for teachers and principals, expanded accountability for institutions and states, and requirements for report cards. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations in March 2017. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including provisions in Title II, addressing federal support for teacher preparation programs and accountability measures. The reauthorization of the HEA, including Title II provisions, may involve considering the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, the mix of TQP activities, and the effectiveness of current accountability measures. Some argue for an expanded federal role to support quality programs, while others believe teacher training should remain a state and local responsibility. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe teacher training should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities supported under the TQP program, with traditional routes to teaching seeking support for enhancements like supervised clinical practice and assessments, and alternative routes wanting fewer restrictions on TQP partners. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe teacher training should remain a state and local responsibility. Advocates of alternative routes want fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. There are calls for increased accountability in teacher preparation programs, with suggestions for program evaluations tied to student performance outcomes. Some argue for increased accountability in teacher preparation programs, with calls for program evaluations based on outcome measures tied to student performance. However, others believe such requirements should not be mandated at the federal level, as current reporting already burdens state and local administrators."
