    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected sea otters, but further expansion into the designated management zone may pose national security risks. The expansion of the southern sea otter population into the designated management zone may have national security impacts. Military training programs need flexibility to adapt to real-world events. Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address the needs of threatened species and provide conservation benefits. Public Law 99-625 grants authority for these actions. Public Law 99-625 grants authority for the designation of otters at San Nicolas Island as a nonessential experimental population to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter while allowing for military readiness activities. The establishment of Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, is authorized to ensure conservation of the southern sea otter population while accommodating military activities. Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are designated for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island. The areas are specified by coordinates and boundaries to ensure the conservation of the southern sea otter population while accommodating military activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, including Clemente Island and adjacent waters, are designated for national defense purposes. The areas are specified by coordinates to ensure conservation of the southern sea otter population while accommodating military activities. In the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities are exempt from the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas allow for the incidental taking of southern sea otters during military activities. Sea otters in these areas are treated as proposed endangered species and are not required to be removed. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas do not require the removal of sea otters present there. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or end exceptions if military activities hinder sea otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy must monitor these areas every three years to track sea otter population changes. The Secretary of the Navy is required to monitor the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track the population changes. Reports must be submitted to Congress and the public on the monitoring activities. This section does not override any other federal laws, and an ecosystem management plan must be developed in accordance with existing regulations. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, with the Marine Mammal Commission, will develop an ecosystem management plan for California waters. The plan aims to recover the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone, while maintaining shellfish fisheries at current levels. The Fish and Wildlife Service will assess carrying capacity within a year. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of the habitat for southern sea otters, including the impacts of water quality and causes of degradation. The existing relocation and management plan for southern sea otters will continue until the required management plan and assessment are completed. The existing relocation and management plan for southern sea otters will continue until the required management plan and assessment are completed. Definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided in this section. The term 'southern sea otter' refers to a member of the subspecies Enhydra lutris nereis. 'Take' has specific meanings under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 and includes training and operations related to combat and testing of military equipment for combat use.
