    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detection Canine Augmentation Act of 2005\". The Congress recognizes the importance of detection canines in homeland security for detecting explosives, narcotics, concealed humans, and cadavers in various locations where detection technologies are not feasible. There is a shortage of detection canines available to support law enforcement at all levels. Detection canines are in short supply for law enforcement, despite Congress authorizing more Border Patrol agents. Canines are needed in airports and mass transit systems. Urban search and rescue canines were effective in the Gulf Coast region. Detection canines are utilized by various agencies like the Bureau of United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Protective Service for security purposes. Urban search and rescue canines were effective during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing regarding the use of detection canines in support of homeland security. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing on September 28, 2005, about the shortage of trained detection canines for homeland security activities. Members were informed by various agencies and organizations about the lack of trained canines. Increasing the number of trained detection canines is a priority for homeland security activities. In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines by 25 percent at ports of entry, airports, mass transit systems, Coast Guard stations, Secret Service operations, and Federal Protective Service. Increase by at least 25 percent the number of trained detection canine teams for Coast Guard stations, Secret Service operations, Federal Protective Service, and Federal Emergency Management Agency to enhance their availability during emergencies. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing training facilities efficiently, and explore partnerships with other organizations to increase the availability of trained detection canines for law enforcement agencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security must report to Congress within 120 days on plans to coordinate and consolidate canine training programs, including increasing coordination with other federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to prioritize increasing the use of domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism purposes, consult with other federal agencies to encourage domestic breeding, and consolidate canine procurement to reduce costs."
