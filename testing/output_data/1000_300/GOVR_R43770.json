    "content": "The hidden feature of federal crimes is that helpers and offenders face the same punishment under 18 U.S.C. 2, which treats those who aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure a federal crime as punishable as a principal. Aiding and abetting is more commonly prosecuted than causing a crime, requiring the defendant to associate themselves with the crime and actively participate in bringing it about. Aiding and abetting involves assisting in someone else's crime by actively participating in its success. The defendant must embrace the crime, know it is happening, and contribute to its success to be convicted. It does not require aiding in every aspect of the offense. At common law, all individuals involved in separate acts that together constitute one crime are considered principals. Aiding and abetting requires actively participating in a crime, embracing it, knowing it's happening, and contributing to its success for conviction. Common law considers all involved in separate acts forming one crime as principals. Aiding and abetting under \u00a72 requires assistance in a federal offense, as it describes how a defendant's conduct led to a law violation. Knowledge without assistance or assistance without intent is insufficient. In Standefer, the Supreme Court ruled that aiding and abetting requires actively participating in a crime and contributing to its success. A completed offense is necessary for conviction, and assistance must occur before or at the time of the offense. Accomplices may sometimes avoid federal principles of secondary criminal liability. Accomplices may sometimes avoid federal principles of secondary criminal liability by acting as an accessory after the fact. This typically occurs when there is a significant culpability gap between the accomplice and the primary offender. The cases often involve three types of accomplices: victims, customers, and subordinates. \"Victims\" can include those who pay extortion, blackmail, or ransom monies, but not every victim qualifies for this exception based on culpability. For example, a victim who actively participates in a scheme to corrupt a public official may be convicted and sentenced for bribery or as an accomplice to extortion. The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion by public officials, but victims who participate in corrupt schemes may be convicted for bribery or as accomplices to extortion. Customers like drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts have escaped conviction as co-conspirators. Supreme Court cases like United States v. Farrar and Rewis v. United States have ruled that mere customers cannot be prosecuted as aiders and abettors in illegal activities like selling liquor or gambling. The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) reinforces the view that a drug trafficker's customers cannot be prosecuted as coconspirators or aiders and abettors in his trafficking. Federal law punishes the trafficker severely for possession with intent to distribute, but it punishes the customer for simply possession. The CSA punishes drug traffickers severely for possession with intent to distribute, but customers are typically punished for simple possession. The Supreme Court ruled in Gebardi that individuals agreeing to be transported for immoral purposes cannot be charged with conspiracy under the Mann Act. Subordinates may have difficulty avoiding secondary liability. The Mann Act limits prosecution to cases where the prostitute only acquiesced in interstate transportation. OSHA's provisions do not allow prosecution of employees as aiders and abettors. Subordinates of offenders under the federal gambling business statute can be prosecuted. There is uncertainty on how subordinates of a drug kingpin may be treated. Willfully causing an act to be done that would be an offense is punishable as a principal. The language of \u00a72(b) leaves no doubt on crimes committed through an agent. Section 2(b) of the Mann Act applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. It imposes no liability unless the defendant's actions cause an underlying offense to be committed. The language of \u00a72(b) is clear on crimes committed through an agent, whether the intermediary is aware of their actions or not. The Mann Act's Section 2(b) applies to defendants using intermediaries, imposing liability if their actions cause an underlying offense, even if the intermediary is innocent. The 1951 amendment changed \"causes\" to \"willfully causes,\" with little explanation from Congress. Speculation suggests the addition of \"willfully\" addressed a lack of a mental element in \u00a72(b). The addition of the word \"willfully\" to Section 2(b) of the Mann Act was speculated to address a lack of a mental element in the provision. Courts interpret \"willfully\" as a form of intentional behavior, where an individual intentionally causes an offense by using someone else to commit it. Liability under Section 2(b) can be incurred even if the individual is unaware that the conduct is a crime. Federal courts also mention a withdrawal defense similar to that in conspiracy cases. In federal cases, withdrawal defense in aiding and abetting may be limited. A defendant must demonstrate affirmative action to withdraw from a conspiracy, such as informing authorities or coconspirators. Liability under aiding and abetting requires a completed offense, but it is unclear if withdrawal is possible if the crime still occurs despite abandonment. The withdrawal defense in aiding and abetting federal cases may be limited. A completed offense is required for liability, but it is uncertain if withdrawal is effective if the crime still happens despite abandonment. The question of withdrawing from aiding and abetting a crime remains unsettled, with varying results in different courts. Proponents of a general withdrawal defense may find support in recent dicta in Rosemond, where the Supreme Court clarified the requirement for an accomplice to know of the substantive offense beforehand. The Supreme Court clarified that an accomplice must know of the substantive offense beforehand to be held liable for aiding and abetting. There is no general civil aiding and abetting statute, so aiders and abettors may not be held civilly liable for violations of certain statutes, such as the Anti-Terrorism Act. Courts have determined that aiders and abettors are not civilly liable for violations of certain statutes like the Anti-Terrorism Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Stored Communications Act, or RICO."
