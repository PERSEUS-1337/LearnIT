    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Approximately 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the majority occurring in women aged 21 to 40. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) affects about two persons per million population per year, with cases reported in individuals of all ages and racial backgrounds. The low prevalence of PPH makes studying the disease challenging, especially due to the lack of a good animal model. In 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial. Advanced stages of PPH result in minimal activity and persistent symptoms. In advanced stages, PPH limits activity and causes symptoms even at rest. It can progress to complete bedriddenness. PPH is often missed in routine exams and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 1981 registry of 194 PPH patients provided valuable insights into the disease. The first PPH-patient registry in the world followed 194 people with PPH over 1 to 7.5 years, leading to valuable insights into the disease. Research is focusing on immunologic and genetic factors, pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, smooth muscle growth, and scar tissue formation. Anorexic drugs taken by almost 6,000,000 Americans from January 1996 to December 1997 can cause PPH in some individuals. Thousands now suffer from PPH as a result. During 1996-1997, nearly 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, leading to cases of PPH. SPH is caused by known factors such as emphysema, bronchitis, and certain diseases like scleroderma. Other causes include congenital heart defects. Causes of pulmonary hypertension include scleroderma, CREST syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital heart diseases, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute by intensifying activities and coordinating with other national research institutes and agencies. Grants and contracts will be made with public or nonprofit private entities for Centers of Excellence. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension through grants and contracts with public or nonprofit private entities for Centers of Excellence. These centers will conduct research, training programs, and provide information on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. The Centers of Excellence will focus on research, training programs, and information dissemination for pulmonary hypertension, including diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Stipends may be provided for scientists and health professionals in training programs. Coordination of centers and reporting requirements will be overseen by the Director. The Director will coordinate information among Centers of Excellence for pulmonary hypertension, ensuring regular communication and reports on activities. Each center will be based at a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions, meeting prescribed requirements. The Director will establish not less than three centers for pulmonary hypertension, each supported for up to 5 years with possible extensions. The centers must meet prescribed requirements and undergo peer review. The Director of the Institute will establish a data system and clearinghouse for pulmonary hypertension to collect, store, analyze, and disseminate data from patient populations, including those at risk of developing the condition. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate knowledge about pulmonary hypertension to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public. Additionally, the Director will provide means for public input on NIH programs related to primary hypertension and prepare biennial reports on activities conducted under this section. The Director of the Institute will prepare biennial reports on activities related to pulmonary hypertension and seek public input on NIH programs. Up to $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for this purpose."
