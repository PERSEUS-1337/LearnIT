The text discusses the limitations of modern machine vision algorithms in learning visual relations, highlighting the challenges faced by relational networks in solving visual question answering problems. It argues that feedback mechanisms like working memory and attention are crucial for abstract visual reasoning, inspired by the success of biological vision. The deep convolutional neural network accurately classifies images, surpassing human accuracy on the ImageNet classification challenge. However, the CNN struggles to recognize simple relations in images, such as the concept of \"sameness\" depicted in a binary image with two curves. Contemporary computer vision algorithms struggle to learn the concept of \"sameness\" in images, as shown in Fig. 1b from the SVRT challenge BID6. This difficulty has been overshadowed by the success of relational networks (RNs) on visual question answering benchmarks, but RNs have only been tested on toy datasets so far. Contemporary computer vision algorithms struggle with learning visual relations, despite the success of relational networks on visual question answering benchmarks. RNs have only been tested on toy datasets, highlighting the limitations of modern computer vision algorithms in understanding visual reasoning. Contemporary computer vision algorithms have difficulty with visual relations, as shown by previous studies on synthetic visual reasoning tests. Despite efforts with different CNN architectures and training schedules, the ability of feedforward neural networks to solve these problems remains inconclusive. In previous studies, feedforward neural networks struggled with visual relation tasks despite various CNN architectures and training schedules. A new study aims to systematically test the limits of CNNs and other visual reasoning networks on these tasks, revealing that both types of networks face challenges in solving visual-relation problems. This highlights the need to explore the underlying brain mechanisms, such as working memory and attention, that enable primates to reason about visual relations. The study reveals limitations in CNNs and RNs for visual-relation tasks, suggesting the need for brain mechanisms like working memory and attention. Three contributions are outlined: systematic analysis of CNN performance on SVRT problems, demonstration of CNNs' reliance on rote memorization for same-different tasks, and a modification to the sort-of-CLEVR challenge. The SVRT challenge presents binary classification problems highlighting abstract rules, revealing CNNs' reliance on rote memorization for visual tasks. This challenges existing visual question answering approaches and suggests looking to neuroscience for inspiration in designing visual reasoning architectures. The SVRT challenge involves binary classification problems where stimuli obey abstract rules. CNNs were trained on these problems, with lower accuracies observed on same-different problems. CNNs from a high-throughput analysis showed lower accuracies on same-different problems compared to spatial-relation problems. Different network depths and receptive field sizes were tested, with all networks using pooling kernels of size 3\u00d73 and ReLu activations. All networks used pooling kernels of size 3\u00d73, convolutional strides of 1, and three fully connected layers with ReLu activations. 2 million examples split evenly into training and test sets were generated for each of the twenty-three problems. The networks were trained on each problem using an ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of \u03b7 = 10 \u22124. The best networks' accuracy for each problem was sorted and colored red or blue based on the SVRT problem descriptions provided by BID6, with red indicating Same-Different (SD) problems. The SVRT problems were sorted by accuracy and colored red or blue based on their descriptions. Same-Different (SD) problems with words like \"same\" were colored red, while Spatial-Relation (SR) problems with phrases like \"left of\" were colored blue. CNNs performed worse on SD problems compared to SR problems, indicating a difficulty with SD tasks. This aligns with earlier evidence of a visual-relation dichotomy provided by BID26. The analysis shows that CNNs struggle with Same-Different (SD) tasks, with some problems resulting in accuracy not much better than chance. Larger networks perform better on SD problems, while Spatial-Relation (SR) problems are equally well-learned across all network configurations. This aligns with previous evidence of a visual-relation dichotomy and supports the findings of earlier studies on feedforward models' poor performance on visual-relation problems. Experiment 1 confirms previous studies showing feedforward models struggle with visual-relation problems. The SVRT challenge has limitations in its sample of visual relations. Figure 3 shows sample PSVRT images with four joint categories of SD and SR. Images are classified as Same or Different based on square bit patterns and as Horizontal or Vertical based on displacement orientation. Problems vary in structure, making direct comparisons challenging. For example, Problem 2 requires images with one large... A direct comparison between visual-relation problems is challenging due to different image structures and unique generation methods. For instance, Problem 2 requires one large and one small object, conflicting with Problem 1 where two identically-sized objects are needed. Comparing problems on the same set of images is suggested for better analysis. Using closed curves in SVRT images hinders quantification and control of image variability. The PSVRT challenge addresses issues with SVRT by introducing two idealized problems: Spatial Relations (SR) and Same-Different (SD). This new dataset aims to overcome difficulties in quantifying image variability and controlling task difficulty. The new dataset for the PSVRT challenge includes two problems: Spatial Relations (SR) and Same-Different (SD). Images are classified based on orientation and item similarity. The image generator creates gray-scale images using binary bit patterns on a blank background. The image generator creates gray-scale images using binary bit patterns on a blank background, with parameters controlling image variability at the item and spatial levels. The number of items in the image determines the category labels for SR and SD classification. The image generator creates gray-scale images using binary bit patterns on a blank background, with parameters controlling image variability at the item and spatial levels. Each image is generated by drawing a joint class label for SD and SR from a uniform distribution, and the number of possible images in a dataset can be quantified using a parametric test called Parametric SVRT (PSVRT). The image generator creates gray-scale images with parameters controlling variability. Images are generated by drawing joint class labels for SD and SR from a uniform distribution. The goal is to examine the difficulty of learning PSVRT problems with different image variability parameters. In an experiment to examine the difficulty of learning PSVRT problems with varying image variability parameters, a baseline architecture was identified. The architecture successfully learned both same-different and spatial-relation PSVRT problems for specific parameter configurations. Training sessions were conducted for different combinations of item size, image size, and item number to measure the difficulty of fitting the training data. The number of training examples required for the architecture to reach 95% accuracy was used as a measure of problem difficulty. The study aimed to assess problem difficulty using TTA as a measure. The network was trained from scratch in various conditions without a holdout test set. Three sub-experiments were conducted by varying image parameters individually. The baseline CNN was trained in each condition with 20 million images and a batch size of 50. The best-case result for each condition was reported based on 10 random initializations. The baseline CNN was trained from scratch with 20 million images and a batch size of 50. It had four convolution and pool layers, followed by four fully-connected layers. The network used dropout in the last fully-connected layer with a probability of 0.5 and an ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of \u03b7 = 10 \u22124. The weights were initialized using the Xavier method. The study used an ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of \u03b7 = 10 \u22124 and weights initialized with the Xavier method. Experiments were also conducted with a larger network size. A strong dichotomy in learning curves was observed, with a sudden rise in accuracy from chance-level termed as the \"learning event\". Training runs that exhibited this event almost always reached 95% accuracy within 20 iterations. The study observed a strong bi-modality in final accuracy, with either chance-level or close to 100%. In some experimental conditions, a learning event occurred immediately after training began, leading to 95% accuracy. However, in other conditions, a significant straining effect was found from certain image parameters. In some experimental conditions, a learning event occurred immediately after training began, leading to 95% accuracy. However, in SD, a significant straining effect was found from image size and number of items. Increasing image size increased TTA and made learning less likely. The network struggled to learn SD with larger images and when there were 3 or more items in an image. The network struggled to learn the problem when there were 3 or more items in an image, even with a relaxation of the same-different rule. The increase in the number of \"same\" templates imposed a severe strain on CNNs due to the exponential relationship between image size and item number in contributing to image variability. Increasing image size with a constant number of items results in a quadratic-rate increase in image variability, while increasing the number of items leads to an exponential-rate increase. The straining effect was strong between two CNNs with different network widths, causing a rightward shift in the TTA curve over image sizes. However, increasing item size had no visible straining effect on CNNs. Learnability remained stable across different item sizes. When CNNs learn a PSVRT condition, they build a feature set tailored for a specific dataset rather than learning the rule itself. It is possible to construct feedforward feature detectors that can generalize to coordinated item variability, but direct evidence is lacking. Learnability is preserved and stable over a range of item sizes considered. The CNNs in this experiment did not learn invariant rule-detectors but rather a collection of templates covering a specific distribution in the image space. The Relational Network (RN) was proposed as an architecture explicitly designed to detect visual relations. The Relational Network (RN) is an architecture designed to detect visual relations and outperforms a baseline CNN on various visual reasoning problems, including the \"sort-of-CLEVR\" VQA task. The Relational Network (RN) outperformed a baseline CNN on visual reasoning tasks, including the \"sort-of-CLEVR\" VQA task. The RN excelled in answering relational and non-relational questions using images with simple 2D items, showcasing superior performance compared to the CNN. The Relational Network (RN) excelled in visual reasoning tasks by comparing attributes of cued items without the need to learn the concept of sameness. Training the model on a two-item same-different task and PSVRT stimuli aimed to measure its ability to transfer concepts, serving as a benchmark for visual reasoning models. Architecture details were based on publicly available software for relational networks. The architecture details of the model included a convolutional network with four layers, a relational network with multiple layers of MLP, ReLu activations, dropout, and softmax function. The system was trained with a cross-entropy loss using an ADAM optimizer. The model architecture included a convolutional network with four layers, ReLu activations, and 50% dropout. The final layer used a softmax function and was trained with cross-entropy loss using an ADAM optimizer. We confirmed that this model reproduced results from BID22 on the sort-of-CLEVR task by training it on twelve different versions of the dataset. Each dataset depicted two items, with half being the same color and shape. The CNN+RN architecture was trained to detect the sameness of the two scene items. The CNN+RN architecture was trained on datasets with twelve color+shape combinations, detecting sameness of two scene items. Learning stopped at 95% training accuracy, but the model did not generalize well to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. The model learns faster due to fewer items to generalize across, with training accuracy reaching 90% while validation accuracy remains at chance. The model trained on CNN+RN architecture learns faster on datasets with fewer items, reaching 90% training accuracy but struggles to generalize to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. There is no transfer of same-different ability to the validation data, even though attributes from the left-out condition were represented in the training set. The CNN+RN architecture trained on datasets with fewer items reaches 90% training accuracy but struggles to generalize to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. The model's performance on validation data is not transferred, even though attributes from the left-out condition were in the training set. The system's accuracy leaps to over 95% for image sizes of 120 or below, but does not learn for sizes of 150 and 180, possibly due to the RN architecture's representational capacity. The CNN+RN architecture struggles to generalize to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. The system's accuracy reaches over 95% for image sizes of 120 or below, but does not learn for sizes of 150 and 180, indicating a limitation in the representational capacity of CNNs for visual-relation problems. The limitations of feedforward networks in representing stimuli with combinatorial structures have been overlooked by computer vision scientists. Humans excel at detecting relations in visual systems and can learn complicated visual rules with just a few training examples. For example, participants in a study could learn a complex visual rule involving reflection from only about 6 examples. Visual reasoning ability is not limited to humans, as birds and primates have also shown the ability to recognize same-different relations and transfer this knowledge to novel objects. A study with ducklings demonstrated their one-shot learning capability, where they were able to distinguish between same and different 3D objects after being exposed to just one pair during training. Ducklings demonstrated one-shot learning by distinguishing between same and different 3D objects after exposure to a single pair during training. This suggests rapid abstract concept learning or innate knowledge. In contrast, CNN+RN in Experiment 3 failed to transfer this concept to novel objects even after extensive training. This highlights the neural substrate of visual-relation detection in animals. There is evidence that visual-relation detection in the brain may rely on reentrant/feedback signals in addition to feedforward processes. While some visual recognition tasks can be accomplished with minimal cortical feedback, object localization in clutter may require attention. Object localization in cluttered scenes requires attention and the processing of spatial relations between objects in a cluttered scene also necessitates attention. Working memory in prefrontal and premotor cortices plays a role in our ability to process visual relations. The computational role of attention and working memory in detecting visual relations involves constructing flexible representations dynamically at run-time through attention shifts, rather than storing visual-relation templates statically. This approach helps prevent capacity overload associated with feedforward neural networks. Humans have a superior ability to detect visual relations compared to modern computers. By dynamically constructing representations at run-time through attention shifts, they can effortlessly create structured descriptions about the visual world around them. This highlights the importance of exploring attentional and mnemonic mechanisms in computational understanding of visual reasoning."
