    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, but several states have legalized medical and recreational use. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, followed by Alaska and Oregon in 2014. Commercial sales of recreational marijuana became legal in Colorado on January 1, 2014, making it the first jurisdiction in the world to do so. Washington's commercial marijuana market opened on July 7, 2014, followed by Alaska and Oregon on November 4, 2014. The District of Columbia also approved measures to legalize the cultivation, possession, and exchange of marijuana. Polls show a majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana, leading to increased debate on the topic. The shift in popular sentiment towards marijuana legalization is evident in polls conducted by Rassmussen, the Pew Research Center, and Gallup, showing a majority of Americans in favor. This has sparked debates at the federal level, with bills introduced in the 113th Congress to remove marijuana from Schedule I drugs and impose a federal excise tax. The establishment of a National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy is also proposed to review revenue potential. The debate on marijuana legalization encompasses various issues like criminal justice and public health, with the potential revenue from a marijuana tax being a key consideration. The debate on marijuana legalization includes discussions on potential revenue from taxing marijuana. This report focuses on imposing an excise tax on legalized marijuana, analyzing arguments for taxes and possible tax designs. Marijuana is derived from the plant Cannabis sativa and is used for recreational or medicinal purposes. Marijuana tax designs are analyzed, focusing on the psychoactive effects of THC and other cannabinoids in different strains of marijuana. Consumers may seek strains high in CBD for anxiety relief. Marijuana strains vary in cannabinoid content, with high CBD strains sought for anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can differ based on preparation. Female plants grown without pollination produce resin-rich buds with high THC content. Plants grown in controlled environments produce resin-rich buds with high THC content. Marijuana is consumed by smoking, with various methods like joints and blunts. Other devices like glass pipes and vaporizers are also used for consumption. Various devices for consuming marijuana exist, including joints, glass pipes, and vaporizers. Cannabis can also be processed into different products with varying THC concentrations, such as hashish and edibles. Excise taxes on marijuana are considered less desirable than more general taxes. The section discusses reasons for imposing an excise tax on marijuana, such as reflecting external costs, discouraging use, preventing price falls too rapidly, funding programs, and raising revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price equals costs, and if marijuana consumption imposes costs on others, a tax could help achieve economic efficiency. Similar justifications have been used for alcohol and tobacco. The rationale for imposing a tax on marijuana is to reflect external costs and achieve economic efficiency. If consumption imposes costs on others, a tax could help. Society bears the loss of tax revenue from early death and some costs of treating illness. Discounted future costs should be considered. The external costs of marijuana use, like alcohol and tobacco, are typically smaller than the total costs. A study estimated a cost of $30 billion for alcohol, which can be used to estimate the cost for marijuana. No U.S. study on marijuana could be found, but comparing costs of cannabis use to alcohol can help determine the necessary tax to correct for externalities. A British study compared the harm of alcohol and cannabis, with alcohol ranking 72 and cannabis ranking 20. External harm for alcohol was 47, while for cannabis it was 9. A Canadian study found health costs per user for cannabis to be about 12%. Non-health costs of marijuana are likely lower than for alcohol, with evidence suggesting marijuana impairs driving less and is inversely related to domestic violence. Enforcement costs for marijuana were found to be higher in the Canadian study. The effect of marijuana on driving ability is found to be less than alcohol. Evidence suggests marijuana use is inversely related to domestic violence. Marijuana has lower externalities per user compared to alcohol, with usage rates much lower than alcohol. The prevalence of marijuana usage among individuals aged 12 and older is 12.6% in the past year and 7.5% in the past month, compared to alcohol usage at 66.3% and 52.2% respectively. Marijuana is estimated to have external costs ranging from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. A 2014 report by the White House ONDCP provides data on marijuana market size, price, and consumption in the United States. The ONDCP report analyzed data from the NSDUH and ADAM surveys, showing a 40% increase in marijuana consumption in the US from 2002 to 2010. Estimates of total expenditures on marijuana in 2010 ranged from $30 billion to $60 billion. THC levels in marijuana also rose during this period. The report suggests a potential tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price based on external cost estimates. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of marijuana prices from 2000 to 2010, showing a nominal price that remained constant while the inflation-adjusted price likely decreased. In 2010, the price per gram was $7.11. Anecdotal prices from anonymous sources and informal interviews, along with data from priceofweed.com, offer additional insights into marijuana pricing across various locations. The price of marijuana can be estimated using data from priceofweed.com, with prices ranging from $224 to $317 per ounce. Anecdotal reports suggest prices as low as $28 per eighth of an ounce in some areas. Tax rates of 0.8% to 5.3% are applied to the price, which is currently higher than production costs. In a legal market, marijuana prices would be lower than the current illicit market prices. Estimates suggest external costs range from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce with tax rates of 0.8% to 5.3%. The price in a competitive market could be as low as $5 per ounce. The largest estimate equates to $0.30 per joint, compared to federal taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic drinks. The largest estimate for the tax on a joint is $0.30, similar to the tax on a six-pack of beer. States and localities also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and they would likely tax marijuana as well. These state taxes may already exceed the external costs of marijuana. Despite uncertainties, the available information suggests a relatively small tax compared to current prices. The external costs of marijuana are uncertain, but suggest a small tax compared to current prices. Imposing a tax could discourage users who underestimate long-term health costs and dependence risks. Studies show about 9% of users become dependent, with medical marijuana laws increasing abuse probability. More research is needed to improve understanding of marijuana risks. Another study found that medical marijuana laws in the United States increase the probability of marijuana abuse or dependency by 15%-27% among adults aged 21 or older. Economists debate whether users' behavior is rational or influenced by hyperbolic discounting. The issue of determining a tax for the best interests of users is complex, as it may reduce income while aiming to increase welfare. An important issue in determining a tax for marijuana users is that it may reduce income while aiming to increase welfare. Heavy users consume a disproportionate share of marijuana, similar to alcohol use, with 20% of users accounting for 80% of consumption. A marijuana tax, like alcohol and tobacco taxes, would primarily burden heavy users and may be regressive. However, current users may benefit from lower prices if marijuana is legalized. A tax on marijuana, like most excise taxes, may be regressive and undesirable for users. Evaluating the benefit of imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on users' response to price changes, expressed as elasticities by economists. If the price elasticity is low, the tax may harm users with little change in consumption. Gallet (2014) analyzed 42 studies on illicit drug demand, including 13 on marijuana, finding price elasticity of demand for marijuana between -0.15 and -0.31. This means a 1% price increase leads to a 0.15% to 0.31% decrease in demand, showing consumers are not highly responsive to price changes. Therefore, imposing a tax on marijuana may harm users with minimal impact on consumption. Consumer demand for marijuana is not highly responsive to price changes, with estimates of price elasticity between -0.15 and -0.31. Imposing a tax on marijuana may harm users more than it benefits them, as gains from optimal consumption may be offset by lost income. Government policies aimed at limiting drug use by minors may be more effective, as estimates show larger price elasticity for youth, with an estimate of -1.01 for ages 12-17. Imposing a tax on marijuana may harm users more than it benefits them, as gains from optimal consumption may be offset by lost income. Government policies aimed at limiting drug use by minors may be more effective, with estimates showing larger price elasticity for youth. The policy question is how much of a tax burden should be placed on non-responsive adult users to limit consumption among youth. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. This may lead to a need for a tax to prevent prices from falling too low until the effects of a legal market are understood. The tax level may need to be adjusted based on the outcomes of legalization. A legalized market for marijuana could lead to lower production costs and increased competition, resulting in lower prices. A federal tax rate could be considered based on the difference between projected costs in a legal market and current illicit production prices. The tax should be set at a level that prevents prices from falling too low initially. The difference between projected costs in a legal market and current illicit production prices can guide the setting of a federal tax rate for legalized marijuana. Caulkins (2010) estimates production costs, with outdoor cultivation being more cost-effective but potentially lower in THC levels. The estimated production costs for high-quality marijuana vary depending on cultivation method. Outdoor production costs less per pound but may have lower THC levels compared to indoor cultivation. Processing costs are estimated to add $20 to $35 per pound. Greenhouse production costs around $215 plus $35 per pound for processing, while outdoor production costs around $10 plus $35 per pound. THC concentration in marijuana products can range from 10% to 18%. The cost of producing high-quality marijuana varies depending on cultivation method, with estimates ranging from $2.80 to $18 per ounce. Prices in quasi-legal jurisdictions tend to be lower than street prices but higher than production costs. In Canada, government-sponsored marijuana can be produced for as low as 33 cents per gram, while retail market prices are around $2.80 per ounce. Medical marijuana prices in Canada range from $1.80 to $5 per gram, or $50 to $140 per ounce. In quasi-legal jurisdictions, prices for medical marijuana in Canada range from $1.80 to $5 per gram or $50 to $140 per ounce for the final consumer. Suppliers can provide for $1 to $4 per gram or $28 to $110 per ounce. Street prices are higher at $10 to $15 per gram or $280 to $420 per ounce. The Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram in April 2014, closer to street prices. Small growers and homegrown marijuana are no longer permitted under the new law. The Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram, higher than the current average and closer to street prices. Small growers and homegrown marijuana are no longer permitted under the new law. Actual prices can be observed on websites like Leafly.com, which provides consumer reviews and menu prices of products available at marijuana shops in Colorado. Leafly provides consumer reviews and prices of marijuana products in Colorado. Prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices in Colorado are lower than the national average, with high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. Colorado marijuana prices are lower than the national average, with high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. Prices reflect a mix of illicit and legal markets, indicating falling prices with legalization. However, prices are not close to production costs due to quasi-legal status. Producers face challenges with banking assistance and high federal taxes. Media reports suggest that marijuana producers struggle to access banking services and face high federal taxes. These businesses are at risk of federal enforcement. Studies show that legalization could significantly reduce marijuana prices, with estimates ranging from 50% to over 80%. The price of marijuana could decrease by more than 80%, with estimates ranging from $40-$60 per ounce to $100-$150 per ounce. Street prices currently range from $200-$300 per ounce, suggesting room for taxes up to $200 per ounce to align with legalized prices. The potential scope of marijuana tax differences is uncertain, but setting taxes too high could encourage the illicit market. Lowering taxes and monitoring market conditions may be the best initial strategy. Tax revenue could fund marijuana research, especially for medical marijuana approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Tax revenue from marijuana could fund research on its medical effects, which could provide guidance to patients and doctors. Research is hindered by federal approval barriers and the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Legalization would allow for studying a wide range of issues related to marijuana. The curr_chunk discusses the potential benefits of marijuana for various conditions and the need for further research on its efficacy and side effects. Legalization could allow for studying externalities, addictive properties, and health effects on both recreational and medical users. Tax revenue from marijuana could be used to finance information programs on the risks of marijuana use and discourage consumption by minors. Excise taxes on marijuana could be designed to achieve a specific revenue target. An excise tax on marijuana can be designed to achieve a revenue target, with uncertain outcomes due to market variables. Legalization may attract casual consumers, increasing revenue beyond current estimates. The legal market could potentially be much larger than anticipated. The potential revenue from nationwide marijuana legalization could be larger than current estimates due to effects not captured in existing price elasticity estimates. The pace of legalization at the state level could impact federal excise tax revenue, with constraints on tax rates to equalize prices between legal and illicit markets. Analysts have used economic models to estimate potential revenue from legalization. Analysts estimate that nationwide marijuana legalization could generate significant revenue through federal excise taxes, with a potential annual revenue of $5.8 billion. This calculation is based on a 50% tax rate on the consumer price, leading to a projected $13.13 billion national market for marijuana. Additionally, there could be $3.3 billion in annual savings from reduced law enforcement expenditures. The estimated national market for marijuana is $13.13 billion in 2008, with a projected 50% price decrease and 25% consumption increase after legalization. Analysts suggest a $50-$75 per ounce tax, estimating potential annual revenue of $5.8 billion from federal excise taxes. This calculation considers the effects on aggregate consumption and interactions with income taxes, dependent on market conditions and tax rates. The potential revenue from federal excise taxes on marijuana legalization depends on market conditions and tax rates. Assuming a $40 billion market and a $250 current price, with a $50 per ounce federal tax, the total price would be $150 per ounce. The federal excise tax collection would be $50 multiplied by the quantity in ounces. The federal excise tax revenue from marijuana legalization, based on a $40 billion market and a $250 current price with a $50 federal tax per ounce, would be approximately $8 billion. Legalization would lead to a 50% increase in quantity due to a price reduction to $50 per ounce, assuming a price elasticity of -0.25. The price elasticity formula is used to calculate the effect of legalization on marijuana prices. Assuming a price elasticity of -0.25, legalization would lead to a 50% increase in quantity with a price reduction to $50 per ounce. With taxes, the price becomes $150, resulting in a 14% increase in quantity and projected excise tax revenue of $6.8 billion. This estimate is subject to change based on assumptions and the extent of legalization movement. The projected revenue gain from marijuana taxes is $6.8 billion, based on assumptions that could change. The short-term yield might be less than $300 million due to limited legalization in Colorado and Washington. Taxing medical marijuana in other states could increase revenue. Data from Colorado and Washington could indicate the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Marijuana sales in Colorado are subject to multiple state taxes, including a 15% excise tax, a 10% retail excise tax, and a 2.9% general sales tax. The total tax rate ranges from 15% to 25%. Local taxes may also apply. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in taxes and fees on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014. The state of Colorado imposes a 2.9% general sales tax on marijuana sales, with additional local taxes like the Denver city sales tax. From January to September 2014, Colorado collected over $37.0 million in taxes and fees on recreational marijuana. By extrapolating this data, the national market for marijuana could be estimated to be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. The national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year, based on market conditions in Colorado. Medical marijuana consumption could roughly double that base. Combined sales in Colorado suggest a market of at least $30 billion, which is small compared to most estimates. Illicit sales may still be prevalent due to lower prices or existing black market relationships. The Colorado market may have substantial levels of illicit sales due to lower prices or preexisting relationships in the black market. Consumption in Colorado could be overstated because of non-resident sales. The issue of exempting medical marijuana and enforcing any exemption is important. Design issues for an excise tax include levying it at earlier production stages to reduce administrative costs and opportunities for tax evasion. Implementing an excise tax at the consumer retail outlet often duplicates processes. Federal excise taxes on marijuana are generally levied on manufacturers and imports, with an exemption for exports. The tax can be based on a per unit measurement or the product price, with advantages and disadvantages to each. A tax by weight is easy to administer, similar to the regime for tobacco. The tax could be based on the \"wet\" weight or the weight after processing. A weight-based tax for marijuana could be administered at the manufacturing level, either based on the \"wet\" weight or after drying. However, a potency-based tax, which is based on THC content per ounce, could be more complex and costly to enforce due to the need for accurate lab testing of marijuana strains. Regulations would need to define the sampling requirements for producers to ensure reliability. Enforcing a potency-based tax on marijuana would require accurate lab testing of strains, with costs ranging from $60-$120 per sample. More labs entering the market could lead to price reductions and improved technology, but reliability in measuring THC content may still be a challenge. Enforcing a potency-based tax on marijuana could lead to challenges in measuring final THC content reliably, potentially encouraging consumption of less-potent marijuana. An alternative approach could be basing the tax on the THC to CBD ratio to promote marijuana with more sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, levied as a percentage of the sales price, offer advantages in adjusting for market fluctuations. A tax based on the THC to CBD ratio could promote marijuana with sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, as a percentage of sales price, automatically adjust for market changes and are used in Colorado, Washington, and proposed in H.R. 501. The main disadvantage is the need for regulations to specify taxable prices. An ad valorem tax requires regulations to specify the taxable price it applies to, especially for manufacturers. Federal excise taxes are often imposed at the manufacturer stage, while retail tax regimes can capture price markups. The price of products like marijuana can be influenced by factors other than intoxication potential. A sales tax for marijuana products could be based on factors like branding or market power. The tax rate could be adjusted for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Sunset provisions could be included in the tax laws to adapt to changing conditions after legalization. To adapt to changing conditions after legalization, sunset provisions for a marijuana tax could be included in the initial authorizing language. This could involve setting a low initial tax rate to undermine the illicit market, gradually increasing it to limit consumption, or delegating authority to adjust rates based on certain criteria. Various methods of taxation, such as a general tax based on price or weight with surcharges for higher-THC products, could be combined to shape consumption patterns. A federal marijuana tax could be implemented with differential rates based on THC content or product type, similar to alcohol taxation. However, this approach may lead to unequal tax burdens among consumers. Lawmakers would also need to consider integrating existing marijuana stocks into the tax base. A federal marijuana tax could be implemented with differential rates based on THC content or product type, similar to alcohol taxation. Lawmakers would have to address the taxation of marijuana plants and consumer goods in legalized jurisdictions. Integrating preexisting marijuana stocks into the tax base could help meet initial demand, simplify tax regulations, and increase federal tax revenue, but some products may not comply with new regulations. An alternative option could include a lead time between tax enactment. Some preexisting marijuana plants and products may not comply with new federal regulations accompanying a federal tax regime. An alternative option could be to provide lead time between tax enactment and the first legalized sales to allow producers to comply. This approach, seen in Colorado and Washington, adds complexity to the taxation of marijuana but helps legal producers compete with the underground market. In Washington, existing medical marijuana dispensaries can convert current plants to legal stocks with a producer license. Federal excise taxes on marijuana could lead to tax on untaxed floor stocks, with exemptions for small retail operations. Policy makers may decide on federal regulations or allow states to create their own laws. Differential tax treatments would complicate the tax system. State laws in Colorado and Washington restrict recreational marijuana purchases. State laws in Colorado and Washington limit recreational marijuana purchases to individuals aged 21 or older, which could impact the tax base. Excluding younger consumers may lead to underground production or indirect sales through of-age connections. The legal tax base in Colorado allows for some underground production and indirect sales of marijuana. Residents can possess up to one ounce, while non-residents are limited to purchasing one quarter of an ounce. Restrictions aim to reduce diversion risks, but the impact is still uncertain. More restrictive purchasing limits and ad valorem tax rates can increase taxes on heavy users benefiting from bulk discounts. Production limits may be based on total consumption. Washington has a target of 80 metric tons for its marijuana market, with production limits based on market size or per grower. Concerns about diversion to other states or countries where marijuana is illegal are addressed through tax administration closer to production. Mark Kleiman, Professor of Public Policy at UCLA, emphasizes the importance of monitoring diversion. The implementation of production limits for marijuana in legal markets is debated, with concerns about diversion and the potential inefficiency and windfall profits it may generate. Mark Kleiman suggests that production limits could curb negative social consequences and prevent larger producers from dominating the market. However, the federal government has never considered production limits for any other commodity, and it is unlikely to work effectively in a national legal market. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies in jurisdictions that have legalized it, with different sales taxes applied. Medical marijuana use is contentious, with some evidence showing a decrease in prescription drug overdoses in states with medical marijuana laws. The use of medical marijuana may be more appealing to consumers who avoid the illicit market. Evidence suggests a decrease in prescription drug overdoses in states with medical marijuana laws. Exempting medical marijuana from taxes could lead to abuse if strict standards are not enforced, potentially limiting the tax base. Exempting medical marijuana from taxes could lead to abuse if strict standards are not enforced, potentially limiting the tax base. Rules vary for products subject to excise taxation, with different regulations in Colorado and Washington. Home production exemptions raise questions about quantity limits and enforcement. Home production of wine, beer, and tobacco can be limited, with questions about quantity limits and taxation exemptions. A single marijuana plant can yield a pound of marijuana, but home-growing may not pose a significant threat to tax revenue. However, home production could undermine enforcement efforts. Caulkins et al. suggest that banning home production of marijuana could undermine enforcement efforts and increase tax revenue. Small producers could be eligible for lower tax rates, similar to exemptions for wine and beer producers. However, a small businesses exemption may lead to evasion and go against the objective of efficient tax collection from larger producers. In general, it is more efficient to collect taxes from larger marijuana producers. A small business exemption could lead to evasion and encourage indoor cultivation for higher potency. Another option is to apply a lower tax to outdoor marijuana cultivation, which uses less energy. Outdoor cultivation may have negative environmental effects like land and water diversion. Another suggestion is to levy a special occupational tax on any marijuana business. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana production could lead to indoor cultivation. A federal tax option is to impose a special occupational tax on marijuana businesses, similar to taxes in the tobacco and firearms industries. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes a $1,000 annual tax on producers and a $500 tax on others in the marijuana industry. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 (H.R. 501) proposes an occupational tax on marijuana producers, importers, and manufacturers. History shows that enforcement efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, similar to the measures taken after Prohibition to combat bootleg spirits. Today, effective enforcement would deter consumers from engaging in illicit transactions with trusted dealers. Enforcing alcohol-related laws in the late 1930s involved hiring over 1,000 agents. Today, enforcing marijuana laws would require deterring consumers from illegal transactions with trusted dealers and compelling producers to get licenses and pay taxes. Legalizing and taxing marijuana without adequate resources for tax enforcement could harm the federal tax base. Marijuana smuggling may be more common than illegal alcohol production due to its compactness and ease of transport. Taxing closer to production could help reduce taxable transactions. Marijuana is more prevalent than illegal alcohol production due to its compactness and ease of transport. Taxing closer to production could reduce taxable entities and increase monitoring efficiency. Various methods like tax stamps, seals on packages, individual marks on joints, and new technologies like genetic markers are discussed for tax enforcement. Colorado has implemented a system to track marijuana plants from seed to sale using RFID tags. Marijuana enterprises must report their inventory through a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions. These systems complement traditional enforcement methods like physical surveillance. Regulations are being considered to standardize weights and potency measurements. The Marijuana Enforcement Division uses a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS) to complement traditional enforcement methods. Regulations may be needed to standardize weights and potency measurements for a marijuana tax regime, contributing to consumer safety and accurate dosing. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different marijuana strains to inform consumers and prevent competition from products that do not meet the same standards. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for labeling marijuana strains, tax rates for medical and recreational marijuana, enforcement of regulations for nonprofit dispensaries, changes in U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp, and the Agricultural Act of 2014. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate, allowing research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp, with low THC concentrations, could be legalized for industrial production and exempted from taxation if marijuana is legalized for commercial production. Proposed legislation in the U.S. suggests distinguishing hemp from marijuana for tax purposes based on THC content. Hemp could be distinguished from marijuana for tax purposes based on THC content. Europe and Canada require less than 0.3% THC to differentiate legal hemp from illegal marijuana. The claim that marijuana can be hidden in hemp fields is likely overstated due to cross-pollination weakening marijuana plants. Higher-quality marijuana strains need controlled climates to reach peak THC potency. The federal decision on legalization could have significant effects. Some experts suggest that federal legalization of marijuana could impact state tax policies. States with legalization laws may opt for licensing private businesses for marijuana sales instead of state-based monopolies. Proponents see monopolies as a way to regulate consumption, while opponents view them as prone to corruption and driven by revenue motives. State-based monopolies are seen as a tool for regulating consumption, but opponents argue they are susceptible to corruption and driven by revenue motives. The dominance of licensing systems across states could make it difficult for lawmakers to roll back such systems and encourage state monopolies in the future. Uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana markets include post-legalization prices, market size, and consumer responses to price changes. The uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana markets, such as post-legalization prices, market size, and consumer responses to price changes, make revenue projections and tax implementation challenging. The limited tax base for legalized marijuana sales, especially if medical marijuana is exempt from federal taxation, further complicates the issue. The tax base for legalized marijuana sales is limited compared to alcohol or tobacco, especially if medical marijuana is exempt from federal taxation. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption affects the social costs of legalization. If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol, it may have positive spillover effects on society. Researchers have not reached a consensus on the social effects of marijuana consumption when compared to alcohol consumption. Economic studies may not accurately capture the long-term effects or representative samples. Marijuana research in the US is highly regulated by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana research in the US is highly regulated by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which does not fund research on the potential medical benefits of marijuana. The effects of commercial and recreational legalization have not been fully studied on the scale of Colorado or Washington. This uncertainty limits the plausibility of levying a marijuana tax based on external costs to society. The social costs of marijuana legalization could vary based on polydrug use, with studies showing lower addiction risk compared to other drugs. Some believe marijuana is a gateway drug. About 10% of infrequent marijuana users also use other illegal drugs. Studies indicate that marijuana has a lower risk of addiction and abuse compared to cocaine, crack, or heroin. Some believe it is a \"gateway drug\" to further illicit drug use. Survey data shows that 10% of infrequent marijuana users also use other illegal drugs, while heavy users have a rate of over 25%. Current research on marijuana's effects on traffic fatalities is limited by methodological issues. Marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in crashes. Studies have shown that marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in crashes, but there is no clear causal link to traffic fatalities. Testing technology for marijuana intoxication is limited, as it can remain detectable in the body for up to a week after use. This prevalence should be seen as an indicator of use, not necessarily impairment. Some studies suggest that marijuana can be detected in drivers involved in crashes for up to a week after use, but this does not necessarily indicate impairment. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to savings in criminal justice spending, with estimates suggesting up to $7.7 billion per year in enforcement costs. Legalizing marijuana could potentially save billions in criminal justice spending at state and federal levels. Estimates vary, with some suggesting savings of $7.7 billion per year in enforcement costs. Research shows that a small percentage of state and federal prison inmates are marijuana-only offenders, with the majority of drug-related sentences being for trafficking offenses. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 31.2% of offenders in FY2013 were sentenced to federal prison for drug-related offenses, with 28.4% of sentences related to marijuana. Legalizing marijuana could potentially reduce the prison population by 2% over time, with minimal impact on current inmates serving marijuana-related charges. Legalizing marijuana could lead to a 2% reduction in the prison population over time, with minimal impact on current inmates. The majority of costs associated with the black market for drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. The black market for illicit drugs is mainly associated with illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana, due to the higher price per pound of these drugs. Marijuana exchanges often occur indoors among known parties, reducing conflict risk. Marijuana producers and retailers cannot deduct expenses like payroll and rent for federal tax purposes under IRC Section 280E. Revenue Code Section 280E prohibits deductions for expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business involving controlled substances. The IRS has enforced this provision on marijuana-related businesses, leading to a tax on these businesses equal to the value of the disallowed deductions. Some businesses have challenged this practice in court. The IRS enforces Revenue Code Section 280E, prohibiting deductions for expenses in marijuana-related businesses, leading to tax penalties. Businesses like Canna Care challenge these practices in court, facing discrepancies in federal and state tax treatments. This creates economic incentives for underground activities. The current tax laws create economic incentives for underground marijuana businesses due to the inability to deduct business expenses, resulting in implicit taxes up to 39.6% for sole proprietors or partnerships and 35% for corporations. Illicit sellers have an advantage as they are not directly taxed on their sales, while the Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant state law marijuana businesses from certain tax restrictions. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant state law marijuana businesses from certain tax restrictions, allowing for tax credits and deductions. Data from Colorado and Washington can be used to estimate the national marijuana tax base, although it may underrepresent total demand due to pending licenses and unknown effects on the underground market. For this report, recent tax revenue data from Colorado is used to estimate the state's marijuana tax base. The recreational tax base is calculated using data from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax. The two tax bases are averaged to determine a monthly aggregate tax base for recreational sales. The Colorado Department of Revenue reported that the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 in September 2014. Averaging these two numbers leads to an estimate of $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in Colorado for that month. This data can be used to estimate the national sales tax base by extrapolating it to other states and the District of Columbia. The national sales tax base for recreational marijuana can be estimated by multiplying the recreational sales tax base from Colorado by each state's population and marijuana usage rates. This calculation assumes variations in consumption are based on population and usage rates, not price changes. Using data from August 2014, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be around $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year.
