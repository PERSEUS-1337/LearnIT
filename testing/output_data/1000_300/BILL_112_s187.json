    "content": "The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" requires manufacturers to ensure a certain percentage of dual-fueled automobiles and light duty trucks for sale in the United States. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates manufacturers to produce dual-fueled vehicles with specific percentages for different model years. An exception is made for vehicles running solely on electricity. Additionally, a new section is added to the code, and regulations must be established within a year of the Act's enactment. Furthermore, there is a provision for promoting blender pumps. The \"Blender Pump Grant Program\" defines key terms like blender pump, E-85 fuel, and ethanol fuel blend for dispensing different gasoline-ethanol blends. The \"Blender Pump Grant Program\" defines terms like blend, major fuel distributor, and Secretary for granting funds to eligible facilities. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants to eligible facilities for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure and providing subgrants to direct retailers of ethanol fuel blends. The Secretary of Energy provides grants for installing ethanol fuel blend infrastructure, including blender pumps and storage tanks. Major fuel distributors are not eligible for these grants. The Federal government covers up to 50% of the project costs. Retailers must offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years within a 4-year period after installation. The Secretary authorizes appropriations for the installation of ethanol fuel blend infrastructure, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2012 to 2015. If a facility or retailer receiving a grant does not offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years within a 4-year period, they must repay the Secretary an appropriate amount, not exceeding the grant provided. The Clean Air Act authorizes appropriations for ethanol fuel blend infrastructure installation, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Major fuel distributors are required to install blender pumps at owned and branded stations, with E-85 fuel defined as a blend of gasoline containing approximately 85% ethanol. In the Clean Air Act, E-85 fuel is defined as a blend of gasoline with 85% ethanol content, while an ethanol fuel blend contains a mix of gasoline and ethanol ranging from 0% to 85%. Major fuel distributors, defined as those owning or marketing refinery output, are mandated to install blender pumps at their stations. The term 'fuel distributor' refers to a person owning a refinery or marketing its output. A 'major fuel distributor' excludes those marketing through less than 50 retail fueling stations. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Energy. Regulations will be promulgated to ensure compliance by major fuel distributors. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations for at least 5 years. Regulations will be enforced to ensure compliance. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations for a period of not less than 5 years. Compliance will be enforced based on specified percentages. The Secretary will mandate major fuel distributors to provide E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at designated stations, with increasing percentages over the years: 10% in 2014, 20% in 2016, 35% in 2018, and 50% from 2020 onwards. The Secretary will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at specified percentages in their stations across each State. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at specified percentages in each State, with distributors assuming full financial responsibility for the costs. The major fuel distributors are required to assume full financial responsibility for installing blender pumps and necessary equipment to ensure proper function. Production credits are earned if the distributor exceeds the installation requirements for blender pumps at their stations. The major fuel distributor can earn credits by installing blender pumps exceeding the required percentage in a calendar year. These credits can be sold to other distributors to help them meet the installation requirements. The major fuel distributor can sell credits to another distributor to help them meet installation requirements, but these credits cannot be used to fulfill geographic distribution requirements. SEC. 4. Loan guarantees for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines. Loan guarantees for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines are defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with specific definitions for renewable fuel and renewable fuel pipelines included. The guarantee amount for such projects is specified in the Act. Loan guarantees for renewable fuel pipelines are defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with the guarantee amount set at 80% of the project cost. Eligibility for renewable fuel pipelines is added to the Act, and rapid deployment of these pipelines is addressed in an amendment to the Act. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include the installation of infrastructure for clean energy technologies, such as renewable fuel pipelines, with loan guarantees covering 80% of the cost. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include infrastructure for clean energy technologies, with loan guarantees covering 80% of the cost. The Secretary of Energy must promulgate regulations within 90 days to implement the amendments."
