    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held hearings on natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. This report highlights global natural gas markets, supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. The United States has become a leader in the shale gas revolution, increasing its natural gas resources. This has prompted other countries to explore shale gas, but progress is slow outside of North America. The U.S. started exporting liquefied natural gas in 2016, potentially playing a larger role in the global economy. Natural gas could have a larger role in the global economy if the United States and other countries can bring new volumes to market at a competitive price. Factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations will determine the market's growth. With its growing resource base and low carbon emissions, natural gas is likely to play a greater role in the world energy mix. Natural gas is expected to have a larger role in the global energy mix due to its growing resource base and low carbon emissions. The United States consumed the most natural gas in 2015, with shale gas playing a significant role in increasing reserves and production. This has shifted the U.S. from a net importer to a potential net exporter of natural gas, contributing to the increasing global trade in natural gas. The U.S. natural gas position has shifted from a net importer to a potential net exporter due to new shale gas resources. Global natural gas trade is increasing, with new players entering the market. In 2015, the world consumed 122,442 bcf of natural gas, making it the third-largest energy source behind oil and coal. The United States was the largest consumer, followed by Russia. Russia's natural gas consumption declined by 8% between 2011 and 2015 due to a weak economic environment. Global natural gas consumption grew at 1.7%, below the 10-year average of 2.3%. Natural gas consumption in Russia has declined by 8% between 2011 and 2015 due to a weak economic environment. Global consumption of natural gas grew at 1.7%, with the United States, Iran, and China experiencing increased consumption. China, as one of the largest global energy consumers, accounts for almost half of the world's total coal consumption and has a growing economy. Despite an increase in natural gas use over the past decade, it still only makes up about 5% of China's energy consumption. China, one of the largest global energy consumers, accounts for almost half of the world's total coal consumption. Despite an increase in natural gas use over the past decade, it only makes up about 5% of China's energy consumption. Iran, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, has a thriving domestic energy demand that has increased by 50% since 2004. The majority of Iran's natural gas production is consumed domestically, with natural gas comprising 60% of its total primary energy consumption in 2014. The lifting of international sanctions on Iran began in early 2016 following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Iran's natural gas production is mainly consumed domestically, accounting for 60% of its total primary energy consumption in 2014. The lifting of international sanctions in 2016 raised discussions on Iran's capacity for natural gas production and its role in the global energy market. In comparison, the United States is the largest consumer of natural gas, with 27,463 bcf consumed in 2015, making up nearly 23% of global consumption. Electric power generation is the largest sector for natural gas usage in the U.S., followed by industrial, residential, and commercial sectors. The rise in natural gas use for power generation is attributed to low prices due to abundant domestic resources. The U.S. industrial sector increased its natural gas consumption by 10% between 2010 and 2015, with industrial, residential, and commercial sectors accounting for 27%, 17%, and 12% of gas consumption in 2015, respectively. The rise in natural gas use for power generation is due to low prices from abundant domestic resources, with demand expected to grow by 40% by 2040. Global proved natural gas reserves amounted to 6,599,400 bcf. Global proved natural gas reserves totaled 6,599,400 bcf in 2015, with a 53-year supply at current production levels. Reserves have grown by 19% since 2005, mainly controlled by government-owned companies. Russia's Gazprom and Iran's National are among the top reserve holders. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, driven by shale gas development. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, with the U.S. accounting for 22% of total production. Between 2005 and 2015, U.S. natural gas production increased by 50%. In 2015, U.S. natural gas production increased by 5.4%, reaching 27,086 bcf. The growth was driven by unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, accounting for 85% of the increase since 2012. Despite low prices, U.S. natural gas production has been steadily rising, with a 65% increase between 2005 and 2015. Shale gas production is projected to increase by 73% by 2040, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. Overall, U.S. natural gas production has been steadily rising since 2012, with shale gas production projected to increase by 73% by 2040. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade is also on the rise, with a 1.8% increase in 2015 and a 33% share in the global gas trade. Countries like Australia and the United States are expanding their LNG export capacity. In response to the increasing LNG trade, many countries are expanding their export capacity. Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016. The U.S. natural gas market is transitioning, with a focus on modifying and expanding existing LNG terminals for increased export capacity. The U.S. natural gas market is undergoing a transition with a push for modification and expansion of existing LNG terminals to increase export capacity. Technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have boosted domestic natural gas supply, particularly from unconventional resources like shale. Production has shifted to regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast. The Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast have impacted natural gas transportation, reducing the need for gas from other regions. Increased production from shale plays like Marcellus has lowered prices and decreased imports. The U.S. is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas by 2017, with the first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurring in February 2016. The United States has transitioned from a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, offering a potential shipping route for U.S. LNG to Asian markets. However, only 10% of LNG carriers can fit the canal, raising questions for policymakers about the effects of natural gas exports. The United States has become a net exporter of natural gas, with the potential for LNG shipments through the Panama Canal. This strategic position raises questions about the impact on domestic gas prices, shale gas resources, and water usage in hydraulic fracturing. The growth of U.S. natural gas production has raised concerns about water quality and quantity near hydraulic fracturing sites. The EPA is studying the impact on drinking water, with worries about deep-well injection causing human-induced earthquakes. Emissions from the natural gas sector also raise concerns about their impact on human health. The concern with deep-well injection of wastewater is its potential link to human-induced earthquakes, as seen in the increased number of earthquakes. Methane emissions from the natural gas sector are also worrisome due to their impact on human health and the environment. The EPA has established national air standards to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions in the natural gas sector, covering various equipment in the gas production chain. The EPA updated the 2012 NSPS in 2016 to include more equipment in the gas production chain, such as natural gas well sites, processing plants, and compressor stations. Methane emissions from natural gas are a concern for policymakers as production expands in the US. Around 30% of natural gas is traded internationally, primarily through pipelines or as LNG, with increasing amounts being traded. Global natural gas trade is increasing, with LNG playing a significant role. LNG trade grew by 1.8% in 2015, accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Most natural gas is sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, except in the US where prices are market-based. Long-term contracts, typically 20 years, are common for international gas trade due to the high cost of transportation. US LNG exports have influenced other countries to reconsider their pricing strategies. Global natural gas trade is increasing, with LNG playing a significant role. Long-term contracts, usually 20 years, are common for international gas trade due to the high cost of transportation. LNG producers can sell excess gas on the spot market. Russia and Qatar are major players in the natural gas export market, targeting Europe and Asia respectively. Europe is the largest importing region for natural gas. Qatar is the leading exporter of LNG, with 31% of the world trade in 2015 going to Asia and Europe. Europe imports natural gas mainly from Russia, Norway, and Algeria, but is seeking more secure sources. Asia relies heavily on LNG, with China increasingly importing gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico being the only recipient of U.S. natural gas by pipeline. Mexico's imports are expected to increase from 1 tcf in 2015. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico being the only recipient of U.S. natural gas by pipeline. Exports to Mexico are expected to increase to almost 1.5 tcf by 2040, while exports to Canada are projected to slightly rise to 0.75 tcf. U.S. LNG prices are market-based, creating an economic incentive for the United States to export domestically produced natural gas. The first cargo of U.S. LNG was shipped from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana to Brazil in February 2016, sparking debate on how U.S. natural gas may affect the global market and geopolitics. The export of U.S. LNG has been a topic of debate among policymakers, with questions on its impact on the global market and domestic prices. Currently, there is one LNG export terminal in operation and several projects under construction in the lower-48 states. Additionally, the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska continues to supply LNG to Japan, and the United States started shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers. In 1969, the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan. The United States began shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers in February 2016. Natural gas from these shipments is sold at a higher price than Sabine Pass exports. A small amount of LNG was also shipped to Honolulu in 2014. Alaska has great potential as a major source of natural gas, with estimates exceeding 200,000 bcf on the North Slope. The US has vast natural gas resources in Alaska's North Slope, potentially exceeding 200,000 bcf. However, most gas is reinjected for oil production. Alaskan officials aim to sell gas internationally as LNG, but face commercial challenges. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement may impact US natural gas trade, expediting permits for exports to member countries. The TPP and TTIP trade agreements could impact US natural gas trade by granting free trade status to key consumers of LNG. The TPP expedites permits for natural gas exports to member countries, while the TTIP aims to promote trade and economic growth between the US and the EU. The UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015 addressed climate change and sought a universal agreement on necessary steps. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in April 2016 to address climate change and establish measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. However, U.S. infrastructure for natural gas may struggle to keep up with growing supplies due to aging pipelines. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines may be challenging to raise given other infrastructure demands. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines between 2015 and 2030 may be difficult to raise due to other infrastructure demands. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), a cartel organization based in Qatar, comprises 11 natural gas producing countries with a significant global market share. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) was formed in 2001 and comprises 11 natural gas producing countries with a significant global market share. Together, they account for 62% of global natural gas reserves, 57% of LNG trade, and 39% of pipeline gas trade. The U.S. resource base makes it unlikely for the GECF to significantly affect U.S. natural gas consumption in the near future. Europe, heavily reliant on cartel members like Russia and Algeria for gas imports, is most vulnerable to possible cartel control. However, the current market structure limits supply or price manipulation, requiring significant changes for any impact. The current structure of natural gas markets, with long-term contracts and specific pipelines, hinders supply or price manipulation by the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). Global natural gas production grew by 2.2% in 2015, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. The United States surpassed Russia as the largest natural gas producer in 2009, prompting other countries to evaluate their shale gas potential. However, significant commercial production outside of the U.S. and Canada is unlikely before the end of the decade due to lack of data and technology. Outside of Canada and the United States, significant commercial production of shale gas in other countries is unlikely before the end of the decade due to lack of data, technology, and equipment. Natural gas prices in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom are market-driven, with various hubs providing competitive price data. The Henry Hub in Erath, LA is a well-known hub in the U.S., where different categories of consumers pay varying prices. By 2040, the EIA projects a rise in the Henry Hub natural gas spot price. By 2040, the EIA projects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to rise to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) due to increased demand. This would require more well completions to meet production levels. Wholesale natural gas outside the US, Canada, and the UK is typically sold under long-term contracts linked to crude oil prices. In the US, Canada, and the UK, wholesale natural gas is sold under long-term contracts linked to crude oil prices. The disparity between contract and spot prices has led to pressure on gas producers to incorporate spot prices into their pricing formulas, especially in Asia where high prices are paid to secure natural gas supplies. Incorporating spot prices into pricing formulas is crucial in the natural gas industry, especially in Asia where high prices are paid to secure supplies. Key contract concepts include take-or-pay clauses, where buyers must pay regardless of gas receipt, and destination clauses, allowing redirection to different buyers. This contributes to a more efficient market. The natural gas industry faces the question of whether it should become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand by 2040, with most coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. As North America produces more unconventional gas, the global energy landscape is shifting. China and the Middle East are projected to drive new demand for natural gas, while North America leads in unconventional gas production. China's shift to a services-focused economy may reduce future energy needs by 85%, making predictions uncertain. India is expected to contribute significantly to global energy demand, requiring a substantial financial commitment of nearly $2.8 trillion. India is projected to contribute 25% to the global rise in energy demand by 2040, requiring a significant financial commitment of $2.8 trillion. Natural gas currently makes up 6% of India's energy supply and is expected to account for less than 10% of the energy mix by 2040. The U.S. electric power industry leads in natural gas demand growth due to factors like low prices and competitive financing. Government policies on carbon dioxide emissions will influence the growth of natural gas usage globally, with projections showing it will make up 28% of total world electricity generation by 2040. Natural gas production needs to increase to meet rising demand and prevent price spikes. Unconventional gas resources like coal bed methane, shale gas, and tight gas contribute to 60% of global gas supply growth. China's production is hindered by limited water availability and population density in resource-rich areas. Global natural gas production faces challenges such as limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas. Reaching full capacity may be hindered by these factors."
