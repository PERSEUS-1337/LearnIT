    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2008\". Congress finds that justice is served when all parties in litigation have experienced counsel, protecting attorney-client privileged communications promotes compliance with the law, and clarity on the privilege enhances organizations' compliance programs and internal investigations. Investigations are more effective when there is clarity and consistency regarding attorney-client privilege. Prosecutors and investigators can conduct their work while respecting these protections and individuals' rights. Law enforcement can investigate effectively without privileged information, as seen in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Despite having numerous investigative tools available. The Department of Justice and other agencies have policies that undermine the adversarial system of justice by pressuring organizations to waive attorney-client privilege to avoid indictment. Indictments can have severe consequences for organizations, potentially hindering their ability to survive or defend against charges at trial. The purpose of this Act is to set clear limits on government agencies' demands that encroach on employees' constitutional rights and legal protections, including the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. These demands should not be used to conceal wrongdoing or evade the law.
